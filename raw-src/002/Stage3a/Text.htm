          <P>Preface</P>
          <P>Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists that mankind has seen and stands as an individual whose intelligence was perhaps the ultimate. He tackled the very fundamental questions in physics. He probed deeply into the heart of things and was never happy with superficial knowledge. He questioned, questioned and questioned. He accepted nothing that was imposed upon him. The result, as many are aware, was the Theory of Relativity which proposed a new interpretation of gravity. </P>
          <P>One wonders – what was his life like? Did he always think of science and nothing else? Was he absent-minded? How was he at school? Was he the smartest student in class? Did he outdo his classmates in examinations? How was his personal life? What about his children? Were they as intelligent? </P>
          <P>In this book I have attempted to take the reader through a journey into Einstein’s life and answer such questions. During the course of my research, as I collated and sifted through the vast literature that is available about Einstein, I was excited and exhilarated. It appears he lived like most of us; yet, endowed with a spark of genius he surpassed the greatest scientists of his time. I have tried to develop this aspect of his life. </P>
          <P>Today, there are numerous books about Einstein and his achievements; most of them academic and very authoritative. This is a simple book which students in universities and people with a basic knowledge of physics can read and appreciate. Of course, I owe a lot to books already written, Internet sites and TV documentaries about Einstein and Relativity. Visits to the Einstein Museum and his apartment in Bern offered useful insights.</P>
          <P>I did not want to stop at merely tracing Einstein’s life. In an attempt to capture the essence of his theories, I have briefly delineated the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity in simple terms in Part 2. By no means complete, I think this will encourage the reader to explore more deeply. </P>
          <P>This book is part of a series on great scientists published by Prism Books Pvt. Ltd. My book on Srinivasa Ramanujan, the great mathematician has already been published. </P>
          <P>I thank Pranesh Siravara of the Prism Books for undertaking to publish this book and his staff for an efficient production. I particularly appreciate the great editing work done by Shubha Srikanth in making the book more readable and tangible to the average reader.</P>
          <P>After completing the first draft of the manuscript, I read a few pages every Thursday to the working group on non-fiction at the New South Wales Writers Centre in Sydney. Members of the Centre, the late Charles Cox , Alita Tanswell, Aleit Woodward , Don Morison, Filip Rafaneli, Jules Lewicki, Helen Lyne and Suzanne Wohlthat, offered many valuable suggestions to make my text more coherent. Brian Bell and Chakravarthy Madhusudana have read the manuscript word by word and suggested changes. I am indebted to all of them. </P>
          <P>Of course, such a book was possible only because of the support and understanding of my wife Usha.</P>

          <P>Einstein and the Modern World</P>
          <P>November 6, 1919 was a significant day not just for physicists but for the entire scientific community. The occasion that marked this day in the annals of world history was the outcome of the joint session of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain at Burlington House in Piccadilly, London. Appropriately, a magnificent portrait of one of the greatest scientists overlooked the audience. Paradoxically, it was his theory that was being challenged. Well, the scientist in question was Sir Isaac Newton.</P>
          <P>The bigwigs of the scientific community had gathered to discuss Sir Arthur Eddington’s observations during a solar eclipse that had occurred a few months earlier. Eddington had conducted this study to validate the newly proposed General Theory of Relativity, by a relatively unknown scientist called Albert Einstein.</P>
          <P>Albert Einstein had first presented his theory to the scientific community in 1915 leading to a novel interpretation of gravity. This interpretation, if validated would disprove some of the earlier scientific conceptions built on the basis of Newton’s Law of Gravitation. Scientists were awestruck by Einstein’s theory which conceived gravity as a product of the curvature of the four dimensional space time continuum. However, the theory was still a theory; it was yet to be validated, thus providing tremendous scope for aspiring scientists. </P>
          <P>The theory, among other things, proposed that a ray of light bends or deflects in a gravitational field. Consider, for example, light travelling from a distant star that bends as it approaches the sun because of the sun’s massive gravitational field. Newton’s theory had also suggested a deflection of light. But the magnitude of deflection proposed was different. Newton’s theory predicted that a ray of light deflects by 0.85 seconds of arc, while Einstein’s estimated the deflection at 1.71 seconds of arc. </P>
          <P>Could this curvature be verified to validate Einstein’s theory? There were challenges to experimentation and study; foremost being, the impossibility of viewing a distant star in the presence of a bright sun. A total solar eclipse seemed an opportune moment, as the sun’s light would be obscured by the moon. Nature obliged and gave scientists a chance. A total solar eclipse was to occur on May 29, 1919 at Principe, a small Portuguese island, off the west coast of Africa. Eddington assumed the responsibility of conducting an experiment to verify Newton’s theory. His report was to be tabled before the joint session. </P>
          <P>The war had just ended; Germany and Britain were still enemies. So this scientific debate for many boiled down to the question - who will win? Britain led by Isaac Newton or Germany led by Albert Einstein. The audience, mostly scientists, waited with bated breath in sheer schoolboy spirit, eager to discover the winner of the Ashes! The British mathematician and philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead, who was present at the meeting recollects, “The whole atmosphere of tense interest was exactly that of Greek drama: we were the chorus commenting on the decree of destiny as disclosed in the development of a supreme incident.”</P>
          <P>Frank Dyson (Astronomer Royal of England) presented the report and concluded, “After a careful study of the plates, I am prepared to say that there can be no doubt that they confirm Einstein’s predictions. The results of the expeditions to Sobral and Principe leave little doubt that a deflection of light takes place in the neighbourhood of the sun and that it is of the amount demanded by Einstein’s generalised Theory of Relativity.” </P>
          <P>The President of the Royal Society, Nobel Laureate J. J. Thomson (the physicist credited to have discovered the electron) hailed, “The result is one of the greatest achievements of human thought.” </P>
          <P>History had turned a page and mankind was transported into the post-Newton era. A new physics was in the making. As we shall see later, Einstein had shaken the very foundations of our beliefs; he categorically dismissed our conception of absolute space and absolute time. Einstein was no longer just an anonymous professor in Berlin; his name was suddenly on par with Isaac Newton! </P>
          <P>Einstein became the talk of the town. Relativity was a topic for discussion in newspapers, radio and other media. Commented Einstein, “Currently every coachman and every waiter is debating whether the Relativity Theory is correct”. Einstein, now out of the ivory tower of science had become an instant celebrity. His colleagues stood astonished at the brilliance of his thought; heads of states, queens and princesses longed for his company; people flocked for a glimpse of him. The celebrated filmmaker Charlie Chaplin escorted Einstein to the premiere of his movie City Lights. Surprised by Einstein’s popularity he remarked, “There are people more popular than I!” Once while travelling by train, a co-passenger innocently asked Einstein what he did for a living. Einstein replied, “I am a model posing for newspapers!”</P>
          <P>Sir Arthur Eddington, on discovering the results of his experiment exclaimed, “This is the greatest day in my life!” However, he could not communicate his findings to Einstein directly; war had rendered communication difficult in Germany. The news reached Einstein through a circuitous path via Holland. Einstein opened the telegram, read it and passed it to a student sitting in front of him. The student jumped with joy and asked Einstein, “Aren’t you moved that they have proved your theory to be correct? What would you have done if they had shown it otherwise?” Nonchalantly, Einstein replied, “I would have felt sorry for the Lord I know my theory is correct.” So sure was he.</P>
          <P>Galileo, Newton and Einstein are the pillars of contemporary physics. They have helped us better understand our world and universe; shaped our ideas about space and time; and have provided possible answers to some eternal questions – How did the universe begin? When? What is gravity? What are the forces that govern our universe? If we believe we have discovered answers to such questions, then certainly we owe a great deal to these three men; they belong not just to the countries they come from, not just to the times they lived in, but to the whole of mankind. Galileo gave us the scientific method and stressed the importance of experiments, for, as he said, ‘Theory guides and experiment decides’. Isaac Newton formulated the Laws of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. Einstein then continued the relay race and conceived the Theory of Relativity to give us a new interpretation of gravity. </P>
          <P>Some believe that Einstein is the greatest scientist ever born. This may be true. Albert Einstein is perhaps one name familiar to scientists, common people, students and housewives, thus covering the entire cross section of society. Very few have understood his Theory of Relativity but most have heard of the formula E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>. Even today Einstein is a symbol of the highest intelligence; one who has achieved the greatest that is humanly conceivable; he represents the upper limit to the human intellect. Some people went to the extent of wondering if there was something special in his brain that was not there in theirs!</P>
          <P>What is this Theory of Relativity? Why is it so famous? What does it tell us? To begin with, the Theory of Relativity challenges our basic assumptions of time and space. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravitational Force assume that there is a fixed space and a fixed time which flows like a river. Dimensions of space are absolute in the sense that they are the same for every observer. So is time. What are ten minutes for one person are ten minutes for all. </P>
          <P>The Theory of Relativity, however, shows that both space and time are relative. The length of an object and the time that elapses between events depends upon the speed of the observer. The theory led to the conclusion that almost everything in this universe is relative; there is nothing absolute. Effects of Relativity become particularly pronounced at great speeds. However, it is important to remember that Newton’s Laws are valid at low speeds in the turn of everyday events. </P>
          <P>But when we consider speeds of satellites and planets we have to account for the relativistic effects. Space travel definitely owes a lot to Relativity. If we today boast of an accurate GPS system that guides us to a desired destination, it is because the relativistic effects have been accounted for in the calculations. </P>
          <P>At the other end of the spectrum is the motion inside an atom--the subatomic motion. Newton’s theory was inadequate for the study of motion of subatomic particles, while Einstein’s Relativity facilitated an insight into this realm of motion. We can find the application of Einstein’s theory in many gadgets of everyday use such as photocells, lasers and nuclear power plants. </P>
          <P>Every student today has heard of the formula E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>, which represents the equivalence of mass and energy and helps calculate the quantity of energy that is released when an atom is split. This formula is commonly and mistakenly associated with the atomic bomb. But in reality, Einstein played no role in the Manhattan project which built the atomic bomb. He in fact was deeply anguished when the first bomb was dropped over Japan. Ironically, he was preaching peace when this event occurred. The redeeming fact is that the same equation enabled mankind to generate large quantities of electrical power in nuclear power stations. The famed formula morphed into an equation of war and peace! </P>
          <P>Though the Theory of Relativity is generally accepted today, attempts to test it and refine it are continuing. Research to testify the theory was conducted as recently as in 2010 and 2011. </P>
          <P>A great lesson one learns from Einstein is to question, question and question. All through his life he never accepted authority--academic, political or cultural. It is this aspect of his personality that made him look beyond the ordinary course of events perceptible to common sense. He opined, “Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen”. He did not blindly accept what was written in textbooks, what his teachers or parents told him or what most people believed in. He explored, argued, looked for evidence and broke new ground. </P>
          <P>The world wars had initiated a passionate need to redefine life and the world. The early years of the 20<SPAN><Sup>th</Sup></SPAN> century were marked by a new intellectual fervour characterised by non-conformity to established norms and accepted worldviews in every area of human activity. Picasso looked at art in a different way and introduced cubism in painting; James Joyce broke new ground in literature by writing Ulysses; T. S. Eliot wrote Waste Land which pioneered new form and content in poetry writing; Freud published psychoanalysis, initiating a whole new understanding of human behaviour; and Stravinsky altered the very mode of composing music. Einstein lived in this atmosphere where change was inevitable. It was time to break away from routine ideas. Like art, music and literature, science too entered the modern era. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s focus was always at the macro level. He never concerned himself with secondary, superfluous problems in physics. He tackled only fundamental issues. Einstein was often heard saying, “I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts; the rest are details”. Einstein’s beliefs are an assertion that all great men are seekers of eternal truth; and for Einstein that truth is the unifying principle underlying all Creation. </P>
          <P>At heart, Einstein was a philosopher. He saw beauty and truth in all of God’s creation. This beauty he perceived in mathematics; discovering beauty and simplicity in scientific theories became the pursuit of his life. It was because of this conviction that he rejected some of the outcomes of Quantum Mechanics, a branch of physics he helped develop. It is also true that he tried in vain, for a large part of his later life, to unify electromagnetic and gravitational forces. Now in 2014, scientists have made substantial progress in this direction. In fact two more forces, Strong and Weak have been included. But we are not sure whether the simplicity and beauty that Einstein yearned for has been achieved. Till his death he remained a pilgrim in pursuit of truth--Is there a unified theory? </P>
          <P>His personal life was hardly a bed of roses. His life in school and college was not very enjoyable because of his disrespect and scepticism towards high-handed teachers who had little interest in arousing the curiosity of children or in making learning enjoyable. Securing a job to make a living also proved difficult. Of course, later in life, his scientific achievements took him to the highest academic and professional echelons.</P>
          <P>A scientist of Einstein’s calibre who has contributed substantially to the furtherance of knowledge and has also been conferred the Nobel Prize usually occupies the high chair of director of an institution or university and creates a conducive platform to guide next-generation scientists. Einstein did not like to be bound by such affiliations. A free spirit, he nurtured an impressive band of physicists such as Niels Bohr, Max Born, Irwin Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Robert Oppenheimer and de Broglie, in whose leadership modern physics developed phenomenally. It seemed as though a Nobel Prize was a minimum requirement for a person to be associated with Einstein! </P>
          <P>Einstein never chased fame or glory. There was no trace of pomp or conceit in thought or action. He commented at the peak of his fame, “When I was young all I wanted and expected from life was to sit quietly in some corner doing my work without public paying attention to me. And now see what has become of me!”</P>
          <P>Einstein preserved a childlike innocence and curiosity about all things; he never lost himself to dress; he abhorred flattery. He never lusted for power. He could have become the president of Israel if only he had accepted the invitation. He preferred to lead the life of an ordinary man. Humility was his trademark. When he was forced to write his autobiography, he wrote one and called it his obituary! Besides it turned out to be more a history of science than an insight into his life and work. It did not mention any biographical details, names of family or relatives. Instead, it included names of great scientists, and it did mention the compass of which we will read later.</P>
          <P>Not that Einstein became a recluse, totally absorbing himself in science. As he became famous he took upon himself several social and moral responsibilities. He wept for his fellow Jews and openly promoted their cause. He greatly admired Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence, peace and self-governance and was deeply grieved when he was assassinated. He pleaded and dissuaded the president of America from making the atomic bomb, though he had initially urged the president to develop the bomb, mistakenly assuming rival countries to be engaged in developing it. He continually appealed to world leaders to promote peace. </P>
          <P>Thus Einstein was a great humanitarian; a human being whom mankind will not forget, and one whose legacy will live forever. He is a phenomenon that flashed upon the surface of earth. He will be remembered as one of the greatest men that ever lived. He has been compared with Picasso, Freud and Gandhi, and hailed as a genius of the twentieth century. </P>
          <P>Perhaps the best description of what Einstein stands for today is given by Maria Spiropulu, an experimental physicist at Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago, in her essay, “Where is Einstein?” –</P>
          <P>“And where is Einstein today? In our research, our studies, our experiments, our calculations. In college textbooks from physics to the history of culture. In our witticisms. In the hearts of our friends and colleagues who call in the middle of the night with some preposterous idea about how to solve a preposterous problem. In the hearts of the artists and businessmen and electricians and philosophers we meet who want to know what E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> really means as soon as they know we are physicists. In intellectuals who know how to be cute and modest and play the media. In those who take sides. In every demonstration against nuclear weapons. In all young people who exhibit a slight disrespect for authority and all old people in authority who are radicals. In those who have fled from tyrannical and oppressive families and narrow minded educators. In all our students who can solve a problem we cannot. In all the people we think as innocent geniuses who take themselves not very seriously. In all stubborn and difficult physicists who think of physics problems as a reason for being. And in all those who tackle problems they know they can’t or won’t solve.” </P>

          <P>Childhood</P>
          <P>Albert’s father Hermann Einstein and mother Pauline Koch formerly lived in Buchau, a village in the Swabian region of south Germany. Their ancestors had been living in Germany for nearly two hundred years and by now were well assimilated into the German culture. They were mostly tradesmen and peddlers living in villages. The Einstein family was not very religious, showing little interest in rituals. Hermann had some aptitude for mathematics and managed to study in a school in Stuttgart, seventy-five miles from home. </P>
          <P>University study, however, was not affordable; so Hermann discontinued his education and took to trade. This prompted the family to move from the village to an industrial town called Ulm, thirty five miles away. Hermann’s cousin owned a featherbed company in Ulm and took him as a partner. It is here that Hermann met Pauline Koch and married her. Albert Einstein was their first child and was born in Ulm at 11:30 am on March 14, 1879, a Friday. </P>
          <P>When Einstein rose to fame, the street where his family lived was named Einsteinstrasse (Einstein Street). Subsequently, when Nazis came to power the street name was changed to Frichtestrasse. The house where the Einstein family had lived was demolished leaving no traces of the great man. However, after the fall of the Nazis, the street once again became Einsteinstrasse. </P>
          <P>Within a year after Albert’s birth, the featherbed business failed. Hermann had to look for a new job. He teamed up with his brother Jacob who owned a gas and electric company in Munich. The firm manufactured and supplied generators and lighting equipment to nearby municipalities. While Jacob provided technical expertise, Hermann took care of the business-side of the firm and also brought in the required capital through his wife who had a rich father. The family then moved to Munich.</P>
          <P>In November 1881, Hermann and Pauline had a daughter. She was named Maria, but was called Maja. Albert liked his sister immensely; in the beginning, he mistook her for a doll and asked, “Where are the wheels?” Thus began a lifelong intimate relationship between brother and sister. Albert and Maja were inseparable all their life. Maja has also written a short account of Einstein’s childhood. </P>
          <P>For nearly three years after he was born, Albert had not begun to speak and his parents were obviously worried. A doctor was consulted. However, he did talk eventually. But there was a difference; he would compose whatever he wanted to say, rehearse it mentally and then speak; besides he preferred to think not in words, but in pictures. He has said, “I very rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterwards.” He has also said, “Retarded progress worked well for me. I hardly thought as a child. I always thought as an adult.” </P>
          <P>Maja writes that young Albert hardly mixed or played with boys of his own age. He preferred to be alone, engaging in activities such as solving puzzles and constructing models with his building set. He could build a structure of fourteen floors with cards. Unlike children of his age, he disliked the military parades that passed by his house and the music that the military band played. He never bothered to run out into the street to look at these parades. </P>
          <P>He was usually calm and quiet, but sometimes exhibited fits of temper. Once he threw a chair at a tutor who had come to help with his studies; the tutor fled never to return. Sometimes Maja was also a target of his attacks!</P>
          <P>Hermann and Pauline, though of middle class, had a big house with a garden where the children could play. Hermann valued education and wanted to see Albert become an engineer. </P>
          <P>When Albert was four or five years old, he fell ill and was bedridden. Hermann gave him a compass to cheer him up. It was not just an amusement for the young boy. The compass became an inspiration to ponder over a mystery which would haunt him all through his life. The compass needle always points towards the north; but why? It has no physical connection with the earth. What pulls the needle northwards? The small boy wondered. </P>
          <P>Of course, it is the earth’s magnetism. We know that the electromagnetic field that is active all over the earth is responsible for the compass pointing northward. But that was only a starting point. Einstein spent several years studying the forces of nature and the possibility of discovering a pattern or principle that could unify them. Says Einstein later, “I can still remember, or I believe I can remember, that this experience made a deep and lasting impression on me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.”</P>
          <P>Science and technology were his father’s contribution to him. His mother contributed in her own way. She was an accomplished pianist and played in her spare time. She wanted Albert to be trained in music and so enrolled him for violin lessons. Initially he resisted but gradually began to enjoy the lessons. Mozart’s sonatas proved to be the turning point. When he was thirteen he modified his technique of playing the piano to bring out more effectively what he felt was the artistic content of Mozart’s sonatas. Later on, he greatly appreciated the compositions of Beethoven. </P>
          <P>His mother Pauline frequently accompanied him on the piano. The violin became his life-long companion, in sorrow and happiness alike. When he could not make headway in some research-related problem, he would shut himself in the kitchen (apparently because the quality of sound produced in the tiled floor of the kitchen was superior) and play his violin. During the course of playing the violin he would have an epiphany! A solution would suddenly occur! Then he would come out of the kitchen saying, “I found it.” </P>
          <P>Mozart was his all-time favourite. He says, “Mozart’s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself.” Einstein always sought harmony in the universe. He wanted his theories to reflect the harmony he found in music, nature and God. Einstein was once asked, “Science is your father’s gift to you. Is music your mother’s gift?” He replied, “I have no gift, I am passionately curious, thus it is not a question of heredity.”</P>
          <P>Schooling</P>
          <P>Albert turned six and it was time for formal education. His parents were neither very religious nor adhered to any religious practices. Hence they did not worry that there was no Jewish school nearby. The Catholic school, Peterschule near their house seemed good enough. Albert and Maja both started their formal education here and took the standard Catholic lessons offered at school. Albert excelled in studies and would help his classmates too. He became very religious and tried to follow Jewish customs; he stopped eating pork, for example. He even composed hymns which he would sing on his way to and back from school. Einstein preserved a sense of religiousness throughout his life. A certain religiosity is necessary in the practice of science, which in reality is a pursuit of truth. </P>
          <P>By 1886, Albert was seven years old and was one of the brightest in class. What advancement from his early childhood when he could hardly speak!</P>
          <P>However, Albert liked neither the school nor the teachers. In those days German schools resembled military camps, in that strict discipline was enforced. Every classroom was a barrack and every teacher a lieutenant. </P>
          <P>When Albert was nine, he was admitted to the Luitpold Gymnasium, equivalent to a Higher Secondary School. Among other subjects he studied Greek, Latin, Geography and mathematics. He was never at ease with subjects that demanded remembering words and texts. He did not bother to remember lines from poems and plays! “You will never amount to anything,” chided his Greek teacher. However, he surprised everyone with his exam results; Albert had scored good grades in both Greek and Latin. </P>
          <P>Professor Ruess taught German literature and unlike other teachers he encouraged students to think and fostered in Albert a love for German literature and ancient civilizations. Einstein went to see Ruess later in life. Mistaking Einstein for a beggar, Ruess ordered him to be thrown out!</P>
          <P>Albert studied advanced physics and mathematics on his own and had mastered far beyond the syllabus prescribed in the school curriculum. He would spend days and nights trying to find solutions to challenging problems; as a young lad, friends and play-time took a backseat. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s uncle Jacob played an important role in Albert’s self-study of advanced mathematics. He taught him algebra. He compared solving an equation to hunting an animal x which is initially unknown. Only after actually hunting it down, would one be able to identify the animal. Even before he studied geometry in school, Albert had been introduced to the Pythagoras Theorem that states that the square on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. A curious school boy, he developed his own proof for the theorem! </P>
          <P>Albert’s interest in science received a further boost from a medical student called Max Talmud (who later migrated to USA and became Talmey). Jewish families followed the tradition of inviting young men pursuing theology (students generally) to dine with them once a week. This is how Albert became acquainted with Talmud. When they first met, Talmud was 21 and Albert, 10. He was surprised that Albert did not mingle with children his own age or play any sport. Talmud was responsible for expanding Albert’s intellectual horizon by introducing him to literature and philosophy. He lent him a copy of Kant’s famous Critique of Pure Reason. Kant’s work was considered incomprehensible to most ordinary mortals. But surprisingly, thirteen-year-old Albert was able to grasp the text exceedingly well. For some time, Kant was Einstein’s favourite philosopher. He pursued his interest in philosophy by reading David Hume and Ernst Mach to explore the nature of reality. </P>
          <P>Talmud shared with Albert many books on the subject of science. One such was Aaron Bernstein’s People’s Book on Natural Science, an illustrated work in 21 volumes written for the lay man. It made a huge impact on Albert. Bernstein has explored the relationship between physics and biology and has stressed the importance of experimentation in science. Einstein was particularly attracted to his discussion about the speed of light. He was so completely taken in by this phenomenon that it became a life-long obsession, culminating in his Theory of Relativity. The author proposes that electromagnetism is a wave phenomenon and so is light, and conjectures that the same may be true of gravity. We will see later that Bernstein’s scientific opinions significantly contributed towards Einstein’s theories. He remarked later, “A very good book, it has exerted a great influence on my whole development.” </P>
          <P>Talmud also gave Albert a small textbook on Euclidean geometry which influenced him in no less a measure than the compass. The book came to him two years before geometry was introduced in school. Albert called it a sacred little geometry book, and felt that there was a certain mystery in geometry. For example, the three altitudes of a triangle intersect at a point. This is not apparent or evident. But, for our young school boy the fact that this can be proved theoretically with certainty was a miracle. Says Einstein, “If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm, then you are not born to be a scientific thinker.” Talmud was surprised that Albert worked through the book within months.</P>
          <P>Albert at that tender age began to evolve a personal worldview, “It is possible to find truth by reasoning alone without the help of any outside experience.” This led him to declare later, “I became more and more convinced that nature could be understood as a relatively simple mathematical structure.”</P>
          <P>As Einstein’s experiences of the world increased, he became more and more sceptical about the stories in the Bible. It was as if youth was being deceived by lies. Out went his religious dogma. However, throughout his life he retained a reverential attitude towards the beauty and harmony in nature. He also questioned, dismissed and loathed authority in all aspects of life. Einstein’s non-conformity and contempt for power shaped his unconventional thinking and attitude. Ironically, Einstein himself became an authority later in his life. He has said, “To punish me for my contempt of authority, fate made me an authority myself.” </P>
          <P>His intelligence bloomed in school and he was a very bright student by any standard. But once again Albert did not like school; every teacher seemed to behave like a lieutenant. Albert would occupy the last benches and tease his teachers. Besides, he would ask questions for which they had no answers. Maybe the questions were too complex, beyond the grasp of mediocre minds.</P>
          <P>He openly indicated his dislike for them and the school, which annoyed the teachers. When he was in seventh grade, one of the teachers summoned him and asked him to leave the school. Albert challenged, “I have not done anything wrong. Why do you punish me like this?” The teacher replied, “Your mere presence spoils the respect of the class for me.” </P>
          <P>In 1894, his father’s factory suffered huge losses and had to be closed down. Hermann and Jacob decided to move to a town called Pavia near Milan in Italy. They did not want Albert to discontinue his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. He was boarded in a lodge so that he could continue his schooling and obtain a diploma. But Einstein was in a dilemma. Should he continue in his present school where discipline and order were enforced? Or should he move to Italy, stay with his parents and enjoy breathtaking views of nature? The latter seemed better. However, it was not easy to quit school and move away. </P>
          <P>Albert planned his next move meticulously. First of all, he was determined to give up his German citizenship as he felt it futile to stay in a country which prepared students primarily for a military life. He wanted to acquire Swiss citizenship. Now that he had crossed the age of fifteen, he realised that if he stayed there till he turned seventeen, he would then have to serve in the German army. He was certain he didn’t want to do so. </P>
          <P>In preparation to move to Swiss, Albert first met a doctor (actually, Talmud’s brother) and persuaded him to certify that he was of poor mental condition, and advise that he should join his parents to recuperate. Next, he managed to get a testimonial from his mathematics teacher stating that he was exceptionally good in mathematics and that he was competent for the demands of university education. </P>
          <P>With these two certificates in his pocket, Albert joined his parents in Italy. In effect, he had taken charge of his future. His ambition was to seek education in a Swiss university. But he was a school dropout with no diploma. So he convinced his parents that he would prepare on his own for the entrance examination. </P>
          <P>It was a sudden release from tyranny for Albert; there was no school, no teacher; none to enforce discipline, rules and regulations. He was free to do what he wanted. Albert studied physics, his favourite subject. He became absorbed in an advanced textbook to such an extent that he would sit on a sofa with a pencil and paper for hours on end. He even wrote a paper on Magnetic Field, which of course made little impact.</P>
          <P>He had now befriended Otto Neustatter and the duo hiked through the Apennine Mountains and to Genoa. En route, they visited museums, churches, art treasures and attended concerts. They were voracious readers. Italians seemed more warm-hearted than Germans. During this period he had occasion to closely observe the proceedings and processes at the factory run by his father and uncle, and gain firsthand knowledge of how magnets, generators and coils worked. He even helped his uncle with calculations. </P>
          <P>Hermann’s business went through many ups and downs. Albert felt obliged to support his family financially. But he was unwilling to forgo studies to earn a livelihood. Besides, he felt confident and well-prepared for the entrance examination to the Zurich Polytechnic. There was one drawback. Albert was too young and had to wait two years to take the examination. A relative of the family wrote to the director of the Polytechnic stating that Albert was an exceptional candidate and a prodigy, and requested that he be allowed to take the examination. Permission was granted. </P>
          <P>Albert sat the examination but failed in French, politics, zoology and botany. However, he had performed exceedingly well in science and mathematics. Prof. Heinrich Weber at the Zurich Polytechnic appreciated Albert’s performance in physics and took pity on him. He summoned Albert and permitted him to attend his lectures in physics. The Director of Zurich Polytechnic, Albin Herzog advised Albert that he would stand a good chance of clearing the polytechnic entrance test, if he first studied at the Swiss Cantonal School in the town of Aarau and earned a diploma. </P>
          <P>Aarau</P>
          <P>The Swiss Cantonal School was modelled after the philosophy of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, an educational reformer, who conceived a revolutionary and modern view of education. He preached learning by ‘head, hand and heart’ and learning by visualising, which was ideal for a free-thinking creative student like Albert. Unlike German schools, here every student was respected. Students learnt by observation and experimentation rather than by mere reading or by rote. Naturally, students were more relaxed; there was no authority demanding respect and instilling fear. Where fear is absent, respect comes naturally.</P>
          <P>He had been inspired by Bernstein’s book on natural science. Albert often wondered, ‘what will the world look like if I ride a beam of light?’ Such thought experiments were Einstein’s favourite pastime. </P>
          <P>Albert met the Wintelers family and fostered an everlasting relationship with them. Jost Winteler taught Greek and history at Aarau. The Wintelers had seven children. Later, Einstein’s sister Maja married Winteler’s son Paul, and Albert himself fell in love with Marie, Winteler’s daughter. Another of Winteler’s daughters, Anna, married Einstein’s friend Michele Angelo Besso. Winteler, like Einstein hated the nationalism and militarism that prevailed in Germany and preferred to be a citizen of the world. Hence, Albert’s dislike for such jingoism was further strengthened. </P>
          <P>Marie Winteler was 18 and Albert, 16 when they first met. She had completed a course in teaching and was looking for a job. They developed mutual admiration and exchanged letters. Albert’s mother approved the friendship. But, the relationship was short-lived. </P>
          <P>Albert had been asked to improve his knowledge of chemistry and French. He did so reluctantly. But music received his undivided attention. His music teacher felt he was the best in class. Listening to him play the violin, one of his friends asked, “Do you count beats?” Albert replied, “No, it is in my blood.”</P>
          <P>In 1896, with his father’s approval Albert renounced his German citizenship. It is interesting that Albert mentioned in his application that he had no religious denomination.</P>
          <P>One year of study at Aarau ended very well. Albert stood second in class in the annual examinations. We do not know who topped the class. Albert scored 5 or 6 out of 6 in all subjects except French in which he scored only 3. In his French examination, he had to write an essay about his ambitions. He expressed his desire to join the Zurich Polytechnic, study physics and become a teacher and his aptitude for abstract and mathematical thinking. Entry to the Zurich Polytechnic was well within his grasp now. </P>
          <P>It is popularly believed that Einstein failed in mathematics in high school. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Somehow, this myth has spread and prevailed. When Einstein was shown a newspaper report stating the same, he laughed and said, “How could this be? By the age of fifteen I had finished reading calculus!” </P>
          <P>In 1896, the partnership between Hermann and Jacob was dissolved. Jacob decided to join an engineering establishment as a paid employee. Hermann continued with the electrical engineering company hoping that Albert would study engineering and support him in his business someday. This was not to be. Albert was after physics which meant that he would seek an academic position.</P>

          <P>Polytechnic Days</P>
          <P> The Zurich Polytechnic (now called Eidgenossische Technische Hochshule, ETH) was primarily a teacher training institution with 841 students. Eleven students including Einstein trained in mathematics and physics. He had the generous support of a relative who gave him an allowance of 100 francs a month. Einstein kept aside 20 francs for the future, when he would apply for Swiss citizenship. </P>
          <P>Einstein was to study under Prof. Heinrich Weber, who had previously offered free admission to his lectures on theoretical physics, a new discipline in physics. Einstein, strong in physics, was weak in mathematics. His score in mathematics was around 4 out of 6. Geometry had pulled his score down. Hermann Minkowski, a mathematics professor, often linked physics and mathematics in his lectures. Einstein was greatly impressed and influenced by Minkowski. But observing that he paid little attention to mathematics, Minkowski called him a lazy dog. Later in life, when Einstein was developing his Theory of Relativity, Prof. Minkowski helped him with mathematics. </P>
          <P>Einstein took ten courses in physics offered by Prof. Weber. They were a mixture of lectures and practical work. In the beginning, Einstein liked the courses immensely and his admiration for Weber increased. However, by the end of two years, Einstein was disappointed as he felt that Weber discussed only the relatively older topics in physics. Einstein was more interested in recent developments. James Maxwell, Scottish mathematical physicist, had already published the electromagnetic theory and developed the Maxwell equations in 1855. These for Einstein were the living areas of physics, which he expected Weber to discuss in class. Einstein lost respect for him and was very open about it. The German practice was (and still is) to address professors as Herr Prof (Mr. Prof). But Einstein addressed his teacher as Herr Weber. Annoyed, Weber told Einstein, “You are a clever fellow. But you have one fault. You won’t let anyone tell you a thing.” Einstein paid a heavy price in his later days because of his irreverential attitude. </P>
          <P>Prof. Jean Pernet ran the laboratory classes at the polytechnic, which Einstein hardly attended. Pernet remarked that Einstein should have studied not physics, but medicine or law. Einstein’s characteristic reply was, “I have even less talent for those subjects. Why should I not try my luck in physics?”</P>
          <P>Pernet provided students a detailed instruction sheet for every experiment that was to be performed. While every other student followed the instructions religiously, Einstein would throw the sheet into the waste paper basket and perform the experiment in his own way. This annoyed Pernet; but not the assistant who watched Einstein perform. The assistant remarked, “His solutions are right and the method he uses are of interest.” This is not only an instance of Einstein’s genius in evolving his own methodology but also of his dislike for instructions and blind unthinking adherence to them. In 1899, while performing an experiment, Einstein caused an explosion and injured his right hand. He could not write for nearly two weeks; violin had to wait a bit longer. This could well be a reason for Einstein leaning heavily towards theoretical physics. </P>
          <P>His callous attitude towards discipline and order continued. He did not feel compelled to attend all lectures. When they were not to his liking, he quietly skipped them and went to a coffee club or a concert. In those days, professors lectured not by referring to textbooks as is the case today. Most professors were engaged in research and lectured about their own research and studies. Hence, what was taught in class was for the most part not found in textbooks. Today, students have a variety of sources to make up for lost lectures. </P>
          <P>Luckily Einstein found a good friend in Marcel Grossmann, a Jew, whose father owned a factory near Zurich. Grossmann as a rule attended all lectures and took notes meticulously, which according to Einstein were of publishable quality. Grossmann’s notes are displayed at the Einstein Museum in Bern. Grossmann lent Einstein all these notes and made his life easier. The two took long walks and discussed philosophy at Cafe Metropole on the banks of River Limmat. Theirs was a lifelong friendship; Grossmann helped Einstein find a job after he completed polytechnic. Friedrich Adler, whose father was the leader of Austria’s Social Democratic Party, was another colleague of Einstein.</P>
          <P>Einstein took it upon himself to make up for all that the teachers did not teach in the polytechnic. He made a serious study of the masters of theoretical physics such as Kirchhoff (radiation), Helmholtz (thermodynamics), Hertz (electromagnetism) and Boltzmann (statistical mechanics). He mastered the electromagnetic theory. Einstein also read the works of two other scientists, August Foppl and Henri Poincare. Foppl states that motion can only be defined relative to another body. Poincare came very close to formulating the Theory of Relativity stating there was nothing absolute in mechanics. No doubt, these works had a profound influence on Einstein’s future research. </P>
          <P>Outside the Polytechnic </P>
          <P>One afternoon Einstein was sitting in the lounge when he heard someone playing Mozart’s sonatas on the piano. He learnt from his landlady that it was the old lady next door, also a piano teacher. The music was an invitation in disguise for Einstein. He at once took his violin and rushed next door. The landlady cautioned him that he wore no tie or collar and it was improper to pay a visit dressed casually. Einstein did not seem to care. He went and accompanied the old lady on the violin much to her surprise. </P>
          <P>Einstein came across another music lover in Zurich, a young girl named Suzanne Markwalder. Her mother organised music sessions at home. Einstein actively participated on his violin. He even corrected her piano playing at times. Sailing was another pastime he pursued in Zurich.</P>
          <P>By now, Einstein had already earned the epithet of ‘absent minded professor’. He was least interested in dressing appropriately for various occasions. Forgetfulness had already become a characteristic. He would visit friends and relatives and return without his suitcase. Forgetting his house keys was a daily affair. </P>
          <P>Out of sight and out of mind. Marie Winteler slowly receded from Einstein’s mind. When he started the polytechnic course their love was still strong. In fact, Einstein would send her a basketful of soiled clothes to be washed and returned. The baskets were accompanied by Einstein’s letters on one way and by Marie’s on the return path. But slowly, the baskets that Marie received had only clothes and no letters. Obviously upset she begged that Einstein write as well. He did write to her, but to ask her to forget him! Einstein also wrote to Marie’s mother calling off the relationship. Marie was depressed. However, she recovered and married the manager of a watch factory. </P>
          <P>Mileva Marić</P>
          <P>What led Einstein to break his relationship with Marie so suddenly? Mileva Marić seems to be the reason. She joined the polytechnic at the same time as Einstein and was three years older than he. It was not physical beauty that attracted Einstein to Mileva. She had a congenital hip dislocation and limped. But like Einstein she loved science and mathematics. She was very intelligent and so the relationship started on an intellectual plane.</P>
          <P>Mileva was the daughter of Serbian peasants Milos Marić and Marija Marić and belonged to the Greek orthodox faith; she was born in 1875 in the province of Vojvodina, then in Hungary. She was proficient in both Serbian and German. Her father wanted to educate her in science and mathematics. Having done very well at school, Mileva obtained admission into the polytechnic. She had started studying medicine but changed her mind and transferred to physics. She was the only girl in Einstein’s class. She too liked music and was a talented pianist. </P>
          <P>People have wondered as to what brought them together. Mileva was very moody and had quite a temper. Then, perhaps it was her intellectual capability and independent nature? The two were equals in many senses and read important works on physics together. Initially she saw Einstein as an intellectual companion and not as a lover. By the start of the second year however, the two were hiking together. But something seems to have upset Mileva. She quit Zurich and moved to Heidelberg where she attended the course without taking exams. She studied the Kinetic Theory of Gases and wrote to Einstein apprising him the progress in her learning. A trace of romance was not absent in the letters the two exchanged. Einstein craved for her companionship. Within a year he convinced her to return to Zurich. </P>
          <P>As she had been away for a year, Mileva had quite a bit of catching up to do. Einstein offered to help her. Grossmann’s notes proved very useful. Textbooks were shared. She started living in an apartment close to Einstein’s. As was Einstein’s habit, he misplaced his house keys and had to stay out of his apartment. The easiest solution was to study in Mileva’s apartment. On the next occasion, the key was not lost, but Einstein preferred to study in her room. She did not object! What happened next is easy to guess. Their friendship grew deeper than a mere collaboration. Their letters were now filled with romantic content. </P>
          <P>During July 1900, the summer of his fourth year at the polytechnic, Einstein holidayed with his mother and sister at Hotel Paradise in a place called Melchtal near Zurich. During this period he devoted the first half of the day to studies, and played the violin in the afternoons; his mother’s friends were his audience. Einstein’s mother was pleased with the appreciation that he received. But she was unhappy that her son courted Mileva. Cleverly, Einstein used his violin to console his mother and encourage her to accept Mileva. He tried a similar trick with his father. He visited Hermann in Milan and toured his works. His father’s business was steadily improving now. </P>
          <P>It was during this holiday that Einstein’s mother discovered that the relationship between her son and Mileva had grown very strong and was on the brink of the next logical step. She also learnt that her son called her Dollie. When she asked Einstein, “What will become of your Dollie now?” he had answered, “My wife”. His mother threw herself on the bed, buried her head in the pillow and wept like a child. Then she cautioned, “You are ruining your future and destroying your opportunities.” Such advice continued all through the holiday. “Like you, she is a book; but you ought to have a wife.” “She is 24, you are 21. By the time you are 30, she will be an old witch.” His father opined that a relationship could become meaningful only when the man could afford a decent living. </P>
          <P>During his holidays, Einstein was determined to study the motion of earth through ether. It was believed that all space including the earth’s atmosphere was filled with a substance called ether, which, however, was disproved later. He also tried to consolidate everything he had learnt in physics. </P>
          <P>Einstein had to write two examinations for his diploma. He stood first in one exam with a score of 5.7 out of 6, while Grossmann obtained 5.6. The second was scored on the basis of a thesis. Einstein wanted to further research the motion of earth through ether. His idea was to reflect a beam of light in two directions; one, along earth’s motion and the other, perpendicular to the direction of the earth’s motion. He wanted to record the speed of light in both cases. If ether existed, the two speeds would be different. Prof. Weber, who was to approve and grade the thesis, did not like the topic. There may also have been a lapse on Einstein’s part. Two American scientists, Michelson and Morley, had already performed such an experiment and concluded that the speed of light remained the same in both the cases; there was no evidence to prove the presence of ether. </P>
          <P>Einstein put forth a different proposal; to study the conduction of heat and electricity in metals. Weber dismissed this idea as well. Einstein ended up performing an experiment on heat conduction. Mileva too had chosen the same topic. Einstein and Mileva scored 4.5 and 4 respectively, the lowest grades in class. Grossmann scored 5.5. Einstein’s thesis was rejected on the grounds that it was not written on the specified quality of paper. He had to copy his writing onto the specified type of paper.</P>
          <P>For his overall performance Einstein obtained 4.9 and stood fourth in class. So he graduated with a diploma in 1900. Mileva was not lucky. She had to repeat the year, as she had obtained a score of only 4 and had failed in astronomy and mathematics. </P>
          <P>Einstein applied for Swiss citizenship. The Swiss authorities scrutinised his records thoroughly, including information about his parents. His application was accepted. Einstein retained the Swiss nationality status though he later obtained citizenship of other countries. Now there was no escape; he had to offer himself for military service with the Swiss army. However, a medical examination revealed that he had flat, sweaty feet and varicose veins. He was rejected, and wasn’t he relieved! </P>

          <P>Hunt For A Job</P>
          <P>Initially, Einstein also had to job hunt; after all, he was not famous yet. A diploma was in his pocket. What next? - was the question. This to a certain extent had already been answered. He had chosen physics as his subject for study and an academic life was the only answer. He aimed to obtain a Ph.D. and seek the position of a junior professor in a university and climb the academic ladder. </P>
          <P>However, getting a job proved difficult for Einstein because of the reputation he had created for himself among the community of his polytechnic Professors. The standard procedure to apply for an academic position included furnishing recommendations and references from Professors with whom the candidate has worked. Add to this, a list of publications. No professor was even remotely inclined to give a recommendation or a reference. Einstein realized the futility of requesting Prof. Weber, who was his supervisor. Prof. Pernet was also out of question. Einstein considered Prof. Hurwitz who taught mathematics. But he had slipped out of his lectures too! A job seeking student had to meet his professor and formally request him for a recommendation. But, Einstein decided to write to Hurwitz. The letter was naïve, stating that he had missed Hurwitz’s mathematics lectures because he had liked physics more. Having stated thus, he still hoped for a reply! Of course Hurwitz did not respond. Thus, Einstein was the only one in class who was still looking for a placement despite obtaining a diploma from the Zurich Polytechnic. It is interesting to note that Weber hired two engineering students as his assistants, totally ignoring Einstein. Apparently, he had also convinced many other Professors to reject Einstein. As one of his friends has observed, “His sharp tongue and the fact that he was Jew,” may have been the other reasons.</P>
          <P>Einstein was twenty one. His allowance from his relatives had stopped. A job was imperative to support himself and to marry Mileva. He was looking for a job as an assistant to a professor, so that he could also undertake to do a Ph.D. with him. There seemed no way out. Einstein found himself doing odd jobs such as tutoring, helping others with their calculations and occasional teaching jobs in schools to earn a livelihood. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s thought process however was very active. He wrote a paper on Capillary Action and published it in the reputed German Journal Annalen der Physik. He hoped it would attract the attention of important Professors; however, they were rather autocratic in those days and were not very approachable. Fully aware of this, Einstein sent a copy to Prof. Wilhelm Ostwald of the University of Leipzig, a forerunner in the area of physical chemistry and a Nobel Prize recipient. As can be expected, he received no reply. Einstein sent him reminders, but in vain. When his father Hermann discovered his son’s agony, he wrote to Prof. Ostwald begging for help. A reply did arrive, but with no offer of an appointment. Ironically enough, it was Prof. Ostwald who nominated Einstein for the Nobel Prize nine years later! Einstein tried his luck with Prof. Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes of Netherlands, but in vain. In any case, Einstein himself later dismissed this paper as worthless. </P>
          <P>Einstein had bought many reply-paid post cards. He sent one such post card and a copy of his paper, with every request he made. Though he received no replies, these cards are now exhibited in museums and are protected as collectors’ items. He wrote to Professors in places as remote as Italy. He jokingly remarked, “I will have soon graced every physicist from North Sea to the southern tip of Italy with my offer.” He would not give up. He said, “I leave no stone unturned and do not give up my sense of humour. God created the donkey and gave him a thick skin.”</P>
          <P>Einstein’s close friend Michele Angelo Besso from Italy tried to help him. But nothing came out of it. </P>
          <P>His passion for music did not wane, nor did his pursuit of physics. But his inability to gain employment depressed him and a sense of worthlessness engulfed him.</P>
          <P>Marcel Grossmann, who had once helped Einstein by offering his notes, came to his rescue again. Grossmann sought help from his father, an influential man, who at once recommended Einstein to meet Haller, the Director of the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. </P>
          <P>The meeting, almost an interview, between Einstein and Haller lasted more than two hours. Einstein was not equipped for this job; he had none of the technical skills. The conversation must have turned to physics at some point, which was to Einstein’s advantage. Haller was thrilled that Einstein was already a master of James Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory and immediately offered him a position. However, there was no vacancy and by law it had to be advertised. So Einstein had to wait. </P>
          <P>In the meantime, Einstein worked as a substitute teacher. He also tutored a few private students. Remarkably, working as a teacher in a technical school at Winterthur, he wrote a paper on thermodynamics which was later accepted by the journal Annalen der Physik. He submitted the same for a doctorate at the University of Zurich, which was turned down by Professor Alfred Kleiner. Einstein had made bold statements in the thesis and had challenged well-known scientists such as Boltzmann and Drude. Kleiner respected these two scientists and hence did not approve of Einstein challenging them. However, even this notable work is secondary compared to Einstein’s future contributions. </P>
          <P>“The candidates need not have a doctorate. But they must have mechanical training and also know physics,” said the newspaper advertisement from the patent office in December, 1901. No doubt it was specially tailored for Einstein. Needless to say, he did apply and was appointed as an engineer, third class. He immediately moved to Bern. But he had to wait for six months before he could take up this position. He continued his tutoring jobs. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s Daughter</P>
          <P>It was during this period that one of the lesser known events in Einstein’s life occurred. It came to light only in 1986. A daughter was born to Mileva and Einstein. Mileva delivered at her parent’s place in Novi Sad in early 1902 and the baby was named Lieserl. A child born out of wedlock was not uncommon in Europe those days. There is no record to tell us whether Einstein saw his daughter at all. There is no mention of her in any of his statements or conversations. However, scholars have found letters he wrote to Mileva, eagerly enquiring about Lieserl. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s parents Hermann and Pauline never thought that they would have a granddaughter this way. They expected Albert to marry Mileva. Pauline was totally against it and would do anything to prevent it. She even wrote to Mileva’s parents denouncing the possible marriage. </P>
          <P>Mileva never brought Lieserl to live with her and Einstein, even though he had elaborate plans for a big house for the three of them. She felt that it was not wise for a Swiss civil servant to live with a woman he is not married to, and a child. She would rather wait for Einstein to marry her. They did get married soon, but Lieserl remained in the background. Apparently she was raised by Helene Kaufler Savic, Mileva’s friend. </P>
          <P>A Job at Last </P>
          <P>June 23, 1902. It was a great day in Einstein’s life. He was finally employed! He started work at the patent office. He was called a Technical Expert, third class, with a salary of 3500 Swiss francs a year. The salary was reasonable; a junior professor in the university earned less.</P>
          <P>His office was situated where the Post and Telegraph office is situated today, in the old part of Bern near the historic clock erected in 1191 that the city still boasts of. Einstein passed by it every day on his way to work. The clock served as a time keeper for the trains that went through the Bern Train Station located nearby. </P>
          <P>His daily routine was to work from 8 am for 8 hours. Patents were submitted for approval. Einstein was in charge of investigating the applications. His boss Haller had suggested that Einstein be meticulous and cautious and assume at the outset that every inventor was lying!</P>
          <P>In reality, this work did not require 8 hours of his attention every day. He was able to finish his daily schedule in two or three hours. The rest of the day was dedicated to physics. He was able to think and involve himself in scientific study and work on his calculations. When he heard footsteps he would just hide the papers. In fact, Haller was aware of it and would laugh it away. </P>
          <P>The nature of work seemed well suited to him. Among others, were applications to patent methods for synchronising clocks and coordinating time using signals which travelled at the speed of light. We will soon see that time and light and its speed play a very important role in Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Einstein began to like his office. He could concentrate on his research without being forced into it. Here, he was under no pressure to write papers, in sharp contrast with university discipline, where Professors had to write as many papers as possible in a year, forcing them to publish sub-standard papers just to fulfil requirements. “An academic career in which a person is forced to produce scientific writings in great amounts creates a danger of intellectual superficiality,” Einstein would say. </P>
          <P>The Academy </P>
          <P>By Easter of 1902, Einstein offered to tutor students in his spare time and accordingly placed an advertisement in the newspapers – </P>
          <P>"Private Lessons in</P>
          <P>MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS</P>
          <P>for students and pupils</P>
          <P>given most thoroughly by</P>
          <P>ALBERT EINSTEIN, holder of the fed.</P>
          <P>Polyt. Teacher’s diploma,</P>
          <P>GERECHTIGKEITSGASSE 32, 1st FLOOR,</P>
          <P>Trial lessons free.”</P>
          <P>This ad attracted Maurice Solovine, a Romanian studying philosophy at the University of Bern. He had not yet decided whether to continue with philosophy or change to physics. He thought of seeking Einstein’s help. The two met for the first time in Einstein’s house. Solovine was very impressed by his large eyes. The two talked for nearly two hours, and continued the conversation for another half hour walking down a quiet street. By the third meeting, Einstein had decided that Solovine did not need any tutoring in physics. He invited Solovine to join him in his study of some of the works of great thinkers. They were no more student and teacher; they were colleagues. </P>
          <P>Conrad Habicht, a former student of mathematics at the Zurich Polytechnic was the next to join them. The trio called themselves the ‘Olympia Academy’. Einstein, though the youngest, was chosen the president. They even came up with a certificate with a dedication. The three made good company. On the occasion of his seventy-fourth birthday, Einstein paid rich tribute to their friendship in his speech. </P>
          <P>The Academy met mostly at Einstein’s apartment and occasionally at Solovine’s or Habicht’s house. The meeting was followed by dinner, usually consisting of sausage, cheese, fruits and tea. An exception was made for the president’s (Einstein) birthday when a large amount of caviar was bought. After dinner and discussion, Einstein would play his violin. The meetings ran well into the night much to the annoyance of the neighbours. The three particularly liked to go to the mountains near Bern in summer. They would watch the sunrise from the top of the mountains, wait for coffee shops to open and after a strong cup of black coffee, they would head for work.</P>
          <P>Once, Solovine wanted to attend a violin concert and hence could not be present for the meeting of the Academy at his own house. Being the host, he cooked eggs for his guests and left a note on the table, “Hard boiled eggs and a salutation.” Einstein and Habicht met as usual and decided to take revenge on Solovine for his absence. Solovine did not like smoking. The two smoked their pipes to their hearts’ content and dropped ashes everywhere in the apartment and left a note, “Thick smoke and a salutation!” </P>
          <P>It should not be construed that the Academy was interested only in physics or science. Its interests were varied. The three together read literary masterpieces including the Greek play Antigone by Sophocles, and Don Quixote by Cervantes; many philosophical works including David Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature, Ernst Mach’s Analysis of Sensations, Mechanics and Its Development, Baruch Spinoza’s Ethics and Henri Poincare’s Science and Hypothesis. </P>
          <P>Hume is sceptical about any knowledge other than that which can be perceived through sense organs. Even causality, the study of the relationship between cause and effect, is questionable. According to him, we perceive time only through a succession of ideas and impressions. Time on its own does not exist. Hume’s perceptions echo the fundamentals of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Kant was not new to Einstein. In fact, he had read Kant in his school days. Kant talks about two types of truths--Analytic and Synthetic. Three times seven is twenty one is an Analytic truth. On the other hand, Synthetic truth is observation-based. Bangalore is bigger than Mysore is an example. Einstein in the coming years dismissed this classification. For example, the fact that the sum of three angles of a triangle is 180° is true only in Euclidian geometry. In curved space the answer is different. So it is not an Analytic truth. </P>
          <P>According to Mach, concepts have meaning only if objects to which they refer and the rules by which they are assigned to these objects are discernable. This calls for an operational definition of any concept and an explanation of how to observe it in operation. Mach found that it was impossible to define concepts of absolute space and absolute time like Newton. </P>
          <P>Spinoza believed in a God reflected in beauty, order and unity of nature’s laws. Einstein liked his concept of a God who neither punishes human beings for their mistakes and sins nor rewards them for righteous acts. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s scientific philosophy was shaped through such meetings and discussions. However, it was fun that kept the Academy going. Unfortunately, it was short lived. Habicht left Bern in 1904 to become a school teacher in Schaffhausen in Swiss. Solovine left the year after and settled down in Paris to work as editor and writer. He later undertook to translate Einstein’s works into French. </P>
          <P>Einstein weds</P>
          <P>Einstein had a job which fetched him a good income. Marriage seemed to be the next obvious step.</P>
          <P>By October 1902, Einstein’s father Hermann’s health was failing. One day the entire family including Albert assembled near his bedside. But Hermann ordered everyone out before dying. Einstein was upset even though he had only a weak bond with his father. He said that his father’s death was the deepest shock he ever experienced. But there was something to be happy about. On his deathbed, Hermann gave Albert the permission to marry Mileva. </P>
          <P>The wedding of Albert Einstein and Mileva Marić was solemnised on January 6, 1903 at the registrar’s office in Bern with Solovine and Habicht as witnesses. It was an Academy affair. None of Einstein’s or Mileva’s relatives were present. The wedding party was a dinner at a nearby restaurant in the evening. Thereafter, the newlyweds went to Einstein’s apartment only to discover that he had forgotten his key (surely, not for the first time). The landlady had to be woken up. </P>
          <P>Now that he was married, Einstein was supremely happy. He wrote to Besso, “Well, now I am a married man and I am living a pleasant cosy life with my wife. …. She takes excellent care of everything, cooks well, and is always cheerful.”</P>
          <P>This turns out to be the declarations of a newly married, exuberant young man. We find that the joy was short lived. As the couple began to settle down, Mileva was absorbed in house work and found no time for her studies. She became a silent spectator at the Academy and also distrustful of Einstein at times. Einstein would recall later that he had an inner resistance which urged him not to marry her, but he had done so as a sense of duty. </P>
          <P>There were many differences between them. First of all, Mileva was not happy that Einstein was a public civil servant. She wanted him to be an academic and engage in research. If that was not possible, she wished he taught at some school. If not Switzerland, he could do so in her country, maybe in Belgrade. Then there was bad news. Their daughter Lieserl, then 19 months old, fell ill with scarlet fever. Mileva rushed to her hometown. Little is known about the poor child. It is believed that she was given up for adoption but no records are available to prove it. </P>
          <P>Curiously enough, all the letters in this regard exchanged between Einstein and Mileva and those between Mileva and the caretaker Savic have been destroyed. It is believed that Lieserl was alive in 1903 and may have been adopted by Savic herself. In any case, Mileva lived all her life with this secret hidden inside her. She never spoke about it even though she was advised by friends to doso. </P>
          <P>The time to get over Lieserl came very quickly. Mileva gave birth to a boy on May 14, 1904. He was named Hans Albert Einstein. A joyous Einstein assumed a paternal role looking after his son. He made toys using matchboxes and string. “He could make the most beautiful things,” recollects Hans. </P>
          <P>Mileva’s father Milos Marić was thrilled to learn that he was now grandfather to a boy. He rushed to Bern to visit the child. He offered a dowry of 100,000 francs to Einstein who refused it saying, “I did not marry your daughter for money.” Einstein, no longer on probation, was financially more secure. </P>
          <P>His enquiry into physics never stopped. In the hustle and bustle of life as a married man, Einstein wrote another paper, his third, which was published in Annalen der Physik. Subsequently he wrote a fourth paper. By now Einstein had set high standards in research. He was determined to become a privatdozent (one who pursues an academic career holding all the qualifications to become a professor). His fourth as well as fifth papers were published in the same journal. Some of the patent applications that Einstein examined were trying to promote perpetual motion machines. He knew very well that they would not work because they violated the second law of thermodynamics. To improve his knowledge of the subject, he studied the contributions of Boltzmann and Gibbs in the field of thermodynamics. And he went beyond them. This formed the theme for his next papers.</P>

          <P>The Miracle Year -Annus Mirabilis</P>
          <P>In the life-time of a scientist, the age between twenty-four and twenty-six is often seen as a period of exceptional intellectual achievement. There can be no better examples than those of Einstein and Newton. Isaac Newton in 1666, at the age of twenty-four made his mark in physics, by formulating the Law of Gravity, inventing calculus and exploring optics, and thus changed the course of physics. The year 1666 has been called Newton’s Annus Mirabilis. Einstein’s Annus Mirabilis was 1905. </P>
          <P>In May 1905 Einstein wrote a letter to his friend and a fellow Olympian which read thus: </P>
          <P>
            <em>“Dear Habicht!</em>
          </P>
          <P>
            <em>…… I promise you four papers in return. The first deals with </em>
            <em>radiation and energy properties of light and is very revolutionary, </em>
            <em>as you will see if you send me your work first. The second paper is a </em>
            <em>determination of the true size of atoms. The third proves that bodies </em>
            <em>on the order of magnitude 1/1000 mm suspended in liquids must </em>
            <em>already perform an observable random motion that is produced by </em>
            <em>thermal motion. Such movement of suspended bodies has actually </em>
            <em>been observed by physiologists who call it Brownian Motion. </em>
          </P>
          <P>The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and is on electrodynamics of moving bodies, which employs a modification of the theory of space and time; the purely kinematic part of this paper will surely interest you. </P>
          <P>The first paper dealing with Photoelectric Effect fetched him the Nobel Prize (not his work on Relativity, as is popularly believed). When light impinges on a metallic surface, electrons are knocked off and an electric current can be generated by connecting the metallic surface to a circuit. This phenomenon is called the Photoelectric Effect. It was a known fact that on heating, an object released small packets or chunks of energy called Quanta. Einstein proved that this is also true of light waves and called this paper, ‘On a heuristic point of view Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light’. What is significant is the use of the word heuristic (meaning that which is not rigorously proved), implying his reservations with the concept of quanta. Nevertheless, an entire discipline of study called Quantum Mechanics came into existence. Einstein was never comfortable with this subject and battled with its supporters all his life. Even in the last of his papers, Einstein maintained the same stand on the subject. Ironically, it was his own theory that gave rise to quantum mechanics. </P>
          <P>Even after the publication of his revolutionary paper which won him a Nobel Prize, he was only Mr Einstein; he had no doctorate. Embarking on it, he prepared a dissertation and submitted it to the University of Zurich and also as a paper to the journal, Annalen der Physik. The paper was titled, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions. Unlike his previous papers, he made sure that he was on safe ground and avoided all controversy. He was awarded a doctorate for this work and he became Dr. Einstein. </P>
          <P>That fourth paper wherein he introduced The Special Theory of Relativity was of interest not just to Habicht but to the entire world. Scientists including Newton till then had accepted the concepts of space and time to be absolute entities. What are ten seconds for one individual are ten seconds for everyone. So are ten metres, for example. Einstein debunked this notion and proposed that the perception of time and space was dependent upon the relative speed between the observer and the object. He explained that at low speeds, the differences between what is observed by a stationary observer and a moving observer were negligible; but at speeds comparable to that of light, the difference was enormous leading to phenomena such as Length Contraction, Time Dilation and Twin Paradox among others. These phenomena have been briefly dealt with in Part 2 of the book. It is worth mentioning here that according to Einstein the speed of light is the maximum one can hope to achieve. In other words nothing can travel faster than light. Only a man who is not entangled in the shallow plane of common sense can deduce that space and time are relative and that some of our common experiences may feel different at high speeds. Thus, Einstein’s theory disturbed certain fundamental notions of perception. </P>
          <P>E=mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN></P>
          <P>E=mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> has become synonymous with Albert Einstein. In this equation, E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. It is amazing that in his miracle year, 1905, he formulated not just the Special Theory of Relativity but also deduced that mass and energy are equivalent. He presented it to the scientific community in a paper entitled Does the Inertia of a Body depend on its Energy Content?' The paper was published on 27<SPAN><Sup>th</Sup></SPAN> of September, in Annalen der Physik. It is as revolutionary as his Theory of Relativity. Unfortunately, it is also the paper that led to Einstein being wrongly and unfairly identified as the father of the atomic bomb. </P>
          <P>The significance of this equation is that mass and energy are associated with each other. When we say that mass is m, it is automatically associated with an x amount of energy calculated by mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>. At the same time, a given amount of energy is always associated with a certain amount of mass. When we gift someone an object weighing a kilogram, we are gifting 25 billion kilowatt hours of energy! A small raisin could supply the energy needs of New York for a day! An electric bulb that radiates 100 watts for 100 years uses less than 1/3000 gm of mass.</P>
          <P>It seemed as if all his knowledge and ingenuity was simmering beneath the surface to suddenly erupt into concrete theories and the result was four papers presenting discoveries which caused unprecedented breakthroughs in science. A clerk in the patent office, working after-hours, produces such phenomenal work! All in a single year! Well, that is the genius of Einstein!</P>
          <P>Please refer Part 2 of the book for a discussion of Einstein’s papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>How did the theory come about?</P>
          <P>Scientists and laymen alike have been curious about the process by which the Theory of Relativity came about. What were its sources and inspiration? What was Einstein doing in the final hours leading to the epiphany? What was the struggle preceding the ultimate discovery? Unfortunately there is nothing recorded for posterity. The only source we have is Einstein’s 1922 speech in Japan.</P>
          <P>We understand that it was a wonderful day. He had spent the afternoon with his friend Besso. Einstein was stuck at a critical juncture in his theory formulation and found it impossible to proceed. The night was typical--cigars, pipes and conversation. Of course, he scribbled on the back of letters, bills and random pieces of paper, as was his custom. His conversation with Besso must have triggered something. In retrospect, he has said, “Suddenly I understood where to find the key to this problem.” The next day he rushed to Besso and shouted out, “Thank you; I have completely solved my problem.” Apart from this we have no indication whatever of the driving forces behind Einstein’s theory. Where did he start? What were the steps he took? We can at best only guess and try to reconstruct the way he arrived at the theory. We should not forget that Einstein as a young boy was fascinated with the compass and obsessed with the speed of light. These may have influenced his thinking. </P>
          <P>There is also a school of thought that believes that Henri Poincare had actually developed the Theory of Relativity in 1904. It is also believed that though Einstein was aware of it, he never acknowledged it. The paper by Poincare does anticipate ideas that form Einstein’s theory. But it is held that he was not bold enough to propose the theory as Einstein did. </P>
          <P>Did Mileva help Einstein develop the theory?</P>
          <P>Mileva and Einstein as we know had graduated from the same institution and had acquired the same diploma. She too had studied physics and mathematics. There has been some speculation as to whether Mileva and Einstein had worked together on the Theory of Relativity. To substantiate this claim, a letter written by Einstein to Mileva is often quoted – “How happy and proud I will be when the two of us will have brought our work on relative motion to a conclusion.” In a letter to his friend Habicht, he says that the two were dead drunk under the table when the work was finished. In fact, Einstein has praised his wife for help with mathematics. Add to this the rumour that the first draft of the Relativity paper had Mileva’s name as co-author. </P>
          <P>This issue has been discussed in a few conferences. Of course, the media has taken it up seriously. An impressive television documentary compels us to believe that Mileva was an active collaborator. It has however been pointed out that Mileva never claimed her participation even after their marriage broke down. Their son Hans Albert has stated that Mileva did help his father with his mathematical work, but no creative idea originated in her. </P>

          <P>Professor at Last</P>
          <P>His doctorate helped Einstein secure a promotion in the patent office. He became a technical expert, second class; his salary increased to 4500 francs. </P>
          <P>Einstein expected that there would be a stream of letters and comments about his theory in the journals. But surprisingly nobody seemed to care. However, one person of repute did; Max Planck, a leading physicist of the time. Though he had dismissed the concept of light quanta proposed byEinstein, he now accepted the Theory and also propagated it among his friends.. When Einstein received a letter of appreciation from Planck he felt greatly relieved. Planck further developed the theory and published papers about it in 1906 and 1907. </P>
          <P>Following Planck’s recommendation, one of his assistants, Max von Laue, sought an appointment with Einstein. When he arrived in Bern, Laue was astonished to learn that Einstein was not a professor at the University of Bern but a clerk in a government office. When Laue arrived at the patent office to meet Einstein, there was another surprise awaiting him. Laue did not recognise the shirt sleeved unassuming man who walked past him as Einstein. Only after he walked past the reception area a few times, did Laue recognise the father of the Theory of Relativity. The two had a long discussion. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. In 1911, Laue wrote the first ever book on Relativity. In 1914, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals.</P>
          <P>Einstein did not relax even after so many ground breaking publications. In 1906, he wrote another paper on Brownian Motion. In 1907, he completed his formulation of equivalence of mass and energy, namely, the paper on the formula E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>. In this paper he laid the foundation for another masterpiece, the General Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Hermann Minkowski, Professor of Mathematics at the Zurich Polytechnic remembered that he had called Einstein a lazy dog. In December 1907, Minkowski presented a brilliant paper on Relativity at Gottingen University. The teacher had followed the student.</P>
          <P>This is not to say that the Theory of Relativity was received with open arms everywhere. There were cries of dissent. Most people found it difficult to grasp and appreciate. New ideas about space and time were just not acceptable. The rejection came not only from physicists; philosophers and laymen also joined. </P>
          <P>Einstein was pained by the fact that he was still a government officer carrying out mundane duties. He wished he was researching at a university. Towards the end of 1907, he sought the position of a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. This was the lowest academic position in any German university and apprenticeship to become a professor. Einstein sent copies of all seventeen research papers that he had written along with the application. He was also required to submit an unpublished paper as a Habilitation Thesis, as it was called. Einstein assumed that he would be excused from sending an unpublished paper, given his brilliant publication record. Only one member from the selection committee supported Einstein’s view. The rest demanded that he write a habilitation thesis. Einstein refused to do so and was not selected. It is also stated that Einstein submitted his 1905 paper on Relativity as his habilitation thesis. The paper was rejected by the committee on grounds that it was incomprehensible. </P>
          <P>Einstein was naturally upset. One wonders whether a person of Einstein’s calibre should have suffered such humiliation. However, we should realise that he was still not famous. His theory had had only a limited exposure. Einstein wrote a letter to Marcel Grossmann with whom he had studied at Zurich Polytechnic and who was now a professor of mathematics there. He begged his friend to advise him regarding a position at a technical school at Winterthur. Could he meet somebody responsible for selecting staff and try to impress upon him that Einstein was a worthy choice? He also applied for the position of a mathematics teacher at the Zurich Canton Gymnasium. In his application he mentioned that he could also teach physics. There were 21 applicants; he did not make it to the shortlist of three candidates! </P>
          <P>Luck did favour Einstein at last. He received a postcard from Professor Alfred Kleiner, who had rejected and later accepted his thesis at the Zurich University. It was his wish to appoint Einstein as a professor at his university. He advised Einstein to pursue the position of a privatdozent in Bern and to report any developments. Einstein did so and also submitted a habilitation thesis which was an extension to his work on photoelectric effect. There was no opposition to his appointment; in 1908 Einstein became a privatdozent at the University of Bern. </P>
          <P>The job was not particularly attractive. First of all it did not pay him a salary. The only monetary benefit was in the form of tips the students gave. There were only three or four students. This job was in addition to his duties at the patent office. Being a privatdozent seemed a burden; but it had to be borne if he wanted to become a professor. </P>
          <P>In 1908, he started lecturing on the Theory of Heat to a class of three students comprising his friend Besso, and his colleagues from the patent office, Schenk and Chavan. He lectured twice a week at 7am, on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Einstein had just enough time to reach his workplace after the lecture. In winter, he taught the Theory of Radiation when he had an additional student, Stern. By the summer of 1909, Stern was the only student in class. The course was cancelled. </P>
          <P>Einstein was hardly a good lecturer. Moreover, his attire was awful. He resembled a typical Russian refugee of those days. There were many Russian Jews in Germany who were, “poor, ill-clad, unkempt and therefore frowned upon.” </P>
          <P>His sister Maja was a student at the same university. She wanted to listen to one of his lectures so she enquired the doorman about the room where he lectured. She was smartly dressed. The doorman was surprised and asked, “What ….. that Russian is your brother?” </P>
          <P>Yet Kleiner persisted in his efforts to make Einstein a professor. He persuaded the University of Zurich to create the position of Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics, which, he said would enhance the prestige of the university. There was an obstacle. Friedrich Adler, a close friend of Einstein, sought the same position. The counsellor of the university had, in fact, urged his nomination. Adler, the son of the founder and leader of the Austrian Democratic Party, was more tuned to politics than to theoretical physics. The two candidates met and decided that it was Einstein who deserved the position. Alder withdrew his application.</P>
          <P>At this juncture, Kleiner made a surprise visit to one of Einstein’s lectures in Bern, probably at the request of the selection committee in Zurich. He expressed his dissatisfaction with Einstein’s lecturing skills and Einstein replied, “I certainly don’t demand to be made a university professor at Zurich.” Kleiner reported to the University of Zurich thus; “Einstein holds monologues and is far away from becoming a teacher”. To make matters worse Kleiner’s comments were circulated among the staff at the university. Einstein was beginning to feel that a university position was becoming a mirage. </P>
          <P>To improve his chances Einstein volunteered to give a talk at the Physics Society in Zurich. The lecture was delivered after meticulous preparation. Kleiner was now impressed and promised to recommend Einstein for the position. He wrote a very strong letter of support to the university that read thus:</P>
          <P>“Einstein ranks as one of the most important theoretical physicists. He has been recognised as one such following his publication of the Theory of Relativity. He will prove his worth as a teacher.” </P>
          <P>The faculty met in secret. Einstein’s Jewish descent was the next hurdle. But Kleiner came to his rescue and commented that there was nothing peculiar about him even though he was a Jew. The faculty was convinced. Einstein was appointed an Associate Professor with ten votes in favour and one abstention. However, he was disappointed to discover that the salary offered was lower than what he earned at the patent office. He rejected the offer. Soon the university made a better offer and Einstein accepted it. </P>
          <P>During his last days at the patent office he received an attractive large envelope. As usual Einstein did not open it and threw it into the waste paper basket. It was an invitation from the University of Geneva to receive an honorary doctorate. The authorities persuaded him through one of his friends to accept the offer. </P>
          <P>He submitted his resignation letter to the patent office on July 6, 1909, effective from October 15. It was not easy to leave that office, “where I hatched my most beautiful ideas and where we had such good times together”, he told Besso.</P>

          <P>Zurich</P>
          <P>Zurich was not new to the Einstein couple. It was the town where the two had spent their student days; they were happy to be back there. Besides, they had the company of good friends. Adler and his wife lived in an apartment close to the Einsteins. Einstein and Adler met regularly to discuss philosophy and physics in the attic of a building nearby, undisturbed by children and wives. </P>
          <P>Whenever Einstein needed help in geometry or calculus, he consulted his friend Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics at Zurich Polytechnic. Adolf Hurwitz, whose classes Einstein had skipped, was still there as a distinguished professor of mathematics. The two reunited not to discuss mathematics, but to perform music. Hurwitz held concerts at his house on Sundays. Einstein attended them regularly. He also helped Hurwitz’s daughter with her math homework. </P>
          <P>Einstein was very different from the German professors of those days. His lectures were as unique as his attire. He wore shabby trousers too short for him. Einstein did not lecture from meticulously prepared notes in the traditional style. He scribbled on small pieces of paper. His thoughts developed as he spoke, providing students the unique opportunity of watching the great master in action. He paused now and then to make sure students followed him and encouraged them to interrupt and ask questions; very unusual for a German professor of those times. Sometimes, Einstein converted the class into a discussion group, encouraging students to talk.</P>
          <P>After the formal classroom sessions, the meetings continued in Cafe Terrace. Discussions ended only when the cafe closed for the day. Many times these discussions resumed at his home. Once he discussed a paper by Max Planck with his students in his apartment. Students could find no mistake in it but Einstein could. Students suggested they should write to Planck drawing his attention to it. Einstein would not do so as he revered Planck. So, he said, “The result is correct; the mistake is in the proof. Let us send him the correct proof.” He had the rare insight to identify at once the physics that was hidden behind a given mathematical formula. For most people, a formula was an abstract entity.</P>
          <P>Einstein was about to complete his first year as an academic at Zurich when his second son Eduard was born in July 1910. Mileva was very sick following childbirth. It was suggested she hire a house maid to manage home chores. Her response was, “Isn’t it clear to anyone that my husband works himself half dead?” Instead of hiring a maid, she sought her mother’s help which was readily available. </P>
          <P>Indeed, Einstein’s first love was physics and many a time, family and friends fell far behind. His scientific engagement flowed like a dauntless river without caring for its banks. Yet he loved his children dearly. His son Hans has recalled that when his mother was busy around the house, father would put aside his work and watch them for hours, bouncing them on his knees. He would tell stories. He often played violin in an effort to keep them quiet. Nevertheless, at times, he was also capable of ignoring their cries and carrying on with his work. Tanner, a student, recalls that once when he had come to meet Einstein at home, he found him pouring over a pile of papers. He held Eduard in his left hand while writing with his right. Hans was playing and still sought attention. As soon as Einstein saw Tanner, he passed Eduard to him and continued scribbling equations. </P>
          <P>Prague</P>
          <P>Einstein was only an Associate Professor at Zurich. In March 1910, he was offered full professorship at the German part of University of Prague. During those days Prague was a part of the Austro Hungarian Empire. He had always hoped to become a full-fledged professor in some university. The opportunity finally presented itself. Soon the word spread across the University of Zurich. Fifteen students led by Tanner submitted a memorandum to the authorities demanding Einstein’s retention in Zurich and as Head of Theoretical Physics. According to them, Einstein had the amazing talent of presenting the most difficult problems of theoretical physics in a clear lucid style; that it was a great delight to follow his lectures; and that he was so good at establishing rapport with his audience. Giving into this demand, the authorities increased Einstein’s salary to 5500 francs a year. But Einstein was quite convinced about choosing professorship and did not stay back. </P>
          <P>It was not smooth sailing towards Prague. Max Planck had given a strong recommendation for Einstein. But there was a contender, Gustav Baumann, who had the benefit of being an Austrian and a non-Jew. But he was placed second in the shortlist of candidates. When he learnt of this, he fumed, unwilling to accept a position second to Einstein in the merit list.</P>
          <P>Religion also came in the way. Einstein was fond of saying that he belonged to no religion. But the emperor had mandated everyone in his empire to belong to a religion. To quieten the authorities Einstein declared that his religion was mosaic and agreed to accept Austro Hungarian citizenship. As a result he was appointed to the position at almost double the current salary. He was now a full Professor.</P>
          <P>Einstein felt that he should personally meet Mach and Lorentz, his heroes of science. He did so before leaving for Prague. Earlier, Mach and he had engaged in an intellectual battle about the existence of the atom. Einstein regarded Lorentz as a guru and went with Mileva to see him in Leiden, Holland where he lived. The two men met often during this trip. Einstein says, “Lorentz meant more to me personally than anybody else that I have met in my life.”</P>
          <P>Mileva hated the idea of moving to Prague. We do not know whether Einstein liked it or not, but he sure wanted the academic position. He seemed to have liked the people there, but Mileva complained of the city being dirty and the people being haughty. </P>
          <P>The family became acquainted with a lady called Bertha Fanta who was interested in music and literature and organised get-togethers for the Jews of Prague. Einstein met many intellectuals such as Franz Kafka (author of novels such as The Trial, The Castle among others) and Max Brod (author, composer and journalist). During these meetings Einstein discussed the philosophy of Immanuel Kant or played music. </P>
          <P>Paul Ehrenfest, a physicist from Vienna working in St. Petersburg in Russia, contacted Einstein and requested him to find him a suitable professional position. Einstein responded and invited him to Prague to spend a few days with him. When Ehrenfest arrived, Einstein and Mileva met him at the train station. Soon after Mileva left them and headed home, Einstein and Ehrenfest became absorbed in the discussion of physics. They established a good rapport. During the seven days that he stayed in Prague, Einstein updated him with the details of his General Theory of Relativity. Ehrenfest accompanied the Einstein family on the piano when they performed Brahms.</P>
          <P>Einstein was already contemplating on leaving Prague and was happy for Ehrenfest to take over his position. But the latter was reluctant to affiliate himself with any religion, even though it was one of the prerequisites to join the University of Prague. </P>
          <P>Meanwhile, Lorentz in Leiden was preparing for his retirement by cutting down on his lectures. A replacement was warranted. Einstein was approached as a possible candidate, but he refused. As a result, the position was offered to Ehrenfest. Thus, Einstein and Ehrenfest met often. In 1933, history took a new turn with Hitler coming to power.</P>
          <P>The Solvay Congress was a prestigious meeting place for physicists and scientists. A Belgian chemist and industrialist, Ernest Solvay, made an abundant amount of money by manufacturing soda. He was also interested in the theories of physics. To spend his money usefully he organised a meeting of leading physicists towards the end of 1911 at the Grand Hotel Metropole in Brussels. Twenty of the great physicists of the day participated. Hendrik Lorenz, Einstein, Marie Curie, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Walther Nernst, Wilhem Wien and Henri Poincare were the foremost among the delegates who met and discussed the Quantum Problem. </P>
          <P>At the Congress, Einstein insisted that light travels in small packets called quanta, which contradicted Maxwell’s theory. He faced intense opposition from Planck, Poincare and Lorentz. He confessed that the quantum hypothesis did violate Maxwell’s theory and that it was only a provisional hypothesis. </P>
          <P>Nothing positive came out of the Congress for Einstein except that it launched him as a leading physicist of Europe. He also met Marie Curie and Paul Langevin who became good friends. </P>
          <P>Elsa </P>
          <P>Mileva had hoped that she would be a scientist on par with her husband. As time passed and her domestic responsibilities increased, her ambition was forced to the back burner. She was reduced to being a housewife. Einstein made no effort to elevate her in any way. While in Prague, he gained recognition from several quarters. He travelled all over Europe propagating his theories. Mileva felt neglected. A family friend hinted that she had probably become schizophrenic; Einstein confessed that he thought so too. Their marriage was on the rocks.</P>
          <P>It was under these circumstances that Einstein met Elsa in Berlin during the Easter holidays of 1912. She was related to him both through his father and his mother, a cousin from both sides. She was not entirely new to him. The two had played together as kids in Munich. She was now aged 36, married and divorced, with two daughters, Margot and Ilse. </P>
          <P>Einstein was looking for a companion and it seemed to him that Elsa could provide everything Mileva could not. The two women were diametrically opposite in nature. Mileva was intelligent and complex, while Elsa was very conventional, pretty and caring. There was chemistry between Elsa and Einstein. Love bloomed. They began writing to each other. </P>
          <P>Einstein succumbed easily. In one of his letters, he wrote, “I have to have someone to love, otherwise life is miserable. And this someone is you.” </P>
          <P>Einstein’s surrender was so complete that he even considered moving to Berlin. An invitation or an opportunity was all he needed. </P>
          <P>His relationship with Mileva worsened after he returned to Prague. However, he was cautious and did not intend to break away from her at once. So, he wrote to Elsa saying that it was better if they did not correspond. </P>
          <P>Prague turned out to be an unsuitable place for Einstein and Mileva. They each developed their grievances. Water was bad; milk and air were unhealthy, especially for their second son Eduard, who lost his appetite as a consequence; the people of Prague were snobbish with no good will for others. In short, it was time to moveon.</P>
          <P>Back to Zurich</P>
          <P>Einstein was now a well-known physicist and could almost choose the place where he wanted to work. His friend, Grossmann, was trying his best, with the help of his colleagues, to get him back to Zurich. The Polytechnic, where he had worked before was now a university capable of awarding degrees.</P>
          <P>Einstein already had two offers, from Leiden and Utrecht. He rejected both, assured that the Zurich offer would come through. However, there was reluctance on the part of some officials in Zurich Polytechnic, who were not in favour of an exclusive chair for theoretical physics. One of Einstein’s friends, a medical researcher, Heinrich Zangger, advised the university that a faculty member for theoretical physics was a necessity and that it required no laboratory. This meant the university would not have to spend much money to maintain Einstein and his studies. He, along with Marie Curie and Poincare strongly recommended Einstein. </P>
          <P>Einstein was appointed with a salary of 10,000 francs per year and a bonus of 1000 francs. Incidentally Einstein had once failed the entrance examination at Zurich Polytechnic. He was back on the streets that he had strolled as a young man, the coffee clubs he had frequented and the country he had enjoyed. It was the place where he had met Mileva and and fallen in love with her. Now he was back in a familiar setting, he could settle down and continue with his research. </P>
          <P>The joy of moving back to Zurich was shared by Mileva and the children as well. The family rented a six bedroom apartment with magnificent views. Einstein was happy to be reunited with Grossmann and Zangger. Einstein was secretly relieved that Prof. Weber was now dead. Not that he would have interfered with Einstein in any way, if he were alive. </P>
          <P>His colleagues included Planck, Nernst, Haber and Freundlich with whom he had been corresponding all this while. Freundlich set himself to verify the General Theory of Relativity by measuring the deflection of a ray of light from a distant star. Later he was placed in charge of building the Einstein Tower near Potsdam in Berlin. </P>
          <P>Sunday afternoon concerts at the residence of Hurwitz continued. Now in the presence of the Einstein family, Mozart and Schumann became alive again.</P>
          <P>Contrary to expectations, Mileva’s health did not improve. She suffered from rheumatism. Either she stayed away from the concerts or remained aloof when she attended them. </P>
          <P>On the other hand, Elsa resumed writing to Einstein. She wanted to be with him somehow. On his thirty-fourth birthday he received a greeting from her. She requested him to suggest a good book on Relativity and to send her his picture. Einstein replied that there was no good book on Relativity he could suggest. He offered to take her on a long walk and explain Relativity himself. Besides, since he himself was going to appear before her, there was no need to send a picture, Eventually, he sent a picture of himself as requested. </P>
          <P>Einstein was not destined to stay in Zurich for long. A great opportunity came knocking on his door.</P>
          <P>Please come to Berlin</P>
          <P>On July 11, 1913, Einstein had two distinguished visitors, Max planck and Walther Nernst, who came with the attractive proposal of a position at the Pussian Academy of Sciences. He was also offered the directorship of the newly established Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Theoretical Physics and professorship at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin. These positions carried handsome salaries. At the same time, he would not be compelled to teach or carry out any administrative duties. A proposal too attractive to refuse! The only condition imposed was that he should accept German citizenship again while retaining his Swiss citizenship. </P>
          <P>Einstein did not accept the offer outright and asked for a few hours’ time to think about it. The two scientists had come with their wives and they decided to go to nearby Mount Rigi for an excursion. They hinted that by the time they returned, Einstein would have to make up his mind. Einstein indicated that he would meet them at the train station on their return. If he held a red rose it would mean that he had accepted the offer. A white rose meant refusal. When they returned there was a smiling Einstein holding a red rose!</P>
          <P>The Academy would not appoint Einstein at once. It sought opinion from the leading physicists of Germany about him. In reply they wrote, “There is no great problem in modern physics to which Einstein has not made a significant contribution.” Indeed, a great praise to be bestowed upon a contemporary scientist. Einstein, on the other hand, though publishing papers ceaselessly, wondered whether he could always lay a golden egg. He was appointed with twenty one votes in favour and one abstention, and was awarded a salary of 12,000 marks a year. </P>
          <P>Einstein was wondering if it was wise to leave Zurich, considering that his family and he had well-adjusted to the city. Besides, he now had to embrace German citizenship which he had thrown away only a few years before. </P>
          <P>Historians have discussed the pros and cons of Einstein’s move to Berlin. But one factor outweighed all other considerations--Elsa. Einstein saw this as a golden opportunity to unite with her and have a much better family life. He told one of his friends, “She was the main reason for my going to Berlin.” What lends support to this belief is that Einstein wrote a letter to Elsa, immediately after Planck and Nernst left him. He wrote, “I will be coming over to Berlin by spring next year. I am already enjoying the lovely hours we can have together.” </P>
          <P>What goes on behind the scene is always very interesting. Elsa put in a word through the industrialist Fritz Haber, a Nobel laureate who had discovered a process to synthesise ammonia and ran the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry. “Einstein will accept the position if offered”. One cannot be sure whether this really mattered, for it appears, Einstein would have been appointed anyway. </P>
          <P>Elsa already assumed she was married to Einstein and started advising him on matters of diet and exercise. He, for his part, did not hide his feelings--he longed to be with her soon. At the same time he cautioned Elsa that he was not prepared to abandon his wife Mileva.</P>
          <P>In August 1913, Einstein planned a vacation with his family near Lake Como in Switzerland. Marie Curie and her daughters joined them. Einstein’s son Eduard fell sick, so Mileva made arrangements for him to be placed elsewhere. Following this the Einstein family went to Mileva’s parents’ place in Novi Sad. His children Hans and Eduard were baptised. He did not care whether his children were baptised or not. From here, after a short stay in Vienna, Einstein went to Berlin to be with Elsa. She was very clear in what she wanted--“Divorce Mileva and marry me”. Einstein was not ready for this.</P>
          <P>Mileva, as can be expected, hated the idea of moving to Berlin where there were three people she disliked--Elsa, Pauline (Einstein’s mother) and Maja (Einstein’s sister). But Elsa and the General Theory of Relativity were Einstein’s retreats. Before they moved to Berlin, Eduard developed an infection. Mileva had to take him to a resort in the Alps. Einstein, however, felt it necessary to go to Berlin to visit Elsa! He even skipped a conference in Paris to arrive a day earlier. </P>
          <P>Berlin</P>
          <P>Einstein moved to Berlin in April 1914. A large apartment had been selected by Mileva at the heart of the city. She joined him straight from the Alps after Eduard recovered. </P>
          <P>Einstein was busy at work. He had three jobs at hand, apart from the General Theory of Relativity he was working on. Einstein complained to Ehrenfest, when he visited, that family took too much of his time. Mileva was brooding that they should have remained in Zurich. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s attraction to Elsa increased; Mileva became a burden. He even requested his friends Besso, Zanggers and Haber to help in dissolving the marriage. While Einstein remained withdrawn from family and engrossed in work, Mileva felt totally disenchanted. Her dreams of becoming a scientist had melted. Her husband had become a star in physics. As retaliation, she started to hate anything or anybody connected with Einstein, his mother, sister and friends. </P>
          <P>The end came just two months after they settled in Berlin. Mileva took their children and moved away to Haber’s house. It was for Haber to act as a mediator between Einstein and Mileva in the days to follow. Einstein drew up a set of conditions for Mileva, if she wanted to live with him. The document ran as follows:</P>
          <P>Conditions</P>
          <P>A. You make sure</P>
          <P> 1. That my clothes and laundry are kept in good order and repair;</P>
          <P> 2. That I receive my three meals regularly <em>in my room</em>;</P>
          <P> 3. That my bedroom and office are always kept neat, in particular, that the desk is available <em>to me alone</em>;</P>
          <P>B. You renounce all personal relations with me as far as maintaining them is not absolutely required for social reasons. Specifically, you do without,</P>
          <P> 1. My sitting at home with you;</P>
          <P> 2. My going out or travelling with you;</P>
          <P>C. In your relation with me you commit yourself explicitly to adhering to the following points:</P>
          <P> 1. You are neither to expect intimacy from me nor to reproach me in any way;</P>
          <P> 2. You must desist immediately from addressing me, if I request it;</P>
          <P> 3. You must leave my bedroom or office immediately without protest if I so request;</P>
          <P>D. You commit yourself not to disparage me either in word or in deed in front of my children; </P>
          <P>One wonders whether Einstein was in the right frame of mind when he wrote these conditions. It reads like a statement of duties and manners for a secretary rather than requests to a wife. It is very clear that he valued himself and his work more than his family, children included. A wife meant nothing. She was there just to support him and manage his house. It is surprising that Mileva accepted these terms. Einstein went on to make sure that she clearly understood his conditions. </P>
          <P>As can be guessed, being no better than a ceasefire agreement between two rival countries, it did not work. The couple met in Haber’s house very soon on a Friday to formulate the terms of separation. In a meeting that lasted three hours, Einstein offered 5600 marks a year for Mileva to support herself and the children. A lawyer later finalised the deal. Einstein did not go to see the lawyer and deputed his friend Besso to represent him. He found it more fulfilling to go to Elsa’s house. But she was away in the Alps! As per the terms of agreement, Einstein was allowed access to his children at any place not connected with Elsa.</P>
          <P>Mileva decided to return to Zurich and left Berlin on the morning of July 29, 1914. Einstein saw her and his children off at the train station. The dormant paternal instinct surfaced and he wept like a child unable to bear the separation from his kids. Said he, “I have carried these children a number of times, I have taken them in prams and have played with them. They used to shout with joy when I came home. They are gone forever, and their image of their father is being spoiled.” </P>
          <P>Einstein’s mother Pauline felt happy that Mileva was out of the family and that her son, Albert, no longer had anything to do with her. She approved his relationship with Elsa. Elsa’s parents were pleased with the prospect of Einstein becoming their son-in-law. At the same time, they were not happy that he had given away a sizable portion of his salary to Mileva. Elsa renewed her request that Einstein and she get married. Again he declined. He seemed to detest the institution of marriage; to him it was not required. It meant some sort of confinement. </P>
          <P>In the middle of all this turmoil, Einstein continued to concentrate on his scientific pursuit. He was busy working on his General Theory of Relativity. Nothing can describe him better than the following lines from Oliver Goldsmith - </P>
          <P>As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,</P>
          <P>Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm, </P>
          <P>Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread, </P>
          <P>Eternal sunshine settles on its head.</P>
          <P>The First World War </P>
          <P>The First World War broke out in August 1914. Einstein and Mileva had separated only a few months before. Patriotism ignited the Germans. Cries of nationalism were heard everywhere. Scientists and the intelligentsia spoke openly and took sides. Einstein was opposed to the war. Like Bertrand Russell, British mathematician and philosopher, he hated the bloodthirstiness among the so called patriots. He believed in Internationalism which he had envisioned in Aarau, thanks to Winteler. </P>
          <P>His close friends and colleagues, Planck, Nernst and Haber were ready to cooperate with the German government and the army to uphold German values. Haber converted to Christianity. He discovered a process to synthesize Ammonia, which the Germans used to build explosives. Nernst learnt the army drill and took to testing teargas. Planck openly supported Germany and encouraged his students to participate in the war. </P>
          <P>The intelligentsia of Germany prepared a war petition in support of the government. It was called the Manifesto of the 93, after the 93 intellectuals who signed it. It stressed the necessity of war and claimed that Germany had no involvement in the attack on civilians in Belgium. (In July 1914, Germany invaded the weak and neutral Belgium. After the battle the German soldiers massacred many civilians leading to what is called the Rape of Belgium). The petition was signed by Planck, Nernst and Haber. The other important signatory was Philipp Lenard who had worked on the photoelectric effect and later became Einstein’s enemy. Einstein was not asked to sign the Manifesto as he was a Swiss national; he would not have signed such a petition anyway. </P>
          <P>Einstein, on the other hand, worked on a different manifesto calling for internationalism. His main supporter was another Jew, Georg Nicolai and his manifesto attracted no more than two or three people. Einstein then formed a league and toyed with the idea of a possible United States of Europe, which could unite all European countries and thus prevent future wars. Einstein and Nicolai wrote A Manifesto to Europeans. Only four people, including Einstein and Nicolai signed it. The government quickly banned the league. </P>
          <P>Einstein would not leave it at that. He collaborated with the famous French writer Romain Rolland (winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1915) who was trying to promote a relationship between France and Germany. He also engaged in verbal conflicts with fanatical German scientists such as Paul Hertz. Einstein did not endorse the feelings of the mainstream Germans. He dared to publish an essay 'My Opinion of the War' in the journal of the Goethe League. </P>
          <P>Living away from Children </P>
          <P>Despite an objective and scientific temperament, Einstein found it difficult to be estranged from his children. Hans wrote to his father frequently and kept him abreast of the progress he and his brother were making. Einstein particularly admired Hans’ interest in geometry. While Hans wished his father paid them a visit, Eduard had dreamt that he had indeed made such a visit! Einstein did plan to see his children by the Easter of 1915. War prevented him from doing so. The trip was rescheduled to July. </P>
          <P>In the meantime, letters and angry words were exchanged between Mileva and Einstein. He was totally taken aback when he received a letter from Hans (about eleven years old by now) which read, “If you are unfriendly to mother, I do not want to go with you.” Einstein concluded that Mileva was setting his children against him. Nevertheless, he instructed one of his doctor friends to watch Eduard when he had an ear infection. </P>
          <P>Einstein did visit his family in September that year. Mileva wanted him to stay with her and the children. But Einstein stayed in a hotel and met his friends Besso and Zangger often. He visited his children only twice during his stay of three weeks. Later, Einstein went to the extent of cancelling his trip to see his children for Christmas – “I am too tired because of my work. I cannot sit in the train for two hours and twenty minutes.” </P>
          <P>On his return to Berlin, Einstein checked out of the apartment where he had lived with his family and moved to a smaller one, close to where Elsa lived. </P>
          <P>Amazing Theory </P>
          <P>1915 was an important year for Einstein and for science and history. It was the year physics took a giant leap forward. Einstein gave a new interpretation of gravity. According to him it was not a force that acted between two objects, but a consequence of the distorted space time continuum around the object. </P>
          <P>We have seen that he was busy with his theories all through his life. After proposing his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, he was continually working towards extending it to accelerating systems. </P>
          <P>The Prussian Academy met every week in the Prussian State Library. About fifty members used to assemble and listen to some learned talk. Einstein delivered four lectures in November 1915. It was on the 25<SPAN><Sup>th</Sup></SPAN> of this month, that he presented the paper that shook the scientists of the world – The Field Equations of Gravitation. In this paper, Einstein had presented his General Theory of Relativity. The paper was published in Annalen der Physik the following March.</P>
          <P>It has been hailed as one of history’s most imaginative and dramatic revisions of the concepts of the universe. Extending Newton’s theory, Einstein had developed a theory which was valid at all speeds, even those close to that of light. Space and time were no longer independent as Newton had believed; rather they were inter-dependent. The highlights of the Theory of Relativity are discussed in Part 2 of the book. </P>
          <P>Scientists were astonished, newspapers were thrilled, common men stood amazed. Says Paul Dirac (a pioneer of quantum mechanics and a Nobel Laureate), “Probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made.” Max Born, another Nobel Laureate, says, “Greatest feat of human thinking about nature, the most amazing combination of philosophical penetration, physical intuition and mathematical skill.” </P>

          <P>Divorce</P>
          <P>We have seen that Einstein did not want to completely sever ties with Mileva although he was now separated from her. He was not prepared to marry Elsa even though she and her family pressed him to do so. But eventually, he yielded to Elsa’s pressure and pleaded Mileva for a divorce. In his letter to her in this regard, strangely enough, he asked her to take care of the children and also to monitor their calcium levels. Mileva refused to budge at first. But then, Einstein begged saying that he had to marry Elsa to put an end to public gossip. Almost as a bribe, he offered to increase the funds he was providing her. At the same time, he asked that the children be sent to Berlin as he wanted to see them. Mileva did not consent to any of the minor requests, but agreed to start the divorce proceedings. </P>
          <P>Mileva had another mental breakdown and was bedridden. Hans and Eduard were sent to live with Besso in Zurich and subsequently to Mileva’s friend Savic in Lausanne. The situation worsened. Mileva was admitted to a sanatorium. Einstein was not moved. He did not think it necessary to visit Mileva or his children. He remained absorbed in physics!</P>
          <P>However, it was not easy for him to ignore his children. He wrote to his friend – if she dies I will take care of them and bring them up very well. He had his own plans of how he would raise them. At one point of time, he even wrote to Hans describing his fantasies about raising him and his brother. Obviously angry, Hans did not reply. However, he wrote to his father much later to announce that mother was back home from the sanatorium and that the boys were having a nice time with her. </P>
          <P>It was during this tumultuous time that Einstein wrote a formal description of his General Theory as the popular book, Relativity: The Special and The General Theory. It appears that he read every page of it to Elsa’s eighteen year old daughter Margot just to make sure the book was understood by the average person. One wonders whether the book is really so easy to follow, leave alone for laypersons, even for scientists!</P>
          <P>When life posed a problem, science gave him the shelter and refuge required. It was as if the diurnal happenings did not bother him in the least. Only science mattered. All other things he could ignore. He made it explicit in his speech delivered on the sixtieth birthday of Max Planck – “One of the strongest motives that leads men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness. Such men make this cosmos and its construction the pivot of their emotional life in order to find peace and security which they cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.” Perhaps, this is a fitting description of Einstein himself. No doubt, this was drawn from his personal experience. </P>
          <P>It was 1917. Einstein was 38. He developed a stomach pain. He did not pay much attention to it. He stated, philosophically, “My task of developing the Theory of Relativity is complete. It is okay if I die.” But his friend Freundlich would not let him suffer. He compelled Einstein to see a doctor. It was found that his sickness was due to malnutrition, a common ailment in Germany due to food shortage resulting from the war. Einstein was placed on a diet of rice, macaroni and Zwieback (a type of crisp, sweetened bread, made with eggs and baked twice). </P>
          <P>Living all alone, it was difficult to adhere to this diet. His friend Zangger sent supplies from Zurich. In spite of it, Einstein lost 22 kilograms in just two months. Elsa was concerned. She rented an apartment close to hers and requested him to shift so she could take care of him. Now, Einstein followed a diet of eggs, bread of his choice and butter, all very scarce during wartime. Elsa was rich. She even bought him cigars, an expensive luxury in those war-ravaged times! Now, with Elsa living nearby the two met almost every day. She nursed him very well.</P>
          <P>Matters became worse when Eduard became sick again, this time with a lung inflammation. Einstein even felt that it was better for Eduard to die than lead a life debilitated by illness. He travelled to Zurich to take care of the boy’s medical needs. He admitted Eduard to a sanatorium in Arosa. Hans’ sympathy for his father suffering from stomach pain, improved their relationship. A sum of 1500 crowns, he received from the academy in Vienna for a lecture, helped Einstein pay Eduard’s medical bills. </P>
          <P>Now that they met every day, it was easier for Elsa to persuade Einstein to divorce Mileva and marry her. Einstein, tuned to a divorce, sent word to Mileva. He promised her 9000 Marks of which 2000 would go to a future fund for the children’s benefit. </P>
          <P>He came up with another masterstroke. It was evident that sooner or later he would be awarded the Nobel Prize. He offered the entire money to Mileva. Those days, the prize money was 225,000 marks; Mileva would have to wait 37 years to make such an amount of money! Further, it would be given in the Swedish currency which was more stable than the German mark. </P>
          <P>Mileva reviewed her situation. Her health was bad, Eduard was still in the sanatorium; her sister who helped her, had been admitted to a sanatorium and her brother, a soldier, had been captured by the Russians. Really, she would be a fool not to accept such an offer. She informed Einstein, “I accept this offer. I do not want to stand in the way of your happiness.” However, she demanded that she be allowed to retain her name as Mrs. Einstein!</P>
          <P>Paper work and deliberations started and it was a long-drawn affair. Einstein remarked, “We have to see whether the war will end before I get my divorce!” Mileva felt that Elsa was siphoning all the money from her husband, which was not true. However, the hypothetical question remained – Will Einstein pay compensation if he was not awarded the Nobel Prize? An amicable settlement was reached in the end.</P>
          <P> Einstein attraction for Elsa only grew stronger by the day. In his vacation of 1918, he preferred to be with her than visit his children. They spent time at a resort near the Baltic Sea, Einstein reading and pondering over quantum mechanics. He was glad to be away from visitors and telephone calls. His food had to be specially prepared and he entertained very few friends. He wrote a letter of apology to Hans stating that a detour to Zurich to visit him would be very difficult. He, however encouraged Hans to pursue his ambitions and kept him abreast of developments in science. </P>
          <P>At this juncture, Einstein was offered a position jointly by the Zurich Polytechnic and the University. He was free to decide what he would do. As can be expected, Elsa was not in favour of moving to Zurich. Furthermore, Einstein himself dreaded the fireworks that would result if Mileva and Elsa were in proximity. Einstein rejected the offer. </P>
          <P>Verification of the General Theory </P>
          <P>Any theory, however grand it is, is worth nothing till it is experimentally verified - theory guides and experiment decides. That was the status of the Theory of Relativity to start with. One of the predictions that could be verified was that light from a distant star deflects as it nears the sun. </P>
          <P>In 1914, Erwin Freundlich an astronomer from Berlin wanted to experiment and verify the deflection of light. This experiment had to be performed only during a total solar eclipse when sunlight is completely blocked from vision on earth. On any other day, observing distant starts was impossible due to the sun’s brightness. One such eclipse occurred in Crimea in Russia on August 21, 1914. Freundlich set out to test the theory. Einstein encouraged him and arrangements started almost a year ahead.</P>
          <P>An interesting incident occurred in 1913 when Freundlich took his wife to see Einstein in the mountains near Zurich. Einstein met them at the train station and took them and some of his assistants for lunch to a restaurant. Not unusually, Einstein had forgotten to bring any money. Luckily, an assistant slipped a 100 franc note under the table for Einstein to pay the bill. Later, Einstein promised Freundlich 2000 marks towards his expedition if required.</P>
          <P>As Freundlich and others were travelling towards Crimea, war broke out. The members of the expedition were captured by the Russian army. Their equipment was confiscated. Besides, the weather on the chosen day turned cloudy making any observation impossible.</P>
          <P>Lucky for science, Freundlich was not successful. At that point of time there was an error in the theory. The extent of deflection of light calculated by Einstein was short by half the actual amount.</P>
          <P>England vs Germany </P>
          <P>Communication among scientists proved very difficult because of the war. Einstein’s theory took some time to reach other countries. Holland was neutral and allowed information exchange. The Dutch astronomer William de Sitter in Leiden managed to send the paper on the General Theory of Relativity across to Arthur Eddington, a British astronomer in Cambridge, England. Eddington exclaimed at once, “Whether the theory proves to be correct or not, it claims attention as being one of the most beautiful examples of general mathematical reasoning.” </P>
          <P>A total solar eclipse was to occur on May 29, 1919 in the village of Sobral in the Amazon jungle in Brazil and at Principe, a small Portuguese island off the west coast of Africa. Eddington teamed with Frank Dyson and managed to procure government funding for two expeditions, one each to Sobral and Principe. The purpose of the mission was to test Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Funds were granted, and the war ended; there was no obstacle to travel. Eddington took charge of the observations at Principe. The eclipse started at 3:13 pm and lasted less than five minutes. There was some anxiety as rain poured down all morning. However, towards the afternoon it subsided. Eddington was busy changing the film in the camera and simultaneously keeping watch over the sky. He hardly watched the eclipse as he took sixteen pictures. Eddington was happy that observations could be carried out. The captured pictures had to still be analysed. Weather in Sobral was more cooperative. </P>
          <P>The question was whether the deflection would be 0.85 seconds of arc as the English scientist Isaac Newton’s theory had predicted or 1.7 seconds of arc as the German scientist Albert Einstein had predicted. Eddington measured an average deflection of 1.7 seconds of arc! Eddington felt it was his personal victory. The measurements made by the other British party in Brazil had to be discarded as the equipment was found to be faulty.</P>
          <P>Einstein was aware of the Eddington expedition. Eddington informed Lorentz in Leiden who, in turn, cabled Einstein on October 22, 1919 and conveyed the good news. </P>
          <P>Einstein was sure that the outcome would be positive. He informed his mother, “Lorentz has telegraphed me that the British expeditions have verified the deflection of light by the sun.” </P>
          <P>Another incident is often quoted. Einstein was with his student Ilse Schneider when the telegram arrived. “This may interest you”, he said and handed the telegram to her. Reading it, Ilse felt like dancing; she was excited. But he remained calm, and said, "I knew my theory was correct."</P>
          <P>“What would you have done if the experiments had proved that your theory was wrong?”</P>
          <P>“I would have been sorry for the dear Lord. My theory is correct!” </P>
          <P>After this, Eddington also rose to a new height. At one point it was thought that only three men in the world understood Relativity. When asked about this, Eddington remarked, “I wonder who the third one is!” </P>
          <P>Einstein celebrated his success by buying a new violin. </P>
          <P>Is he a German or a Swiss Jew?</P>
          <P>Einstein was hated by the Germans for he was a Swiss Jew. Dislike towards him was very strong in England where he was regarded as a German. He was nominated for the prestigious gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1920. But a group of patriotic British protested and garnered enough votes in their favour and prevented the award from being given to Einstein. However, respect towards Einstein increased in the coming years; he was awarded the medal in 1926, which he graciously accepted. </P>
          <P>Einstein – A Social Democrat </P>
          <P>Germany lost the war which ended in November 1918. The Kaiser abdicated the throne; a republican government came to power. Einstein was compelled to come out of his scientific shell and speak his mind. There was a general strike in Germany and students boycotted lectures in universities across the nation. On November 8, the Worker-Student Revolutionary Council took over the University of Berlin and arrested the deans and the rector. It was an exhibition of nationalism and pro-German feelings. Against this background, Einstein was definitely an internationalist. </P>
          <P>Einstein thought that it was time to act as per his conscience and work towards releasing the deans and the rector. He telephoned Max Born, a fellow physicist, asking him to cooperate. Though he was down with flu, Max Born agreed to join him. He also invited Walt Wertheimer, a physiologist. The three took a train to Reichstag where students were rallying. The assembled mob recognised Einstein and led him to a room where the committee was in meeting to formulate new regulations for the university. Einstein was asked to comment. He was dauntless and spoke for the academic freedom of the university. He opined that professors are not to be told what to teach and students must have the freedom to choose their subject of study. Einstein warned that the new regulations would curtail the freedom of the universities. However, students did not release the deans and the rector claiming lack of authority to do so. </P>
          <P>Thus Einstein and his friends approached the new German president who readily ordered their release. </P>
          <P>Elsa is Mrs Einstein </P>
          <P>Einstein was granted divorce by a court in Zurich on February 14, 1919. Nothing now prevented him from marrying Elsa. The two married in June 1919. Soon after, he went to Zurich to spend time with his children and took them sailing. He also entertained them with music and science projects such as model building. </P>
          <P>One can easily guess that this was not a marriage of two brains. Elsa was little interested in science. She would say, “Relativity is not essential for my happiness. Mathematics is necessary only to follow house hold bills”. She was more a mother than a wife to him. Her fluency in French and English allowed her to serve as interpreter to her husband during overseas visits. Everything in Einstein’s non-scientific life became Elsa’s concerns. She would take care of what he ate and how he dressed (not that he obeyed her orders in this). She kept his room and made his bed. When it came to travel, she packed his suitcase and ensured he carried enough money for the travel. Of course, she enjoyed being the wife of a great scientist, sharing all the glory and honour that came with it.</P>
          <P>Elsa made sure that Einstein’s working atmosphere was calm and undisturbed. She would bring him from his study down to the dining room to eat a meal of sausages and soup. Sometimes, he would be so engrossed in work, he could not be budged. Then Elsa would serve his meal in his study. When Einstein grumbled about eating, she cautioned him, “People have centuries to discover things, but your stomach will not wait for centuries.” When he was more relaxed, he would come down from his study and take Elsa and her daughters for a walk. Always, the suggestion to go out had to come from him, not the other way around. </P>
          <P>Einstein and Elsa lived in an apartment with Ilse and Margot. It was tastefully furnished with green wallpaper and white linen with lace embroidery. The study was a large room in the attic with a big window. Pictures of Newton, Maxwell and Faraday decorated the walls. </P>
          <P>Eventually, Ilse married Rudolf Kayser, the editor of a literary magazine in Germany while Margot, who became a sculptor, married Dimitri Marianoff, a Russian. </P>
          <P>Fame travels at speed of light</P>
          <P>No sooner had the Royal Society of England hailed Einstein as the new star of physics, than the media worked overtime garnering and publishing as much news about him and his discoveries as possible. Americans also joined the bandwagon of admirers. “Revolution in science, Newtonian ideas overthrown”, “Epoch Making” and “Einstein Theory Triumphs”, were some headlines that made their way into the newspapers. The press brought out special editions to explain R Relativity. Numerous interviews with Einstein were published. The book penned by Einstein was published in English. Sales of the book sky rocketed. Publishers who struggled to understand the concept of Relativity requested Einstein to write a short synopsis that could be used for promotional purposes. </P>
          <P>His colleagues Eddington, Max Born, Von Lue, Planck and Freundlich were compelled to give public lectures on Relativity, many times to capacity crowds. When Einstein’s student Leopald Infeld lectured in Poland, in spite of it being a cold night, the crowd could not be accommodated in the biggest hall in town. At Eddington’s speech in Cambridge, hundreds assembled, and hundreds were sent back due to shortage of seats. It was as if a blockbuster had been released; people had to see it on the first day.</P>
          <P>The press pressured Einstein to write another book, and the result was the classic, What is Relativity? Bertrand Russell wrote ABC of Relativity. Einstein’s colleagues too wrote books on Relativity. Six hundred books and articles appeared on Relativity within the first six years! </P>
          <P>That begs the question, Was Einstein really as averse to publicity as popularly believed? All the evidence suggests otherwise. He gave interviews; he wrote popular books; he even appeared with Charlie Chaplin. “There was a streak in him that enjoyed the photographers and the crowd,” says C P Snow, a chemist, who excelled as a science writer and novelist. He continues, “He had an element of the exhibitionist and the ham. If there had not been that element, there would have been no photographers and no crowds. Nothing is easier to avoid than publicity. If one genuinely does not want to get it, one does not get it.” In the words of American writer and biographer, Walter Isaacson, “Einstein performed. He gave interviews readily, peppered them with delightful aphorisms, and knew exactly what made for a good story.” </P>
          <P>Elsa was no different. She liked attention. She even charged money when people took pictures of him; however, she donated the money to charity. </P>
          <P>The first Idea of a Bomb</P>
          <P>Einstein travelled to Prague, where he had worked a few years before. He wanted to be away from public glare and get some quiet time. He stayed with Philipp Frank and his wife who lived in a small room in the physics laboratory (where Einstein used to work). He had to sleep on the sofa. At a small reception given to him by the department, instead of delivering a lecture, he played a sonata by Mozart. </P>
          <P>While Einstein was in Prague, a young gentleman met him and produced a piece of paper. He had shown that on the basis of the equation E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>, energy contained in an atom can be released to produce explosives. Einstein branded the concept foolish and dismissed the young man. If only he had listened to him patiently! It is now history that the same foolish idea led indirectly to the making of the atomic bomb! </P>
          <P>From Prague, Einstein went to Vienna where a crowd of three thousand scientists waited to hear him speak. The host was to meet him at the train station. He checked the first class car; no trace of Einstein. He checked the second class car; still no trace of him. But there he was, the world renowned scientist at the end of the platform emerging from a third class car with a violin in his hand, like a street musician! </P>
          <P>Relativity and Philosophy </P>
          <P>Space is relative, time is relative. There is nothing which is absolute, said Einstein. Relativity for him was nothing more than a scientific theory, with particular relevance in physics. But the world around was so overwhelmed by the incessant media coverage and Einstein’s numerous appearances that the concept began to be generalised and applied to all areas of human activity, be it art, literature, philosophy or even sociology. Absolute does not exist; everything is relative, became the new mantra. The idea seemed novel and Einstein’s name crossed the boundary of science. However, he did not approve or like it. </P>
          <P>Lord Haldane, a British statesman, was a scholar in science and philosophy. He wrote the book Reign of Relativity and tried to show that Relativity exists outside the realm of science. Haldane invited Einstein to London in 1921. A dinner was hosted in his honour and eminent people from various fields, such as George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Eddington, the Archbishop of Canterbury were invited. Seated next to Einstein, the archbishop expressed concerns about the ramifications that Relativity might have on religion. Einstein replied plainly, “Relativity is a purely scientific matter and has nothing to do with religion.”</P>

          <P>The Call of The Jews </P>
          <P>As stated earlier, the British had their reservations about Einstein for he was considered German; the Germans were outraged that he was a Jew. It was easy for the latter to make Jews the scapegoat for their defeat in the war and its repercussions. At this juncture, Einstein felt he could not remain indifferent to the events shaping up around him and was compelled to take a stand. One such cause that warranted his attention was Zionism. He sympathised with the Jewish cause and openly supported the formation of a Hebrew University in Jerusalem. But he would not affiliate himself with any Zionist organisation</P>
          <P>Anti-Semitic feelings were raging in Germany and Einstein became a soft target. One of the outspoken Germans who voiced his opinion was Paul Weyland, an engineer. He sought to diminish the influence of Jews in the government and society at large. He wrote articles claiming that Relativity was a Jewish hoax. He laid the foundation for an organisation called The Study Group of German Scientists for the Preservation of Science. Ernst Gehrcke, a theoretical physicist, joined him. </P>
          <P> A big rally was held at the Berlin Philharmonic on August 20, 1920. Money was lavishly spent. Both Weyland and Gehrcke spoke their usual rhetoric – “Theory of Relativity is Jewish and communist. It poisons the wellsprings of German science.” The news was also published in the New York Times. As Gehrcke spoke, there was a disturbance and murmur in the audience. “Einstein, Einstein”. Einstein had come to the rally to enjoy the fun! He regarded it as a joke. </P>
          <P>But he was very perturbed; he considered moving away from Berlin. He wrote an article in a local paper that read, “Those two speakers are not worthy of my pen.” </P>
          <P>Another physicist, Philipp Lenard was behind the attack on Jewish scientists. Well known to Einstein, he had worked on the photoelectric effect and was also the recipient of the 1905 Nobel Prize. The publicity and fame that Einstein had achieved for his Theory of Relativity had made Lenard envious. </P>
          <P>By expressing his views against nationalism, Einstein had only made matters worse. His own friends wished he had not written the article. Lenard on the other hand condemned it and demanded an apology. Einstein would not render one. This further enraged Lenard and drove him to publicly become an Anti-Semite and a Nazi. </P>
          <P>There were also other groups and organisations that tried to put down Jewish Science as they called it. Adolf Hitler led the attack in 1921 by writing in a newspaper thus, “Science is being taught by Hebrews.” </P>
          <P>Mother’s Death </P>
          <P>Objectivity takes a backseat when it comes to intimate human relationships, especially with regards to one’s mother; the selfless soul who bestows unconditional love and affection upon her children. Einstein’s mother Pauline was suffering from stomach cancer and needed special care. She moved to his house towards the end of 1919 and died in February 1920. It was the second occasion when he wept (the first was when Mileva moved away taking his children with her).</P>
          <P>Listen to the heart – Travel to America</P>
          <P>Kurt Blumenfeld was the leader of the Zionist movement in Germany. He had sought Einstein’s support in the past for the creation of a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Though supportive of the cause, Einstein did not become a member of the local Jewish organisation but made a contribution to one of the welfare schemes of the association. However, Einstein eventually became a member for purely social reasons. </P>
          <P>In 1921, Blumenfeld came with a message from Chaim Weizmann, President of the World Zionist Organisation. Weizmann was a biochemist who had migrated from Russia to America. He later became the first president of Israel.</P>
          <P>Weizmann invited Einstein to accompany him on a tour of America to generate funds to start a Hebrew University in Jerusalem. At first Einstein declined the request. After all, he was only a scientist and not an orator who could attract people or funds. But soon it became apparent that Weizmann’s request was almost an order. Einstein had to consent. Further, his heart compelled him to help the Zionist cause. The fame of Relativity had carried with it a certain responsibility towards the Jews. He had committed himself to the Solvay Congress, to be held soon. He sent his apology to the organisers. </P>
          <P>America, which had fought against Germany in the war, received the news of Einstein’s visit with enthusiasm. Lecture invitations, honorary doctorates, awards and honours poured in. America prepared itself to receive him. </P>
          <P>Einstein set sail from Holland on March 21, 1921. He sought two cabins in the ship, one for himself and the other for Elsa so he could concentrate on his work during travel. As the ship crossed the Atlantic, Einstein explained his Theory of Relativity to Weizmann, but in vain. </P>
          <P>On April 2, the ship reached Manhattan. Einstein alighted dressed in a grey wool coat and felt hat, a pipe in one hand and violin in the other. As can be expected, reporters eagerly awaited him. They had a thousand questions to ask. </P>
          <P>The first meeting with the press took place in the captain’s cabin. Reporters were hardly interested in his present mission. They were more interested in Relativity. </P>
          <P>“Please give a one-sentence description of Relativity.”</P>
          <P>“I am trying to compress Relativity into a single book,  you want me compress it to a sentence!” </P>
          <P>When he was compelled he merely said, “It is a theory of space and time as far as physics is concerned. It leads to a theory of gravitation.”</P>
          <P>Einstein confessed that he thought the opponents of the theory were politically driven. It was anti-Semitism. When Elsa was questioned by reporters about her understanding of Relativity she remarked, “It is not required for my happiness.” </P>
          <P>The mayor of New York received him. As Einstein was taken to his hotel through the Jewish part of the city, thousands of spectators lined the route. He was greeted by honks of cars everywhere. More than ten thousand people assembled when Einstein and Weizmann were given a public reception. Einstein was indeed surprised when a gentleman named Max Talmey, a physician greeted him. He was none other than Max Talmud, who had lent him books back in Munich in his childhood. Einstein visited his daughters at his apartment. </P>
          <P>He stayed in New York for three weeks delivering lectures and attending receptions. Since he spoke in German, hardly anyone understood him. Yet the crowds jostled and craved for a glance of this great scientist. Every venue was packed, with people even standing in the aisles. After all he was the superstar of physics! </P>
          <P>The next stop was Washington. Funnily enough, the American Senate tried to debate Relativity. In a meeting, President Warren G. Harding confessed he knew nothing of the theory. A reception at the National Science Academy followed. Unable to bear long boring speeches, Einstein told the man seated next to him, “I have now developed a theory of eternity”. The academy building now houses a 12 foot tall bronze statue of Einstein. </P>
          <P>By the time he went to Chicago, Einstein was quite comfortable with the reporters. Strangely enough, the press seemed to have formed an impression that only twelve people in the world understood the Theory of Relativity. He corrected them saying, “Anyone who has studied science can understand it if he puts in effort.” </P>
          <P>Lectures all through the week and honorary degrees from universities marked his stay in Princeton. The university undertook to publish his lectures in the form of a book entitled The Meaning of Relativity, popular even today. He spoke in German and scribbled some 125 equations on the blackboard. After one such lecture, Einstein apparently uttered the following words - “Raffiniertist der Herrgott, aber boshaft ist er nicht”; translated as God is subtle, but he is not malicious. Professor Veblen overheard these words and sought his permission to etch them in concrete in the very room where he uttered them. This building later became the home of the Institute of Advanced Study where Einstein worked during his last years. An explanation of the quote given by Einstein himself is, “Nature conceals her secrets by her sublimity and not by trickery.” </P>
          <P>Einstein visited Harvard and Cleveland, now the Case Western Reserve University. This is where Michelson and Morley had conducted their famous experiment and had showed that the speed of light is the same for all observers, irrespective of their motion. </P>
          <P>The tour gave Einstein publicity and exposure. It confirmed his resolve to fight for the Jewish cause. But it was not a big success financially. Weizmann had hoped to raise 4 million dollars. Only about 750,000 dollars were collected. </P>
          <P>Situation deteriorates in Germany </P>
          <P>After his return from America Einstein visited England where he addressed the Royal Society and paid his respects to Isaac Newton, by placing a wreath on his grave in Westminster Abbey. During the France tour that followed, he visited the war graves of soldiers who had laid down their lives protecting their country. </P>
          <P>Einstein went to Zurich and stayed with his family. He was happy to see his children doing very well. There was happiness, music flowed. </P>
          <P>Germany itself was going downhill with acute inflation breaking the economy. A loaf of bread that costed about 1 mark in 1920 costed 700 marks in 1923 and later reached 1 billion marks! Germany was forced to issue a new currency. They had to find scapegoats. Yes, they were readily available; the French, the English, the internationalists, and of course, the Jews. </P>
          <P>Walther Rathenau</P>
          <P>Walther Rathenau was a wealthy businessman in Berlin and the son of the founder of the AEG (General Electric Company). Though a Jew, he was a patriot. He rose through the ranks in the ministry and became the foreign minister of Germany. Einstein and Rathenau knew each other very well. However, Rathenau did not endorse Zionism. </P>
          <P>Rathenau was responsible for the Treaty of Versailles with France and the Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union. Though the treaties helped end the war, the Germans saw it as a defeat and a conspiracy of the Jews, resulting in young nationalists assassinating Rathenau on June 24, 1922. The whole country was moved. Offices, schools and colleges were closed for his funeral as a mark of respect and a million people assembled to pay their tribute. </P>
          <P>Two people did not mourn his death. Hitler hailed the assassins as national heroes. Philipp Lenard did not cancel his lectures in the university. </P>
          <P>The assassination sent shock waves all over Europe. The police discovered that Einstein’s name was on the hit list of the nationalists. They warned Einstein that he could be the next target. He was advised to move out of Berlin and avoid public appearances. Einstein moved to Kiel, a town about 90 kms from Hamburg in Northern Germany. He even toyed with the idea of settling down and working in an engineering firm in Kiel. But Relativity and cosmology were pulling him the other way; science was lucky, theoretical physics in particular. </P>
          <P>Einstein was a member of the League of Nations and was on its committee for intellectual cooperation. The League sought to induce a pacifist spirit among the member nations. With rising anti-Semitism in Germany, he tendered his resignation, but was persuaded to withdraw. The committee required that its members address the students of the Geneva University. Einstein gave a violin concert instead! Somebody asked him how he was able to remain calm when there was so much turmoil in the world. He answered, “We must remember that this is a very small star. And probably some of the larger and more important stars may be virtuous and happy.” </P>
          <P>Celebrity Again</P>
          <P>The nationalists wanted his blood. Einstein lived in fear. His fame was a direct threat to his life. However, he did get an opportunity to move away from the political turmoil of Germany and enjoy the life of a celebrity. He was invited by his Japanese publisher to undertake a lecture tour of Japan. He accepted, and toured Asia and Israel during 1922 - 23. </P>
          <P>Einstein experienced a wide variety of cultures and manners. In Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka) he was transported from place to place in a rickshaw pulled by men. Einstein disapproved such exploitation of human beings. The Jews living in Singapore assembled to welcome him. Sir Menasseh Meyer, a very rich man, donated a large sum of money to the Hebrew University. </P>
          <P>As he was travelling to Japan he received news that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1921. He received a telegram on November 10, which read, “Nobel Prize for physics awarded to you. More by letter.” In fact, he had indications before he left Berlin. The chairman of the Nobel Committee had requested him to postpone the Asia trip and be available to visit Stockholm in December. Einstein could not put off the trip and undertook the tour as per schedule. </P>
          <P>Einstein received 2,000 pounds for his lecture series in Japan. His lecture in Tokyo was attended by as many as twenty five thousand people. The lecture, of course with an interpreter, went on for four hours. Einstein took pity on his audience and reduced the duration of his next lecture in another city to three hours. The organisers were deeply hurt as they took it as an insult. Einstein had to stick to his four hour lectures! </P>
          <P>He also met the emperor and empress of Japan. Einstein liked the Japanese and wrote to his son, “Of all the people I have met, I like the Japanese the most, as they are modest, intelligent and considerate and have a feel for art.” Einstein was devastated when the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. </P>
          <P>In Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, Einstein was treated on par with a head of state. Even a gun salute was issued. Their royal formality knew no bounds and Einstein was compelled to accept the princely arrangements.</P>
          <P>Einstein took a walk to the temples and the Western Wall. He felt that, “The Jews were a people with a past but no future.” He also attended a Zionist reception and remarked that it was a great day in his life. </P>
          <P>He was asked everywhere in Israel, “Would you like to come and settle down in Jerusalem?” The considered answer was, “My heart says yes, but my reason says no.” </P>
          <P>Einstein and the Nobel Prize</P>
          <P>Today, in the twenty first century, there are no reservations about weather Einstein deserved the Nobel Prize. But the circumstance was different in Germany a hundred years ago. </P>
          <P>The story begins in 1910 when Wilhelm Ostwald nominated Einstein for the Nobel Prize. In fact, he was the one that Einstein had approached, in vain, for a job nine years earlier. His proposal was based on Einstein’s work on Relativity. Ostwald argued that Relativity was a theory in physics and not a philosophy as many had assumed. The nomination was rejected.</P>
          <P>Einstein was nominated for the prize quite a few times in the following years. The terms of the Nobel Prize stated that it should be awarded to the most important discovery or invention. Some people opined that Relativity was neither of the two. There were quite a few sceptics; they sought experimental verification of the theory, which was also successfully provided in 1919 as we have seen. Noted scientists such as Lorentz, Niels Bohr and other friends submitted nominations in favour of Einstein, hailing him as an avant-garde scientist. </P>
          <P>Politics began to play. Some German scientists strongly envied Einstein’s popularity. Philipp Lenard and Gehrcke became active behind the scenes. They tried to pull down Relativity itself. Surprisingly, in 1920, the prize was awarded to Charles Guillaume, associated with making alloys when many people felt it was Einstein’s turn. </P>
          <P>In 1921, fourteen scientists including Planck and Eddington nominated Einstein again. Said Eddington, “He stands above his contemporaries as Newton did.” This time, Allvar Gullstrand, an ophthalmologist, was requested to prepare a report. He was bent on writing a negative report on Relativity and he did. The result, nobody was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. </P>
          <P>In reality, the Nobel committee had put itself to shame. Sincere scientists and thinkers were outraged. The French physicist Marcel Brillouin wrote to the committee, “Think for a moment what the general opinion will be fifty years from now, if Einstein’s name does not appear on the list of Nobel laureates.” Now, the task of saving the committee from ridicule fell on Carl Wilhelm Oseen, a theoretical physicist. He was sure that the very mention of Relativity should somehow be avoided. So, he thought that Einstein’s chances of winning the prize would be better if he cited the photoelectric effect. He weighed every word and prepared his supportive report on Einstein. He called Einstein’s theory the Law of Photoelectric Effect. </P>
          <P>Oseen was exceedingly clever. He made another suggestion; “Give Einstein the delayed 1921 prize and let Niels Bohr have the 1922 prize.” The Nobel committee accepted the recommendation. </P>
          <P>The award ceremony was held on December 10, 1922, and Einstein could not be present as he was touring Japan. As was the practice, the ambassador of the recipient’s country (in this case Germany) was to receive the prize on behalf of the recipient. Einstein did not like the idea of the German ambassador representing him; he preferred the Swiss ambassador. But the German government objected saying that the recipient of the award being a German, only the German ambassador is entitled to represent him. The Nobel committee solved the problem by requesting the Swedish ambassador in Germany to go over to Einstein in Berlin and hand over the medal and the certificate. </P>
          <P>Einstein delivered his acceptance speech the next year in July. He spoke only about Relativity and barely mentioned the photoelectric effect. The prize money amounted to 121,572 Kroner or USD 32,250, all of which went to Mileva as per the divorce agreement. She bought three houses and rental properties. </P>

          <P>Explosion in Physics </P>
          <P>We have seen that Einstein made public his theories on Relativity between 1905 and 1915, which were also verified through experiments or physical measurements. Quite a few other discoveries took place around this time leading to an explosion in the scope of physics. Most of these influenced Einstein’s own research and thinking. A brief description follows. </P>
          <P>Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962)</P>
          <P>Niels Bohr established a new model for the structure of the atom in 1913. Six years younger than Einstein, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1922. A Dane by birth, he was attracted by the work of Planck, Einstein, J. J. Thomson and Ernst Rutherford. </P>
          <P>Bohr found that electrons circled round the nucleus of the atom in permitted orbits. By absorbing energy from radiation only in increments, they were pushed to a bigger permitted orbit. They could also emit radiation (hence energy) in increments and move to a smaller orbit. Einstein based some of his papers on Bohr’s ideas. Bohr opined that during emission and absorption the photons pulse out or pulse in, in all directions at once. </P>
          <P>There was a problem. There was no way to determine which way the photons would go. Further, there was no way to predict when it would happen. Thus, only the probability of a photon moving in a certain direction and the probability that a photon would be emitted at a certain moment could be calculated. Chance and probability entered the picture. </P>
          <P>Niels Bohr and his student Werner Heisenberg developed many aspects of Quantum Mechanics in Copenhagen between 1924 and 1927. Their findings form what is widely known as Copenhagen Interpretation, according to which, “a quantum particle doesn’t exist in one state or another, but in all of its possible states at once. It’s only when we observe its state that a quantum particle is essentially forced to choose one probability, and that’s the state that we observe.”</P>
          <P>It seemed that the Newtonian cause-effect rule was being violated. According to Newton, given the state at this moment one can calculate precisely what happens at the next moment. “Not so anymore!” exclaimed Niels Bohr. Einstein would not accept it. He found it strange that an electron exposed to radiation could decide when to jump off and where to jump off, of its own accord or free will. He wrote to Max Born, “If that be true, I would prefer to be a cobbler or even an employee of the gaming house than a physicist”.</P>
          <P>Einstein and Bohr were great friends. Einstein enjoyed Bohr’s company and Bohr revered Einstein. Bohr was particularly pleased that he was awarded the Nobel Prize after Einstein. He acknowledged that he was after all following Einstein who should have received the prize first. </P>
          <P>In 1923, after delivering his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at Stockholm, Einstein stopped in Copenhagen. Bohr met him at the train station. They boarded a tram to go to Bohr’s house. At once an animated discussion about Quantum Mechanics started. They failed to notice that their stop had passed. They caught a tram in the opposite direction and resumed their discussion. Again they went too far!</P>
          <P>Louis de Broglie (1892 – 1987)</P>
          <P>The next of the “Young Turks” who disturbed Einstein was Louis de Broglie. In his 1924 dissertation, he proclaimed thus: If a wave can behave like a particle, then a particle can behave like a wave. In other words, whatever Einstein had proposed with respect to light should also be true of other particles like electrons. The wave-particle dualism should be extended to all particles, electrons, protons and others. He was also able to explain Niels Bohr’s finding that electrons change their orbits only by Quantum Leaps. His thesis was approved by Einstein, but he suspected that if particles exhibited dualism then the double slit experiment should indicate interference fringes. Perhaps he believed it would not happen as he had a strong disbelief in Quantum Theory. But surprise was in store. Experiments justified the dualism of particles. Thus Einstein became the founder of Quantum Mechanics! </P>
          <P>Satyendranath Bose (1894 – 1974)</P>
          <P>A noteworthy scientist from India, Satyendranath Bose was a theoretical physicist from Calcutta. He had a wide range of interests in varied fields including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature and music. He served on many research and development committees in independent India. He came in contact with teachers such as Jagadish Chandra Bose and Prafulla Chandra Ray who inspired him to aim high in life. He rose to top ranks in the universities of Calcutta and Dhaka and became the Vice Chancellor of Visva Bharathi University in Shanthi Nikethan. </P>
          <P>Bose found that the commonly used Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution was not applicable to tiny particles such as electrons. He came up with his own method and wrote to Einstein, even though he did not know him in person. </P>
          <P>“Respected Sir, I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient 8π ν2/c3 in Planck’s Law independent of classical electrodynamics, only assuming that the ultimate elementary region in the phase-space has the content h3. I do not know sufficient German to translate the paper. If you think the paper worth publication I shall be grateful if you arrange for its publication in ZeitschriftfürPhysik. Though a complete stranger to you, I do not feel any hesitation in making such a request. Because we are all your pupils though profiting only by your teachings through your writings. I do not know whether you still remember that somebody from Calcutta asked your permission to translate your papers on Relativity in English. You acceded to the request. The book has since been published. I was the one who translated your paper on Generalised Relativity.”</P>
          <P>Einstein readily agreed and even translated Bose’s paper into German and had it published in ZeitschriftfürPhysik under Bose’s name, in 1924. Thus came into being the Bose-Einstein Statistics. It also led to the understanding of the phenomenon, Bose-Einstein Condensation. Einstein happily undertook this task and it did not disturb him later as did the work of some other friends. </P>
          <P>Erwin Schrodinger (1887 – 1961)</P>
          <P>Erwin Schrodinger was an Austrian theoretical physicist, and author of the science classic , What is Life? He was attracted by the work of de Broglie and developed what is now famous as Wave Mechanics and derived equations to explain the wave-like behaviour of electrons and named such waves, Einstein-de Broglie Waves. Einstein failed to comprehend what the equations really stood for in the real world. Schrodinger was deeply influenced by the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads and kept copies of them by his bed side. </P>
          <P>Max Born (1882 – 1970)</P>
          <P>Max Born, a teacher in Gottingen, Germany explained the real world implications of Schrodinger’s equations. He proposed that the wave equation does not predict the behaviour of the particle but gives the probability of its location at a given moment. Einstein was once again baffled. </P>
          <P>Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976)</P>
          <P>Werner Heisenberg was a student of both Niels Bohr and Max Born. He firmly believed that any acceptable concept should be observable or measurable. Thus, he questioned the very possibility of electron orbits. His contribution to Quantum Mechanics is the Uncertainty Principle, according to which it is impossible to determine the position and the velocity (or momentum) of a particle at the same instant. The very act of determining the velocity of a particle may alter its position, he explained. Actually it meant that an electron does not have a definite path or position until we observe it. </P>
          <P>This development of uncertainty seemed strange to Einstein who believed in Determinism. Given the information on the particle at this instant of time, we should be able to accurately determine what happens next. There is no room for probability, uncertainty or chance, the key words for Quantum Mechanics. But there seemed to be a Free Will allowing the particle to behave in a random manner. How was Einstein to understand this? </P>
          <P>Philosophically it raised a very important question. Is there an absolute truth? Or is the truth dependent on how we perceive it? Heisenberg readily believed that what we perceive is the truth. There is no absolute truth. Einstein would not accept it. It is puzzling that Einstein who said that there was no absolute space, and no absolute time, insisted that there was an absolute truth! This led some of the younger scientists to even ridicule him. </P>
          <P>An interesting dialogue transpired between Einstein and Heisenberg in this regard.</P>
          <P>Heisenberg: We cannot observe electrons inside atoms. A good theory must be based on observable facts.</P>
          <P>Einstein: Don’t you believe that only observable magnitudes must go into a theory?</P>
          <P>Heisenberg: Isn’t it what you have done with Relativity?</P>
          <P>Einstein commented when speaking to Philipp Frank, “A new fashion has come about in physics wherein certain things which cannot be observed should not be ascribed reality.” </P>
          <P>Frank shot back, “This fashion you speak of was invented by you in 1905!”</P>
          <P>In 1927, during the bicentenary of Newton’s death, Einstein tried to defend a mechanics based on the principles of causality and certainty. It was the same Einstein who, just twenty years before, had shaken the pillars that Newton had established. </P>
          <P>The question was open. Does determinism rule the world? Or is there a free will? Einstein and Niels Bohr discussed this issue for many years. This question is not limited to Quantum Mechanics but is also pertinent to science, knowledge and philosophy. One of Bohr’s students has said, “In all the history of human thought, there is no greater dialogue than that which took place over the years between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein about the meaning of quantum.” C P Snow says, “No more profound intellectual debate has ever been conducted.” </P>
          <P>Einstein would say, “God does not play dice with the world.” Niels Bohr would retort, “Stop telling God what to do.” </P>
          <P>The Debate – Does God play dice with the world?</P>
          <P>Quantum Mechanics, its validity and future became the hot topic of discussion in the Solvay Conferences of 1927 and 1930. The first of these was attended by Lorentz, Planck and Einstein on behalf of the opponents of the theory. On the other hand, there were a host of scientists to argue for the theory. These included Niels Bohr, Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Crompton, Erwin Schrodinger among others. Most of them were young, in their twenties. Einstein did not speak much in the open sessions, but he engaged in lively discussions with the youngsters during breakfast, lunch and dinner. He went from person to person to campaign against the theory. Discussions between Einstein and Bohr continued. Einstein suggested thought experiments to pull down Quantum Theory. The animosity reached such a level that Ehrenfest fumed, “Einstein, I am ashamed of you.”</P>
          <P>Einstein exhibited towards the Quantum Theory the same attitude of scepticism and opposition expressed towards the Theory of Relativity by his opponents. Clearly Einstein had lost the debate. He was nevertheless cordial with de Broglie and encouraged him in his endeavours. He even went to the extent of nominating Heisenberg and Schrodinger for the Nobel Prize which they rightly deserved and were awarded. </P>

          <P>Einstein is fifty </P>
          <P>Einstein turned fifty on March 29, 1929. He preferred to spend the day in seclusion and holidayed for a few days at a cottage that belonged to his doctor. Besides his family, nobody was aware of this retreat. A family feast did take place in the afternoon. Einstein appeared in his oldest suit! A paparazzo from New York Times, however, managed to locate him and steal an interview; the news item appeared with the headline, “Einstein found hiding on his birthday.”</P>
          <P>A number of presents including a microscope and greetings came in. Einstein marvelled at a few coins from an unemployed person asking him to buy tobacco and acknowledged the gift. A girl sent him a poem. Other gifts meant little to him. </P>
          <P>Though the Council of Berlin wanted to gift Einstein the right to live for life in a house near a lake, several issues prevented the Council from making the gift. The Council considered two other plots, but once again failed. Einstein decided to buy land on his own and selected a section in the village of Caputh (today, it is the capital of Brandenburg) about 6 km south of Potsdam. The Council now wanted to gift him 20,000 marks, but nationalists objected and wanted the issue to be discussed in detail in the Council meeting. Annoyed, Einstein declined the gift.</P>
          <P>Einstein went ahead and constructed a house at his own expense. It was a simple house with a large window, offering a nice view of River Havel. He reserved a room on the ground floor for himself. The room sported a large table and a portrait of Newton. Rooms for his wife and her daughters were on the top floor. His friends gifted him a thirty-three foot long boat – Tummler (Dolphin). He liked sailing though he did not swim. Whether he sailed or remained home, his scientific contemplation never stopped. </P>
          <P>Einstein and his family</P>
          <P>With a house of his own and Elsa the woman he loved by his side, Einstein lived happily in Caputh. With Mileva he shared a love-hate relationship, which had improved after divorce. We have seen Einstein’s insensitive and indifferent treatment of Mileva. Not so after divorce. He bought her a gift from South America and when Mileva visited Berlin he invited her to stay with him and Elsa. Mileva, however, preferred to stay with the Habers. </P>
          <P>The German mark was losing its value day by day in those war-ravaged times. A mark would only fetch about two cents at one stage. So providing funds for the support of children and Mileva in Switzerland became difficult. Einstein asked them to move over to Germany. The fame that followed his General Theory improved his finances. He was paid handsome fees for his talks in universities in Europe. Einstein ensured that the money was directly sent to Ehrenfest in Holland where currency was more stable.</P>
          <P>Another person just as important as Elsa or Mileva who entered Einstein’s life was Helen Dukas who became his secretary in 1928 when Einstein was bedridden with an inflamed heart. Only after Elsa interviewed and appointed her, was she introduced to Einstein. Helen Dukas remained his trusted secretary till his death in 1955. She was never married. She kept journalists at bay and passed on to Einstein only relevant letters. Within a short span of time, she became aware of his likes and dislikes and understood him in a way no member of the family ever could. </P>
          <P>Einstein also acquired a calculator; well, not a machine, but a person, Walther Meyer from Vienna. A Jew by birth, he helped Einstein with his calculations with the unified theory he was developing and remained a constant companion. </P>
          <P>Einstein now shared a good relationship with his son Hans. The two exchanged letters. Hans’ letters were a mixture of love and hatred. Einstein showed interest in his studies and his plans for the future. Hans decided to become an engineer, hydraulic to be specific. He gained admission to ETH, the Alma Mater of his father. </P>
          <P>Hans fell in love with a girl called Frieda Knecht. She was nine years older than he, less than five feet tall, ordinary looking but smart. Einstein tried to prevent the marriage as his own parents had done when he married Mileva. History replayed! When it was clear that Hans would not budge, Einstein cautioned that the relationship would not last even one year. He went to the extent of advising them not to have children. </P>
          <P>The wedding took place and Hans proved his father wrong. They had children and remained together till 1957 when Frieda died. At Einstein’s suggestion, the couple also adopted a girl, Evelyn. </P>
          <P>Hans Albert Einstein, after passing out of ETH held various positions as an engineer. His wife and he migrated to USA following his father. Hans became a Professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and died on July 26, 1973. His children were Bernhard Caesar, Klaus Martin, Evelyn, and two boys who lived only a few days. Bernhard (1930–2008) was a physicist and engineer. Klaus lived only six years (1933 – 39). Evelyn (1941–2011) was an animal control and police officer. </P>
          <P>Eduard never recovered enough to lead a healthy life. He developed schizophrenia. He fancied being a poet or studying medicine to become a psychiatrist. It is interesting that Einstein met Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis and the two signed an anti-war plea. However, during their meeting, Einstein chose not to discuss his son’s illness. Interestingly enough, Eduard wanted to marry a lady who was older to him by ten years. Perhaps, some disposition in their genes! However, the marriage did not take place. </P>
          <P>Eduard’s health posed serious problems. His outbursts went out of control. At one point of time Mileva hired body guards to protect herself. </P>
          <P>Mileva presented herself, to everybody’s surprise, at Margot (Elsa’s daughter) and Dimitri Marianoff’s wedding in Berlin. Eduard had attempted suicide and she was there to seek Einstein’s help. But in vain as he was to leave for America shortly! He did not see his son at all after he developed schizophrenia. </P>
          <P>Mileva looked after Eduard till her death in 1948. Subsequently, Eduard died of a stroke in 1965, at the age of 55. </P>
          <P>Did Einstein believe in God? </P>
          <P>A good question to ask. Many great people in the world have been asked this question. They have given various answers. </P>
          <P>Einstein did not believe in the conventional idea of a God. He believed in Beauty and Simplicity. He sought beauty in an equation; simplicity in a theory. He looked for these two elements in all his works. He would often contemplate, “What was in God’s mind when he created this world (universe)?’ “If I were God, would I have created the world this way?” Who was his God then? </P>
          <P>Einstein appreciated the harmony and order that existed in the cosmos. But he could not relate this with the suffering of mankind. Expressing his personal understanding of a God, Einstein said, “I cannot think of a personal God who influences the actions of individuals.” He has also said, “I believe in Spinoza’s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings...” To a school girl he explained that every scientist is convinced that there is some spirit behind the laws of physics and the universe. This spirit is an eternal one and humbles us in every way. Therefore a scientific quest becomes a spiritual quest. </P>
          <P>At another time he averred, “I’m not an atheist and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangements of the books, but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.”</P>
          <P>Ravindranath Tagore and Einstein</P>
          <P>Einstein met Ravindranath Tagore on July 14, 1930 at his home in Caputh and once again, sometime later. Tagore, a famous Bengali poet, author, playwright and novelist who also revolutionised music in India. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his work Gitanjali. Their conversation centred on causality, truth, beauty, religion, music among a host of other topics. Detailed transcripts of their conversations are available on the internet. But doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of these records, since, it is said that they could hardly communicate because, Tagore did not speak German and Einstein was not very good in English. Tagore’s observation of Einstein- “He is a solitary man.” </P>
          <P>Second visit to America </P>
          <P>It was December 1930. After Margot’s wedding, Einstein and Elsa along with Walther Meyer set sail to America from Antwerp in Belgium; this was their second visit. Einstein’s invitation had come from the Nobel Laureate, Robert A Millikan, President of California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, in Los Angeles. Einstein was to spend a two month term as a research fellow. Millikan had experimentally verified Einstein’s equations on photoelectric effect and Brownian Motion. As a result, the institute had gained worldwide recognition, which it retains to this day. </P>
          <P>As usual there were requests for lectures and interviews. Einstein could not shun public appearances any more. He agreed for an interview with reporters on arrival in New York. The press asked questions on a wide range of topics, from his ideas about the fourth dimension to Adolf Hitler. About the fourth dimension he said, “A spiritualist will explain it better.” Could Relativity be explained in one sentence? “It takes me three days to give a short definition.” Regarding Hitler, he retorted, “He is living on the empty stomach of Germany.”</P>
          <P>Elsa also attracted the attention of the press and appeared on the cover of Time magazine. She was hailed as the lady who kept accounts and managed all of Einstein’s affairs, thus allowing him to focus on his research. She declared, “He is my life. I like being his wife very much.” She supported charities by charging one dollar for Einstein’s autograph and five for a picture with him. </P>
          <P>A surprise awaited Einstein when he visited the newly built Riverside Church in Manhattan. There stood a stone statue of Einstein amidst that of ten other thinkers. Startled, he asked, </P>
          <P>“Am I the only living one among all these people?”</P>
          <P>“Yes, professor,” said his host. </P>
          <P>“Then I will be careful about what I say and do from now onwards.”</P>
          <P>Einstein made good use of the mass hysteria that his mere presence ignited, to advocate his thoughts. He spoke to students at Caltech, addressed a rally at the train station in Chicago and the War Resister’s League in New York. He propagated antiwar ideas and advised people not to enrol for compulsory military training. After all military training teaches you to kill! Even if 2% of the population desisted from training, governments would become powerless, he declared. This declaration gained fame as the 2% comment. </P>
          <P>Einstein sailed to San Diego via Cuba where he was treated as a celebrity again. At San Diego a group of five hundred girls received him in a lavish four hour ceremony. The press was of course present. He visited California. Hollywood amused him. He even got an offer to act in a movie which he of course rejected. He toured the Universal Studios and lunched with Charlie Chaplin. A few days later, Einstein and Chaplin attended the premier of the movie The City Lights. They were greeted with applause. Charlie Chaplin commented, “They cheer me because they fully understand me; they cheer you because they do not understand you.” </P>
          <P>Einstein’s visit to the Mount Wilson Laboratory in California was important from a scientific point of view. During his work on cosmology (outlined later in the book), Einstein’s calculations had shown that our universe is unstable and contracting or expanding. He was not convinced with the outcome and had attributed it to an error of calculation. To stabilise the cosmos, he had introduced a cosmological constant. During this visit to the Mount Wilson Laboratory he learnt that there is evidence to prove that our universe is in fact expanding. His initial calculations were indeed correct and hence he withdrew the constant.</P>
          <P>When Einstein and Elsa were shown the highly advanced telescopes and what they were capable of, Elsa was least impressed. She dismissively remarked, “My husband can do all this on the back of an envelope.” </P>
          <P>As he crossed fifty, Einstein seemed to move away from science towards politics. During this tour he actively condemned war, nationalism and allied feelings. He was not just a pacifist; he was a militant pacifist, as he called himself. This sentiment was seen as anti-American by many and put the host Millikan in an awkward situation. He was successful in persuading rich philanthropists and industrialists to pump money into Caltech. Millikan was pressurised to prevent Einstein from making such statements. As a result, Millikan denounced the 2% comment of Einstein. </P>
          <P>On his way back home he checked into the Waldorf Hotel in New York. The couple were provided two separate suites and they could not locate each other! They solved the problem by locking up one of the suites. The Einsteins were seen off at the New York port by a big group of young pacifists who shouted, no war forever, as the ship set sail. He arrived in USA as a scientist and left as an anti-war hero! </P>
          <P>Thus, Einstein in his later years donned the role more of a social reformer than just of a scientist. Very few understood his Theory of Relativity yet it elevated his social and political status such that he could now make statements about war and peace and people would lend a keen ear. </P>
          <P>The League of Nations had been formed after the First World War in an attempt to prevent further warfare. Einstein followed its activities, but opined that it was a rather timid organisation, more so because he was himself in favour of aggressive attempts to end war and promote disarmament. But the organisation had only a limited agenda of arms control. </P>
          <P>Einstein was joined in his endeavour by Sigmund Freud (founding father of psychoanalysis), Upton Sinclair (famous American author) , H G Wells (famed writer of science fiction) and John Dewey (American philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer). Together they issued a memorandum and pleaded abolition of compulsory military training. There was some hope when a General Disarmament Conference co-organised by the League of Nations, USA and Russia was held in 1932 in Geneva. Einstein participated in the conference as a spectator in the visitors’ gallery. The only interesting event that occurred was that on sighting Einstein, the delegates stopped their deliberations and gave him a standing ovation! </P>
          <P>A section of the society declared Einstein a communist; he, in fact, was against any form of totalitarianism and was critical of the communist regime ravaging Russia. He sympathised with the Arabs who were being driven out of Israel. He reflected, “If we cannot cooperate with the Arabs, we have not learnt anything during 2000 years of suffering.” He even recommended setting up a joint committee of Arabs and Jews for a ceasefire. </P>
          <P>Einstein made a third trip to America in December 1931, again on an invitation by Millikan to spend two months in Caltech as a visiting professor. It seemed that spending the early part of every year in Caltech would become a permanent arrangement for Einstein. Oxford University was also contemplating on extending an invitation to him. </P>
          <P>He was stationed in rooms at the Athenaeum. A lady offered $10,000 to Caltech for a meeting with Einstein. Predictably Einstein refused! It was here that Abraham Flexner, an educator, met him over a long discussion. Flexner’s mission was to set up a centre where scholars could work freely without the pressures of teaching and administration. Flexner had received a 5 million dollar donation from Louis Bamberger who had sold a departmental store. The centre was to be named The Institute for Advanced Study and was to be located next to Princeton University in New Jersey. Einstein, Millikan and Flexner met and discussed over a long meeting. Obviously, Einstein would be a very appropriate person to head the institute. An invitation was extended; he was yet to give his consent. </P>
          <P>Did Einstein like America? Maybe he did not. He was quite disillusioned with life in America. When his friend Ehrenfest wanted to work in America and sought Einstein’s opinion, he said that life in Holland was much better. According to him there were only a few real scholars in America and life was boring. But he liked the independence and individuality that America promoted. But its materialism? No, not acceptable! </P>
          <P>The next meeting between Einstein and Flexner took place on the broad lawns of Christ Church’s Tom Quad of Oxford University while he was there on a lecture tour. A formal invitation was extended to him for an appointment at The Institute for Advanced Study. Details were sorted out in Einstein’s house in Caputh in June 1932. Among other things, his remuneration was discussed. Einstein requested $3,000 a year. Flexner was surprised that Einstein quoted such a small amount. Einstein thought he had asked an exorbitant amount. Immediately he wondered, “Could I live on less?” A sum of $15,000 was decided upon with Elsa’s intervention and other considerations. Walther Meyer was also to be appointed and paid by the Institute. </P>
          <P>The press was quick to act. The news that Einstein would move to Princeton made headlines. Randolf Frothingham, President, Woman Patriot Corporation, an influential organisation fighting pacifism, communism, socialism and other tendencies that were considered anti-American, wanted to prevent Einstein from entering America. She presented a 16 page memorandum to the US State Department describing Einstein as a pacifist and a communist. </P>
          <P>The government filed a petition and sent a copy to the US Consulate in Berlin, which was responsible for issuing Einstein the visa. The petition filed in America grew in size with time. Twenty three years later, it had become a dossier of 1427 pages. </P>
          <P>As Einstein was packing to leave Berlin for America (for a sojourn in Caltech), he received a call from the US Consulate in Berlin requesting him to attend an interview. Einstein rushed to Berlin from Caputh. The Deputy Consul conducted the interview which lasted more than 45 minutes. He wanted to ascertain Einstein’s political affiliations, to which he replied he had none. </P>
          <P>Then he was specifically asked:</P>
          <P>“What party do you belong to or sympathise with? For instance, are you a communist or an anarchist?”</P>
          <P>“What is this, an inquisition? Is this an attempt at chicanery? I don’t propose to answer such silly questions,” retaliated Einstein.</P>
          <P>He continued,</P>
          <P>“I didn’t ask to go to America. Your country men invited me, yes, begged me. If I am to enter your country as a suspect, I don’t want to go at all. If you don’t want to give me a visa, please say so. Then I will know where I stand.”</P>
          <P> Einstein grabbed his hat and coat and stormed out of the office saying, </P>
          <P>“Are you doing this to please yourselves or are you acting upon orders from above?”</P>
          <P>It was learnt later that Einstein refused to sign a declaration denying that he was a member of the Communist party. However, officials of the consulate conferred and Einstein was informed that night that a visa would be issued. </P>
          <P>Newspapers reported, “Einstein resumes packing.” He told reporters on many occasions in future that he was not a communist and that he did not favour communism in any way.</P>

          <P>Grand Unification of Forces and Einstein’s Cosmology </P>
          <P>Einstein’s quest through physics was to find a way of unifying the theories of gravitation and electromagnetism. Attempts had been made in the past but with little success. German physicist Hermann Weyl tried to extend the geometry of General Relativity to include electromagnetism in 1918. Theodor Kaluza another German physicist added a fifth dimension. Oskar Klein, Niels Bohr’s student also made an attempt. The next was Sir Arthur Eddington himself. He came very close to achieving a unification of gravity and electricity. </P>
          <P>In 1923, Einstein wrote a paper titled To Understand Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields as One. The media seemed to have been starved for some time now. There had been no news from Einstein since 1919. Hence, no sooner had Einstein’s paper become public, out came the headlines, “Einstein describes His Newest theory”, “Unintelligible to Laymen”. Einstein gave interviews and said that his aim was not limited to a unification of gravity and electromagnetism. He endeavoured to remove some of the anomalies that existed in quantum mechanics. </P>
          <P>However, he soon discovered that his arguments in this paper were flawed. In 1929 he wrote a five page paper and corrected the flaws. News spread and about a hundred journalists from all over the world made a beeline at his house on Haberlandstrasse in Berlin. Einstein had to take shelter in his doctor’s villa! The headline, “Einstein on the Verge of Great Discovery: Resents Intrusion” appeared. However Einstein gave newspaper interviews even before the paper was published. “I want to resolve the duality of natural laws into unity.” But an editor from the New York Times discovered a mathematical error in one of the equations. He received the bonus of being admitted into the house. </P>
          <P>When the paper was published, the Prussian Academy printed 1000 copies, followed by another 3000 copies; very unusual for a scientific paper. Selfridges, a department store in London pasted the paper on the window. The paper in its entirety was cabled to the New York Herald Tribune. The Wesleyan University in Connecticut bought the manuscript paying an undisclosed sum of money. The New York Herald Tribune wanted to print the entire paper. But printing the Greek letters and symbols posed a problem. Professors were employed to develop a decoding system and reconstruct the paper. The paper even provoked the interest of the American church.</P>
          <P>The public and the press are easily excitable, riding high on sensationalism; but the scientific community looks for facts, is convinced only by proof. Wolfgang Pauli, Austrian physicist felt that Einstein had ignored physics and crossed into mathematics. He relied too much on the beauty of the theory! He was sure that Einstein would abandon his theory within a year. This did happen. Einstein revised his theory in 1931 and told Pauli, “You rascal, you were correct.” </P>
          <P>The quest for a unified theory continued even after Einstein’s death. Now it is recognised that there are four fundamental forces in nature--Gravitational, Electromagnetic, Strong Interactions and Weak Interactions. </P>
          <P>Strong and weak interactions (forces) are present only within the atom. Gravity and electromagnetic forces act everywhere. The only inter-planetary force present is gravitational force that governs planetary motion and interactions.</P>
          <P>In his attempt to unify gravity and electromagnetic forces, Einstein achieved only limited success. In fact, he spent almost twenty five years trying to improve his model. The major cause of failure seems to be his non-acceptance of quantum mechanics. The search for a unified theory drove him to solitude. In the words of German biographer Jürgen Neffe, “It was his mania, mantra and martyrdom.” </P>
          <P>In 1963, Sheldon Glashow, American theoretical physicist, struck a unification of weak forces (interactions) and electromagnetic forces through the Electroweak Theory. In 1967 Abdus Salam, from Pakistan and Steven Weinberg, American theoretical physicist took this a step further with their W and Z particles. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979.</P>
          <P>Today, the Theory of Everything, TOE, still attempts unification, of gravity as well. The String Theory claims to unify the forces. But many scientists have raised doubts. The Loop Quantum Gravity tries to reconcile Relativity and quantum mechanics. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s Cosmology </P>
          <P>By 1917, Einstein had presented his theory proposing the impact of gravitation on our notion of space and time. He then extended his theory to encompass the entire universe, not just the solar system that we live in. To this end, he relied on the Cosmological Principle which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic; homogeneous to mean that it has the same properties everywhere and isotropic to mean that properties are the same in whatever direction we look. </P>
          <P>He was startled when he applied his equations to this universe. The result indicated that the universe is neither static nor stable; and that the universe must either be expanding or contracting! He was not sure which way the universe was going. Einstein consulted astronomers as it was not his area of expertise. They concluded that the stars neither approached the sun nor receded from it. But they did not realise that this is true only for our galaxy and not for the entire universe. </P>
          <P>Einstein opted for a quick fix solution to the problem. He introduced what is called a Cosmological Constant (denoted by l) into his calculations, which was nothing more than a fudging factor to align the calculations to the experimental results. The way Einstein used this factor influenced gravity on a very large scale. The constant was capable of both expanding and contracting space. The theory had the acceptance of other scientists; it had come from Einstein; so it must be correct!</P>
          <P>Alexander Friedmann a brilliant Russian scientist, working at the University of St. Petersburg, chose the same problem and took Einstein’s equations of General Theory of Relativity as the starting point. He published his results in 1922, which clearly showed how different values of Cosmological Constant yielded different models of the universe. With the constant set to zero, his study gave a model which was vulnerable to gravity’s pull. The universe was indeed, dynamic! </P>
          <P>Einstein would not accept this theory and held that the work was flawed; mathematically correct but physically not realistic. Friedmann stuck to his ideas. However, he met an untimely death in 1925.</P>
          <P>It was left for a Belgian scientist Georges Lemaitre working at the University of Louvain to continue the race. By 1927, he too discovered that the universe was dynamic. He was a cosmologist and was able to grasp the physical implications of the theory. He was convinced that the universe was expanding. According to the General Theory of Relativity, our universe is like a mattress in four dimensions called the space time continuum. It is as if this mattress is bulging day by day like a balloon. </P>
          <P>If the universe is expanding, then it becomes smaller and smaller as we go back in time. Ultimately we reach a stage when the universe collapses to a point. Perhaps our universe emerged from this point or singularity. This is the Big Bang Theory that explains the beginning of the universe. The theory says that the universe started with an explosion 13.7 billion years ago. </P>
          <P>Lemaitre and Einstein met several times and discussed the issue. Einstein also visited Mount Wilson Laboratory where he met the American astronomer, Edwin Hubble. Hubble with his 100 inch reflector telescope had made amazing discoveries. By measuring the red shift of the star spectra it became clear that the galaxies were moving away from us. Einstein was now convinced that the universe is really expanding. He confessed later, “Cosmological constant is a great blunder in my life.”</P>

          <P>Goodbye to Germany </P>
          <P>“Take a very good look at it. You will never see it again,” Einstein told Elsa as they left for America after procuring the visa in December, 1932 to honour the contract with Caltech and Millikan. Why did he make such a statement? Had he an intuition by then that he may never return to Germany? How else can we explain the thirty pieces of baggage he carried for a three month stay?</P>
          <P>It was in America that Einstein heard the most disturbing news of his life. On January 30, 1933 Adolf Hitler had taken over as the chancellor of Germany. Very soon he realised that whatever he had told Elsa when he left Caputh, was already proving to be true. He would not go back to Germany. About that time an earthquake struck Los Angeles. He felt the ground beneath his feet shake; not because of the earthquake, but because of the disturbing developments in Germany.</P>
          <P>Back in Germany, Nazis swung into action. Einstein’s apartment was raided even as Margot (Elsa’s daughter) was inside. Her husband Dimitri Marianoff was not home. But he was wise enough to instruct Margot to pass on all of Einstein’s papers to the French Embassy. She did so and joined her husband in Paris. Ilse (Elsa’s other daughter) and her husband managed to escape to Holland. Nazis ransacked the house three more times in the next two days. What they expected to find there, no one knows.</P>
          <P>Einstein could not go back to Germany. Even the German Consul in New York, Paul Schwartz, warned him against such a decision, “They will drag you by your hair if you go!” </P>
          <P>After ransacking his Berlin apartment, the Nazis vandalised his house in Caputh, which was very close to his heart. Even his boat was confiscated. When he learnt of it, Einstein remarked, “It seems I had a few visitors to honour my house when I was away. They could have come when I was there.” </P>
          <P>His stay in Caltech concluded and Einstein left America in March 1933. His destination now was Antwerp in Belgium, not Berlin. As soon as he landed, he rushed to the German consulate in Brussels and returned his German passport, and in effect his German citizenship. He also submitted his resignation to the position he held in the Prussian Academy of Science. His colleague Planck was relieved that Einstein voluntarily quit the Academy. His act of throwing away the German citizenship infuriated the Nazis. As revenge, they revoked his citizenship in the spirit of hanging a dead person!</P>
          <P>Planck paid rich tribute to Einstein in a speech at the Academy- “…(through him) physics has experienced a deepening significance which can be matched only by that of the achievements of Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton.” </P>
          <P>Meanwhile the Nazis banned Jewish teachers and students from Berlin University and confiscated their credentials. Soon Jews were disqualified from holding any official position in Germany. The Jews thus were left with no option but to flee the country. Fourteen Nobel Laureates and twenty six professors of theoretical physics, including Niels Bohr, Otto Stern, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard, fled Germany. When Planck tried to warn Hitler about the dangers of Nazi dictates and actions, the latter replied, “If by dismissing these scientists we have to do without science, we can do so for a few years.”</P>
          <P>A big rally of nearly forty thousand German patriots was held near the Berlin Opera House. The crowd celebrated the death of Jewish Intellectualism by burning thousands of books looted from libraries. They considered it an act of liberating German science from the clutches of the Jews. Philip Lenard, one of the opponents of Einstein, was jubilant as he was appointed the chief of Aryan Science in Germany.</P>
          <P>In Belgium </P>
          <P>Einstein decided to live in Belgium. He rented a house in the famous resort Le Coq sur Mer. Einstein, Elsa, Helen Dukas and Walther Meyer lived here. Meanwhile, rumour spread that the Nazis offered a price of $5000 for his head! Pointing to his head, Einstein laughed it off saying, “I did not know this was worth so much”. The local government took the rumour seriously and assigned two policemen to guard his house. When a friend, Philipp Frank, visited Einstein, the guards pounced on him! </P>
          <P>Getting a job was no problem, if only he was prepared to accept one. “I have more professorships than original ideas,” he joked. Apart from the Princeton offer, Einstein had offers from Brussels, Paris and Madrid. </P>
          <P>Another widely asked question is why Einstein did not take up a position in the Jerusalem University which he had helped establish. Apparently, he had many grievances against the university administration; formost among them was that the university had compromised academic standards in making some appointments.the administration had compromised academic standards. Further, he had developed differences with Weizmann. So when the university did extend him an invitation, he rejected it. </P>
          <P>Einstein had met Elizabeth, the queen of Belgium on one of his tours. Now that he was in Brussels, he was invited to the palace often. The queen liked music and loved to play the violin with Einstein. The two had private sessions, lunches and dinners. </P>
          <P>In Belgium, Einstein found it necessary to move away from pacifism. Now that Germany was waging war with other countries, he felt that it was appropriate for other countries to fight back. In this context, compulsory military training was perfectly in order. Einstein aired these views openly. He was after all a scientist, and a scientist can change his opinion as and when new evidence comes up!</P>
          <P>Another instance that exhibits Einstein’s shift from pacifism to militarism is when the Belgian government had jailed two persons who had desisted military training. Pacifists everywhere were agitating for their release. The king wanted to exploit the good relations Einstein shared with the queen. Einstein was requested not to support the pacifists or press for their release. He readily accepted and also released a statement to that effect. </P>
          <P>He wrote to the leaders about his departure from pacifism. Newspapers gave wide publicity and his friends were outraged. Romain Rolland fumed, “Einstein is brilliant in science, but indecisive and inconsistent outside of it.” </P>
          <P>Adieu to son and Mileva</P>
          <P>Einstein learnt that Eduard’s mental illness had become worse and that he had been confined to an asylum near Zurich. His friends insisted that he pay a visit. He visited Eduard and two played the violin.</P>
          <P>Mileva was well aware that Einstein could not return to Germany. She was generous enough to invite Einstein and Elsa to live in her apartment. From Zurich Einstein went to Oxford to keep an engagement. Little did he realise that he had seen Mileva and Eduard for the last time. </P>
          <P>The lecture in Oxford was followed by one in Glasgow and then Einstein returned to Belgium but not for long. He made another trip to England. During this visit he met Winston Churchill who was then a member of the Opposition in the British Parliament. Germany’s disarmament featured in their talks. He also met the former Prime Minister Lloyd George. After the meeting Einstein was requested to sign in the visitors’ book. In the Address column he wrote ohne (meaning, without in German). The MP who had hosted Einstein mentioned this in his speech to the Parliament. He also expressed that it was indeed England's good fortune to offer Einstein shelter at Oxford. Einstein’s visits to Oxford were slated to become a regular feature. </P>
          <P>Einstein lost Ehrenfest, a dear friend in the most tragic circumstances. Ehrenfest was separated from his wife, who lived in Leiden. His son suffered from Down’s syndrome. During a visit he shot his son in the face; the son lost his eyes. Later Ehrenfest shot himself. Einstein had lost a sincere friend whom he had helped in many ways. Einstein felt unnerved; added to his trepidation was the rumour of Nazi conspiracy. </P>
          <P>England seemed safer; he travelled again to London. He addressed a gathering of more than nine thousand people in the Royal Albert Hall. He appears to have spoken in English and stressed the need to protect intellectual and individual freedom, “Without such freedom, there would have been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, no Newton, no Faraday, no Pasteur, and no Lister.” </P>

          <P>To America For Good </P>
          <P>The ocean liner Westmoreland carried an important family on October 7, 1933 to New York. It started from Antwerp, where Elsa and Helen Dukas boarded, and stopped at Southampton in England to pick up Albert Einstein and Walther Meyer. It was a one way trip. They did not return to Europe. The ocean liner arrived in New York on October 17. </P>
          <P>Reporters waited to have a word with him and for a photo opportunity, but in vain. Flexner had tricked them all. He had arranged Einstein and others to disembark on to a small tug boat. They were whisked away in a waiting car straight to Princeton. Flexner had also forbidden Einstein from giving interviews and making statements. </P>
          <P>As soon as he landed, the first thing that Einstein did was to buy ice cream at a corner shop! Instead of his poor English, he used sign language to communicate. He pointed his thumb at a customer who had just bought it and then pointed it at himself. The sales girl must have felt it to be the greatest moment in her life.</P>
          <P>The Institute of Advanced Study was housed in Princeton University and had eighteen visiting scholars. John Von Neumann, a forerunner in the area of computer science in USA, was a resident at the Institute. Alan Turing, known for his pioneering work in computer design and encryptology in Britain joined a little later. Turing is known for his contribution to cracking the German code during the war. Whether Turing and Einstein communicated with each other is not known. </P>
          <P>While equipping his office, the one special item Einstein requested was a large waste paper basket. “I make many mistakes,” he remarked.</P>
          <P>His interest in music continued and he became acquainted with noted violinists Toscha Seidel and Fritz Kreisler. He regularly played with small groups of musicians. When school girls visited them, he entertained them by playing on his violin. </P>
          <P>His neighbours slowly grew accustomed to his eccentricities; he ignored ordinary things in life to concentrate on more important issues. His hair was unkempt; a tie, optional; and socks were not required. Age was on his side. He remarked jocularly, “One advantage of being old is that you do not have to wear socks when others ask you to.”</P>
          <P>Like Millikan at Caltech, Flexner at Princeton had to temper Einstein’s public utterances. Einstein was at the mercy of America and the Americans. None of his actions or words must displease them. Any pacifist statements, pro-Jewish utterings or anti-war sayings could land him in trouble. Once, a few boys from Einstein Science Club in a local school met him at his house. While talking to them, Einstein opined that there was no anti-Semitism in America. The teacher accompanying the students informed the local newspaper about it. The editor made it a headline. </P>
          <P>Flexner was infuriated. He requested and pleaded Elsa to ensure that Einstein made no such statements. To make matters worse, Einstein had agreed to perform in a music recital in Manhattan to raise money for Jewish refugees. Flexner tried to stop his performance. There was a feeling that giving too much publicity to Jews could provoke anti-Semitic feelings. Ignoring all warnings Einstein performed at the concert. </P>
          <P>Flexner took matters into his own hands now. He started intercepting Einstein’s mail. He replied to a few of them himself without Einstein’s knowledge. One such was an invitation from President Roosevelt. The president had invited Einstein and Elsa to visit him in the White House. Flexner sent a letter of apology that read thus: “Einstein is here to carry out some scientific work in seclusion and does not like him to be brought to public notice.” When he learnt of this, Einstein at once wrote to Roosevelt explaining the situation. In fact, Einstein was waiting to meet Roosevelt hoping it could help the Jewish cause in America. The president’s wife Eleanor herself made a telephone call to Elsa and extended an invitation. In January, 1934 Elsa and Einstein met the president in the White House and spent the night there. </P>
          <P>Einstein complained bitterly about Flexner’s censorship to an official; in the letter he mentioned his address as, Concentration Camp, Princeton! After this incident the relationship between Flexner and Einstein worsened. </P>
          <P>Ever since he left Germany he was haunted by the one very existential question: where to strike roots? In April, 1934 Einstein chose Princeton above Oxford, Caltech and Madrid as his abode for the rest of his life. The next logical step was to obtain an American citizenship. President Roosevelt had expressed his willingness to make a special provision to immediately naturalise Einstein and his family. But Einstein preferred the routine procedure. </P>
          <P>Elsa’s daughter Ilse was sick. She had been diagnosed with leukaemia and her condition was critical. She had moved in with her sister Margot who lived in Paris. Elsa rushed to Paris; Einstein stayed back. Ilse died on June 10, 1934. A devastated Elsa left Paris with a small quantity of Ilse’s ash packed in a bag. Elsa collected Einstein’s papers from the French Consulate which Margot had handed over when the Nazis had ransacked his house in Caputh. </P>
          <P>112 Mercer Street </P>
          <P>In the summer of 1936 Einstein moved to a modest wooden house at 112, Mercer Street and remained there till his death. Displaying no extraordinary architectural features, the house accommodated a living room with German furniture at the ground level, and a library and study at the second. A large desk, like the one in Berlin, big bookcases and an easy chair formed Einstein’s furniture in the study. As before, portraits of Maxwell, Faraday and Newton decorated the walls. A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi whom Einstein revered was an addition. A dog, a cat and a parrot completed the family. </P>
          <P>Einstein did not drive. He walked to his office. The neighbours found this interesting. Walter Isaacson gives a very detailed account of Einstein’s routine. </P>
          <P>In the morning after a bubble bath came a big breakfast with at least two eggs. He would then walk to the institute. He would stand in front of a blackboard with his assistant, Meyer or Leopold Infeld and start writing equations. He preferred German speaking assistants as his communication skills in English were limited. One of his students joked that he had an English vocabulary of 300 words. One of his favourite expressions was, 'I will a little tink'.</P>
          <P>At midday, Einstein would walk home with a few colleagues, discussing, arguing about some scientific issue or the other. When they reached 112, Mercer Street, his companions would drift away in the direction of their houses. Einstein would stand in front of his house for a while. Sometimes, he would simply go back to work! If Helen Dukas was watching from the house, she would come out and drag Einstein inside and force him to eat lunch, usually macaroni. He would then respond to his mail and work on problems of interest. He used to receive a large number of fan mail. </P>
          <P>Several amusing anecdotes connected with Einstein are available; many of which may even be fictitious.</P>
          <P>He walked a lot in Princeton but was absent minded. Once, the dean’s secretary received a call. The dean was not available. The caller asked the secretary for Einstein’s address. The secretary informed that policy did not permit her to give out addresses to strangers. Then to the secretary’s surprise, the caller whispered, “I am Einstein. Don’t tell anyone. I have forgotten my address!” </P>
          <P>Walter Isaacson in his biography of Einstein refers to an incident at a dinner party hosted in honour of Einstein. After the preliminary introductions, it was Einstein’s turn to speak. There was a thunderous applause. Scribbling some equations on a piece of paper, he did not seem to take note of the proceedings. Helen Dukas nudged him to get up. He did and still did not realise that he had to deliver his speech. Seeming quite lost, he too started clapping! </P>
          <P>Einstein is known to have written many letters of support to Germans who wanted to migrate to America. He offered them financial help and wrote certificates and testimonials when requested. In this regard, Infeld has jested, “Everyone has a certificate from Einstein!” </P>
          <P>Einstein and School children</P>
          <P>Einstein interacted with school children many a time. Once, an eight year old girl approached Einstein in his house and asked for help in arithmetic. She had brought some fudge as fees for the lesson! Einstein helped her out and offered some cookies. When the incident came to light, the girl's parents apologised to him. In all humility he replied, “I have learnt as much from her as she has learnt from me!”</P>
          <P>Two other girls were treated with a lunch of baked beans when they came to him for help in math. Einstein consoled a little girl who complained that mathematics was a ‘big problem’ for her with the words, “Don’t worry; my problems are greater than yours.” </P>
          <P>Recorded is also an interesting incident about Henry Rosso, a 15 year old boy, from the Princeton High School. A student of journalism, his teacher had challenged him that an interview with Einstein would fetch him an A Grade. Henry accepted the challenge. </P>
          <P>With the milkman’s help Henry learnt the time Einstein would leave home for work and succeeded in tracking him. Surprisingly, Einstein agreed to give an interview. But to his dismay, Henry did not know what questions to ask. Einstein himself suggested questions related to mathematics and answered them! The interview, it was made clear, was for the purpose of the assignment only. Yet, somehow the press laid hands on it. </P>
          <P>Elsa dies</P>
          <P>Einstein lost Elsa in the year 1936. She was bedridden with kidney and heart ailments. A change of place was deemed necessary for her to recoup. Accordingly, Einstein and Elsa moved to a cottage at Saranac Lake near New York, but her health further deteriorated and she died on December 30, 1936. No mathematics or physics could help him; Einstein wept once again. Following Elsa’s death he returned to work with his face ashen. He found it difficult to concentrate. </P>
          <P>Maja now moved in with Einstein. Hans Albert arrived in Princeton and found work soon enough. After changing a few positions, he became a professor at the University of California in Berkeley. Eduard had to remain in Europe due to health concerns. Mileva found it increasingly difficult to take care of him. She sought the help of her sister Zorka, who was an alcoholic herself. All that Zorka managed to do before her death was to literally burn all the family money which Mileva had hidden in the oven!</P>
          <P>EPR Paradox</P>
          <P>Einstein was involved in another controversy connected with quantum mechanics. It was found that under certain circumstances pairs of particles with the same quantum state could emerge. The surprising feature is that the two particles need not be physically proximate; they may even be a universe apart. Obviously, Einstein not very convinced of this phenomenon called it Spooky Action at a Distance. With the help of his assistants Podolsky and Rosen, he published a paper called the EPR Paper and ridiculed quantum mechanics. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s argument seemed realistic to many. But Wolfgang Pauli and Heisenberg were annoyed; so was Niels Bohr. Bohr gave it a serious thought and wrote a rebuttal which was longer than Einstein’s paper and showed where he had gone wrong. Schrodinger, a scientist was on Einstein’s side; he even congratulated Einstein on the EPR paper. He called this spooky action, Entanglement (Verschränkung). </P>
          <P>Einstein had clearly lost the battle. The EPR debate did not end with him. Experiments and observations continued and have proved the validity of entanglement and consequences of the Copenhagen Interpretation. Considerable research is in progress even today to apply these concepts to everyday life. High-end research is being conducted in the areas of quantum information theory, superdense coding, quantum teleportation, quantum computing, quantum crystallography and quantum cryptography.</P>

          <P>The Bomb Story </P>
          <P>E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> was a discovery in fundamental physics exploring the relationship between mass and energy. Little had Einstein fathomed the possible consequences of his discovery. A young man in Prague had already hinted at one phenomenal extension of the theory, which he had completely dismissed. </P>
          <P>Niels Bohr visited Princeton with the news that scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman in Berlin had discovered a process to split an atom into two to release energy, which later came to be called nuclear fission. After Niels Bohr gave a talk in Princeton about this discovery, it led to a lot of related research in USA. Even at this juncture Einstein did not pay much attention. </P>
          <P>However, he was drawn into this area of work very soon and the person responsible was Leo Szilard, a physicist from Budapest, whom Einstein knew from his Berlin days. Szilard had since made his way to New York and was now engaged in research to create a chain reaction, at Columbia University. Having discovered uranium to be a suitable element, Szilard shared this knowledge with Eugene Wigner, another physicist from Budapest. They conjectured that the Germans may attempt to build a bomb using the chain reaction phenomenon, and that they might source uranium from the Belgian Congo through Belgium. Congo housed the world’s largest deposits of uranium. So, they concluded that it was imperative to alert Belgium about this possible misuse of uranium. They decided that Einstein, who shared cordial relations with the Belgian royal family, could warn them. The Queen with whom he had played violin a while ago was the Queen Mother now.</P>
          <P>The two raced to meet Einstein in 1939. But he was on a holiday sailing at Nassau Point near the village of Peconic Long Island. A young boy helped them locate Einstein. They explained their mission to Einstein. He understood the implications in a matter of fifteen minutes and agreed to write to a Belgian minister, with whom he was acquainted. Wigner felt that this may not be a wise move, considering that all three of them were refugees and any attempt to communicate with a foreign country might be misunderstood. They decided that Einstein should write to the Belgian ambassador in America, and intimate the same to the State Department. A letter was drafted. An official in the White House who was to deliver that letter to the State Department suggested that Einstein write to the president himself. </P>
          <P>Einstein wrote a revised letter to the President of the United States of America which read –</P>

          </P>
          <P>
            <em>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable </em>
            <em>through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard </em>
            <em>in America - that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain </em>
            <em>reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of </em>
            <em>power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would </em>
            <em>be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be </em>
            <em>achieved in the immediate future.</em>
          </P>
          <P>
            <em>This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction </em>
            <em>of bombs, and it is conceivable - though much less certain - that </em>
            <em>extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. </em>
            <em>A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, </em>
            <em>might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the </em>
            <em>surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well </em>
            <em>prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</em>
          </P>
          <P>
            <em>The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in </em>
            <em>moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the </em>
            <em>former Czechoslovakia. While the most important source of </em>
            <em>uranium is Belgian Congo. In view of the situation you may think </em>
            <em>it desirable to have more permanent contact maintained between </em>
            <em>the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain </em>
            <em>reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be </em>
            <em>for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence </em>
            <em>and who could perhaps serve in an unofficial capacity. His task </em>
            <em>might comprise the following:</em>
          </P>
          <P>
            <em>a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed </em>
            <em>of the further development, and put forward recommendations for </em>
            <em>Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of </em>
            <em>securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States;</em>
          </P>
          <P>
            <em>b) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being </em>
            <em>carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, </em>
            <em>by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts </em>
            <em>with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this </em>

            <em>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of </em>
            <em>uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken </em>
            <em>over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps </em>
            <em>be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-</em>

          <P>
            <em> (Albert Einstein)</em>
          </P>
          <P>The letter was sent through Alexander Sachs, an economist, who was well-known to the president. It took almost two months for him to meet the president. Realising its importance he preferred to read out the letter to the president who at once understood the implications. Nazis might blow up America, he thought. </P>
          <P>An ad hoc committee was formed. Einstein was not involved; neither did he want to be. However, Szilard and Wigner were on the committee. Einstein received a reply from the president informing him that a board had been formed. A sum of $6000 was allotted for the project which however moved at snail’s pace. On Szilard’s request, Einstein wrote to the president appraising him the urgency of the matter. The Germans might succeed first. President Roosevelt called for a meeting immediately and urged that the project be hastened. It is not clear whether Einstein was invited, but he did not want to attend. </P>
          <P>By May 1940, the war was in full progress. Germans had captured Holland and Belgium and France had surrendered. Britain stood alone. Then Germany invaded Russia. </P>
          <P>These developments made way for the well-known Manhattan project. Ironically, Einstein could not be a part of it. The Chief of Staff of the project, Brigadier Miles wanted a security clearance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) before allowing Einstein to play an active role. The FBI went through all the records they had about Einstein including the petition that had been filed by Mrs. Frothingham, that he be not given a visa to enter America. The records declared him a communist and a pro-Soviet. Einstein thus was considered a security risk, not to be trusted as a loyal citizen!</P>
          <P>Einstein a Citizen of America</P>
          <P>It is interesting that in the middle of all this activity Einstein wrote a citizenship test in June 1940 and earned the eligibility to become a citizen of America. The ceremony itself took place in October when Einstein, Margot and Helen Dukas became naturalised citizens. </P>
          <P>Manhattan Project </P>
          <P>The Manhattan Project was launched on December 6, 1941. The very next day Japan bombed Pearl Harbour. Many people Einstein was closely associated with, including Szilard, Wigner, Oppenheimer and Teller, worked on this project. Einstein did not have firsthand knowledge of the progress of the project. However he was consulted on a few technical matters such as the separation of isotopes, the manner of placing mines in harbours etc. He was paid $25 a day for his services. </P>
          <P>Though he did not participate in the Manhattan Project, Einstein did contribute substantially to the war efforts. He auctioned the manuscript of the Special Relativity paper. Since the original was not available, Einstein dictated it to Helen Dukas who typed it out. This paper and another unpublished paper together fetched a total of $11.5 million dollars, which he donated to the War Bond drive. </P>
          <P>As the project progressed, it became clear to the participating scientists that the weapon they were creating was deadly and would change the nature of future warfare. One such scientist, Otto Stern met Einstein and sounded caution. On this occasion, Einstein decided to write to Niels Bohr.</P>
          <P>The gist of the letter that Einstein wrote to Niels Bohr was that the scientists should pressurise political leaders to bring about an internationalisation of power. </P>
          <P>Bohr had made a substantial contribution to the Manhattan Project. He had shown with his Liquid Drop theory that only one particular form of uranium could be split by bombarding it with a neutron. This was experimentally verified. Further Lise Meitner and others had computed the amount of uranium needed to cause an explosion. All this knowledge was made available to the Manhattan project. It appeared that the bomb would have been made whether Einstein wrote that letter to the president or not. In fact, the bomb, essentially a product of nuclear physics, would have been made even without the formula E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>. </P>
          <P>In March, 1945 the war was in the final stages. Szilard was in Princeton again to meet Einstein. He posed a big question. Germany was near defeat and had not progressed in making a bomb. If America succeeds in making one, who will be the victim? Japan? The very thought was dreadful.</P>
          <P>Another Letter to Roosevelt</P>
          <P>The meeting with Szilard prompted Einstein to write another letter to President Roosevelt. He stressed the need for communication between scientists and policy makers at this stage. He urged Roosevelt to speak to Szilard and other scientists. </P>
          <P>The letter did reach Roosevelt but he did not read it. According to a French movie on Einstein, Roosevelt told his secretary that he would read the letter tomorrow. But the tomorrow never came. Roosevelt was dead the same night. The letter was shown to Harry Truman, the next president who merely passed it on to the Secretary of State James Byrnes who was not impressed by the letter.</P>
          <P>Rest is history. The bomb was made and dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Three days later, it was Nagasaki’s turn. When Einstein heard the news, he cried in despair, “Oh, my God!”</P>
          <P>Once again Einstein was on the covers of magazines and front pages of newspapers. “The Man who Started It All”, proclaimed one newspaper. Einstein for his part could only lament. “If only I knew that Germans were not at it, I would not have written to the president,” he regretted. It was an added grief for him. He admired the Japanese greatly, and only a few years earlier, he had enjoyed their hospitality. Now it was as if he was responsible for the misery that the bomb had caused.</P>
          <P>Thus sp0ke Krishna</P>
          <P>America tested the bomb in a desert in New Mexico before dropping it on Japan. J Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist well known to Einstein was the head of the project. Watching the bomb explode he exclaimed and thought of Krishna’s words in the Bhagavad Gita. </P>
          <P>Divi soorya sahasrasya bhaved yugapadutthitaa</P>
          <P>Yadi bhaah sadrishee saa syaad bhaasastasya mahaatmanah (11.12) </P>
          <P>If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky, that would be like the splendour of that Mighty One.(The Cosmic or the Universal Form).</P>
          <P>The splendour of the Cosmic Form excels all others; it is indeed beyond comparison.</P>
          <P>Einstein in a meeting with Oppenheimer criticised the bomb-building exercise as a weapon of mass murder. Oppenheimer quoted Krishna from Bhagavad Gita -- </P>
          <P>Sri bhagavanuvaacha</P>
          <P>kaalo’smi lokakshayakritpravriddho</P>
          <P>lokaan samaahartumiha pravrittah</P>
          <P>ritepi twaam na bhavishyanti sarve</P>
          <P>ye’wasthitaah pratyaneekeshu yodhaah (11.32) </P>
          <P>Sri Bhagavan said</P>
          <P>I am the mighty world-destroying Time now engaged in subduing the world. Even without you, none of the warriors arrayed in the opposite armies shall live.</P>
          <P>This is often quoted in books in the form - “I become death, the destroyer of worlds”. Evidently, Oppenheimer took shelter under Krishna who makes the world and also breaks it. </P>

          <P>What Next? </P>
          <P>Einstein found himself in a very difficult situation. After the fame and glory of having achieved a breakthrough in physics, he was now extremely perturbed for being wrongfully held responsible for the construction of the bomb. Extremely repentant for the way things had shaped up, Einstein felt it was time to act. Observing the enormity of the damage the bomb had caused in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he concluded, very rightly, that if there would be a third world war it would be fought with atomic weapons and the fourth with stone!</P>
          <P>Einstein formulated grand political and social ideas just like he did in physics. He proposed the idea of a World Government; a super power, above all individual governments, to regulate building and possession of weaponry. He rationalised that if America, Britain and Russia would join hands, other like-minded countries would soon follow. He opined that America should reveal the bomb secret to this consortium of countries, which would result in no single country possessing the knowledge and thus break the monopoly over it. </P>
          <P>Grand, indeed. Perhaps Einstein was not politically shrewd enough to understand the impracticality of his idea. Soon enough he also realized that it was almost impossible to enter into any agreement with Russia. On the one hand he was trying to unify the forces in nature and on the other unify the countries of the world. </P>
          <P>During a dinner to commemorate Nobel, Einstein perceived a similarity between himself and Nobel. He was indirectly responsible for the bomb, which caused large-scale destruction and was now advocating peace. Nobel ironically had made lots of money building the dynamite and then awarded Nobel peace prizes. </P>
          <P>The Emergency Committee for Atomic Scientists was formed with Einstein as Chairman and Szilard as Director. The committee proposed a two-pronged agenda – formulation of a World Government and Arms Control. Einstein allowed his name to be used freely for he was aware that it worked in attracting influential people and donations. </P>
          <P>USA and Britain participated in arms control; but Russia did not. A cold war ensued between the West and Russia rendering any understanding impossible. But Einstein continued to insist that Moscow should somehow be involved in these ventures. </P>
          <P>Einstein was critical of the hysteria about communism and Russia that was fast rising in USA. He deemed it very dangerous. He openly opposed the anti-Red fever and felt that America was trying to curtail freedom of expression. Any statement opposing this view was treated as anti-American even though the constitution allowed for free speech. Rather than live in such a country as a scientist or a teacher, Einstein felt that he should have been a plumber who could freely express his views. The result was that the Plumbers Association admitted him as a member and sent him a membership card! </P>
          <P>In reality, Einstein was against the authoritarian rule of the communists in Russia. He refused invitations from Russia and condemned Russia’s misuse of veto power in the Security Council. But there were attempts in America to brand him a Soviet supporter. A congressman went to the extent of saying that Einstein misused his stature of a Nobel-winning scientist to promote communism. </P>
          <P>Einstein, at times, seemed to behave in a contradictory manner. A movement in America urging scientists to stop research work on building atomic weapons had started. Einstein surprisingly did not support the movement stating that until Russia obliged to disarmament, there was no point in America doing so. </P>
          <P>President Truman initiated a program to build the Hydrogen Bomb, which Einstein did not fully endorse. He made a television appearance expressing concern over the Government’s increased security measures which compromised the rights of people. Around this time Klaus Fuchs, a German scientist was identified as a Soviet spy and arrested. Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed in his famous speech that he possessed a list of card carrying communists working in the State Department. Thus began the Era of McCarthy or McCarthyism that lasted about five years. The hysteria against communism was further fanned. Suspicion and false accusation became the order of the day. Careers were ruined, arrests were made and people committed suicide. An estimated ten thousand people lost jobs on the grounds that they did not cooperate with the anti-communist movement. </P>
          <P>Against this background, Einstein had denounced the making of the H-bomb. Papers announced, “Disarm or die, says Einstein.” Einstein’s position on the H-bomb issue angered Eleanor Roosevelt (wife of former U.S President Roosevelt) and former U.S President Hoover. They ordered an FBI report about Einstein’s communist connections. The report listed thirty four organisations with which Einstein apparently had connections but concluded that he was no security risk. Interestingly, the FBI had been gathering information about Einstein ever since he joined Caltech in 1932. The result was a whopping 1427 pages stored in fourteen boxes! </P>
          <P>Communication with Jawaharlal Nehru</P>
          <P>Einstein sought international support for the establishment of a Jewish state, which later became Israel. Among others, he wrote to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India. Einstein sent him a four page letter on June 13, 1947. India became independent two months later and Nehru had already been nominated prime minister. The letter praised India for its progressive thinking and abolition of untouchability, and requested Nehru’s support. However, India’s sympathies were with the Arabs. India opined that Palestine belonged to the Arabs and the Jews were trying to take it over. Accordingly, Nehru wrote a reply explaining India’s stand. It is not known whether Einstein replied at all.</P>
          <P>However, Nehru paid a personal visit to Princeton to meet Einstein on November 5, 1949. Indira Gandhi (Nehru’s daughter who later became India’s Prime Minister) and Vijayalakshmi Pandit (Nehru’s sister; Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union and President of the General Assembly of the UNO) were also present.</P>
          <P>He is a Communist!</P>
          <P>Einstein supported only justice and not any particular political party or principle. The Rosenberg affair was one such issue that prompted Einstein to take a stand. American citizens of Jewish descent, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were arrested in 1950 on the charge of passing atomic secrets to Russia. Ethel’s own brother, to save his skin, had given statements against the couple. However, in 2001 he confessed to have lied.</P>
          <P>In 1951, the couple were sentenced to death. As the day of execution approached, demonstrations were held all over the world including Paris, Rome, London, Moscow, Prague, Warsaw, New York, Washington and Toronto. Noteworthy people such as Picasso, Sartre and even Pope Pius XII supported the protests. Einstein on his part wrote a letter, condemning the verdict to the judge, Irving Kaufman, who did nothing but hand it over to the FBI. The letter was only filed in the FBI dossier. Einstein wrote directly to President Truman himself. Since Truman was stepping down from office, the letter ended up with the next President, Eisenhower. He would not yield; the Rosenbergs were executed. </P>
          <P>Americans were enraged with Einstein’s active intervention and wrote angry letters in the press – “You have put the Jews first and then America”, “Go to Russia or where you came from”, “You need some common sense”. </P>
          <P>About the same time, Stalin in Russia had put on trial nine Jewish doctors for allegedly plotting to kill some leaders. Einstein joined hands with other scientists and sent a petition to Stalin asking the release of the doctors. They were freed, but only after Stalin’s death.</P>
          <P>The other person whom Einstein helped was Albert Shadowitz, a professor of physics who had been a member of the communist party and helped a union which was later banned because it included communist members. Shadowitz sought protection under the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution. He requested Einstein’s help. Einstein supported the cause and allowed Shadowitz to use his name freely. Another case involved the African-American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois. On the first day of the hearing, it was announced that Einstein would give evidence in favour of the scholar. The judge dismissed the case! </P>
          <P>Even Oppenheimer, Head of the Manhattan Project and Director of the Institute of Advanced Learning was not spared. He had made enemies for denouncing the H bomb. Besides, his wife and his brother were once members of the communist party. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) contemplated stripping him off his security clearance. Oppenheimer was prepared to face the commission and answer its questions. Einstein felt that Oppenheimer should not have undergone such humiliation. AEC decided that he was a security risk and he lost his security clearance a day before it would have naturally expired! </P>
          <P>The next logical question was whether Oppenheimer should be allowed to continue as the Director of the Institute of Advanced Learning. Einstein and others strongly supported his retention as Director. Oppenheimer saved his position. </P>
          <P>Gandhiji’s Passive Resistance </P>
          <P>Einstein had the greatest respect for Mahatma Gandhi. He was visibly moved when the latter was assassinated on January 30, 1948. He lamented, “Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.”</P>
          <P>Where there is injustice, Einstein decreed, people should not cooperate. If one is called to give a statement or evidence in support of a biased government, he urged, “Do not cooperate”. He preached Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of passive resistance and recommended non-cooperation to William Fruenglass, a teacher who had to testify before a Senate Committee examining the communist influence in high schools. </P>
          <P>There was uproar in the press. “How disgraceful you look without a haircut and a Russian wool cap”, “You are a menace to the country”, “You escaped from a communist country to have freedom, don’t abuse it.” </P>
          <P>Senator McCarthy was quick to react. “Any one advocating noncooperation in such matters is an enemy of America”, he declared. Bertrand Russell fully endorsed Einstein’s advice in a letter. Flexner who had retired by then also supported Einstein. </P>
          <P>Eventually, Oppenheimer’s enemies, Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the AEC and Edward Teller, with whom he had had a row over the development of the H bomb, were put to shame. McCarthy began to lose his popularity and in 1954 he met his own disgrace brought about by President Eisenhower, the U.S. Army and others, who eventually denounced his anti-communist propaganda. However, Einstein had preserved his integrity and his freedom of speech. There is always a difference between a politician making a lot of noise and a humanist fighting for a legitimate cause. </P>
          <P>Would he go back to Germany? </P>
          <P>Einstein was particularly happy when the Lincoln University, a black institution, conferred upon him an honorary degree. He had detested the prevalent racial discrimination in America. He again expressed his disapproval of capitalism. He felt that it made people selfish; encouraged students to study courses to make money; and discouraged creativity. He envisioned a planned economy which guaranteed universal employment and a home for the citizens of the country. </P>
          <P>After the war in 1946, Einstein was invited to re-join the Bavarian Academy, which he refused, saying, “The Germans have slaughtered my Jewish brothers; I will have nothing to do with them.” In 1949, he was called to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (now called the Planck Institute). He again refused. In 1951, he was asked to join the peace section of a Prussian organisation. He wrote, “Because of the mass murder that Germans inflicted upon the Jews, it is evident that a self-respecting Jew could not possibly be associated in any way with any official German institution.”</P>
          <P>Politics is for the present; equations are for eternity</P>
          <P>Einstein retired from the Institute of Advanced Study when he turned sixty-six. Nevertheless, like most retirees from the universities, he retained a small office and went there almost every day. Though now a political figure, he still worked with his equations to unify the forces in nature, for according to him, “Politics is for the present; equations are for eternity.”</P>
          <P>During this period he enjoyed the company of many well-known scientists. One among them was the Director of the Institute, Oppenheimer. Another important visitor was Kurt Gödel, a mathematician from Vienna known for his Incompleteness Theory. He was also a migrant in America like Einstein and showed interest in concepts such as Time Travel and Relativity. The two became very good friends. </P>
          <P>Einstein’s main interest at this stage in life was focused on the unification of forces. He believed that gravity and electromagnetic forces could be explained by the same set of equations. He collaborated with Wolfgang Pauli in this pursuit for some time. A solution still eluded him. In 1949, a new edition of The Meaning of Relativity was published, which included an appendix detailing his latest work on unification. </P>
          <P>The media jumped with joy hoping for a breakthrough. The New York Times proclaimed, “New Einstein Theory Gives Master Key to The Universe”. Einstein learnt within six weeks that he was wrong. In 1951 he declared, “The unified theory has been put to retirement.” </P>
          <P>One surprising fact is that even at this stage Einstein did not accept quantum mechanics completely. He would say, “I may be wrong but I have earned a right to make mistakes.” At the same time he ridiculed quantum mechanics saying, “Does the observation by a mouse change the state of the universe?” </P>
          <P>Tobacco Stealer </P>
          <P>A very interesting incident happened when Niels Bohr visited Princeton. He was writing a paper which involved Einstein’s research. Bohr at one stage found it hard to continue. At such moments he would repeat words till he found a clue. Now Bohr, saying, “Einstein, Einstein … “, kept roaming about the room. He also called a colleague for help. The two were in the room when Einstein (his office was on the floor above) came in. His mission was to steal some tobacco as he was not allowed to buy it (by his wife and doctor). When suddenly Bohr turned around, all three were surprised. Laughter broke out.</P>
          <P>Mileva Dies </P>
          <P>Mileva’s health deteriorated, so did her financial situation. Eduard’s illness was a black hole that sucked all her money. The funds deposited from the Nobel Prize money had diminished in value due to inflation. She had sold two of her apartments. In 1948, Einstein succeeded in selling the third, the proceeds of which went directly to her. </P>
          <P>One wintery day Mileva slipped and fell while she was walking on the road. This fall turned out to be a prelude to her death three months later. Frieda, Einstein’s daughter-in-law found a sum of 85,000 Swiss francs, proceeds from the sale of the third apartment, under the mattress in Mileva’s apartment. Mileva had saved this money for Eduard’s treatment. Freida also found a bundle of letters, apparently correspondence between Einstein and Mileva.</P>
          <P>Eduard, Einstein’s second son from Mileva, was left alone in Zurich now. Einstein promised to take care of him at any cost. </P>
          <P>Einstein himself did not enjoy good health now. In 1948, an aneurysm in his aorta was diagnosed. As is true even today, rupture of an aneurysm is fatal. Of course, there are procedures today to prevent its rupture. But way back in 1948 there were none, which meant, death could knock on Einstein’s door anytime! </P>
          <P>Maja, separated from her husband was living with Einstein now. She suffered a stroke in 1948 and was bedridden. The only way Einstein could comfort her was by reading to her. Maja died in 1951. Now it was left to Margot to take care of Einstein.</P>
          <P>Presidency of Israel</P>
          <P>Though Einstein supported several cultural and political aspects associated with Israel, he had disliked some of the events that had unfolded there. He could not understand the violent military methods adopted by leaders such as Menachem Begin. He would have liked a more friendly approach on the part of the Israel government. </P>
          <P>Israel’s first President Chaim Weizmann died in 1952. Incidentally, it was he who had compelled Einstein to make his first trip to America to garner funds for the Jews. Thereafter, there was intense public pressure to elect Einstein as the next president of Israel. The Prime Minister Ben-Gurion agreed to approach Einstein. The newspapers had another heyday. The government of Israel appointed Abba Eban, the Ambassador of Israel in Washington to approach Einstein with an invitation. Einstein tried to make a phone call to the ambassador to reject the offer. But formalities required that the ambassador meet Einstein and officially invite him. An official from the embassy did meet Einstein in Princeton. But even before the invitation was handed to him, the rejection letter had been placed on the table!</P>

          <P>Last Days</P>
          <P>During his last days Einstein was plagued by stomach related ailments and anaemia. But he was aware that the aneurysm in his aorta could end his life any moment. He felt that human existence was brief like a fleeting visit to a strange house; similar to the Indian philosophical perception of life. He kept contact with Habicht and Solovine, erstwhile members of the Olympia Academy. He took walks with Godel sometimes and with Margot at other times. Margot observed that he had mellowed down and that his judgement had turned mild. He became very friendly with Hans Albert and exchanged letters with him. </P>
          <P>He remained a good friend of Bertrand Russell. The two agreed to come up with a public declaration urging countries to find peaceful means to resolve all matters of dispute. Nine other scientists including Max Born agreed to be a part of the drafting committee. The declaration called the Einstein-Russell declaration was ready by April 11 , 1955 and Einstein signed it. </P>
          <P>His academic life continued and he clung to his passion – unified field theory. His friends and other great scientists of the time laughed at him. They knew very well that he would not succeed. But he would not give up. His assistant Bruria Kaufman, a physicist from Israel would fill the blackboard with equations as per Einstein’s latest thinking, only to wipe it out clean. </P>
          <P>Johanna Fantova was his companion now; she has recorded many of his day to day activities and thoughts. The two shared a very good friendship for nearly twenty five years. </P>
          <P>He celebrated his seventy-sixth birthday. Soon after, his closest friend for sixty years Michele Angelo Besso died. Lamented Einstein, “For us the physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion.” </P>
          <P>After signing the Einstein-Russell declaration he received the Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban at 112, Mercer Street. Einstein was to deliver an address over radio to the people of Israel on the seventh anniversary of the formation of Israel. He made coffee for Eban and told him that the real test of Israeli people is in how they treat the Arabs. </P>
          <P>Two days later, at noon, Einstein collapsed in the bathroom. His aneurysm perhaps had started to rupture. The doctors suggested surgery. He refused any attempts to prolong his life. His situation worsened in the following days and he had to be admitted to the hospital. He would wake up and ask Helen Dukas to fetch him paper, pencil and his glasses. He talked to Hans Albert who had flown down from California. Showing his equations he remarked, “If only I had more mathematics!” He talked to Otto Nathan (a German refugee and a close friend) about Germany. One of the last to see him alive was Margot who also happened to be admitted in the adjacent ward, in the same hospital. She said that it was indeed impossible to recognise him; his appearance had changed so much. He, it seemed, was ready for death. He told her, “I have accomplished what I came to do here.” </P>
          <P>His death came shortly after one O’ clock in the morning of Monday, April 18, 1955, at the age of 76. Apparently, he said something in German before dying. The nurses could not decipher it. At his bedside were two documents. One was the speech he was to deliver on radio for Israel which began thus: “Today I speak to you not as an American citizen, not as a Jew, but as a human being.” The other was a bunch of twelve pages of equations related to the Unified Theory. What he left at his bedside when he died, was symbolic of what he stood for in his life. </P>
          <P>He was cremated the same afternoon even before most of the world came to know of his death. He had wished for a simple cremation and only twelve people including Hans Albert and Helen Dukas were present at the funeral ceremony in Trenton. Further Einstein had wished that no memorial be built for him and that his ashes be dispersed in the River Delaware. He was sure that if his ashes were retained, they would be stored in someplace, which itself would become a memorial. But the following words are in fact a memorial to him. </P>
          <P>Dear Posterity,</P>
          <P>If you have not become more just, more peaceful and generally more rational than we are (were) – why then, the Devil take you. Having, with all respect, given utterance to this pious wish,</P>
          <P>I am (or was) Yours</P>
          <P>Albert Einstein (1936)</P>
          <P>What was in his brain?</P>
          <P>A formal autopsy was conducted by Dr. Harvey. Suspecting that there was something special in his brain, Dr. Harvey cut open Einstein’s skull and took the brain out, apparently for research. Hans Albert tried to complain in vain. For Dr. Harvey, this was a once in a life time opportunity; he would not desist.</P>
          <P>Dr. Harvey preserved Einstein’s brain till 1998. By then he had taken many slices of the brain and supplied them to various hospitals for further research. Nothing positive has come out of this endeavour. One person who expected some good result was Evelyn Einstein. It may be recollected that at Einstein’s suggestion Hans Albert had adopted her. She had grave suspicions that she was indeed Einstein’s own daughter. In fact, following Elsa’s death Einstein had relationships with many women and it is alleged that she was born out of one such liaison with a New York dancer. Evelyn had hoped that a DNA analysis would solve the riddle. But to her disappointment, the manner in which Dr. Harvey had mangled the brain, it was impossible to extract DNA from it. </P>
          <P>It was thus a futile exercise. To put it in the words of Jürgen Neffe,“The key to understanding Einstein lies not in biology but in biography.” </P>
          <P>Helen Dukas</P>
          <P>Helen Dukas was Einstein’s secretary from April 13, 1928 till his death. She managed all his correspondence. Einstein used to joke, “She is the one that tells the world that I am living. She writes all my letters.” She shielded Einstein from journalists. After Elsa died, Helen Dukas became his house keeper and cook. Following Einstein’s death, she ensured that almost all of the 42,000 items belonging to him in the form of papers, letters, passports and certificates were preserved for posterity. Einstein had left her his personal belongings and $20,000. He had also left for her a fraction of the royalties he received for his writings. She lived in 112, Mercer Street till her death in 1982, at the age of 87. Otto Nathan remarked, “Einstein died for a second time.”</P>
          <P>Preserving the documents</P>
          <P>Whatever Helen Dukas preserved is now a property of the Princeton University Press. </P>
          <P>The library at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem holds about 80,000 items including letters, memos, sketches, drafts, manuscripts and rough calculations. The California Institute of Technology also holds a number of similar items.</P>
          <P>The Einstein Museum in Bern is indeed a treasure trove. It exhibits Einstein’s papers and letters, and books that influenced him. Animated representations of his theories for the common man are very interesting. His apartment in Bern has been converted into a museum and it houses many photographs. </P>
          <P>Who knew Einstein personally?</P>
          <P>This is a very interesting question. The book My Einstein edited by John Brockman contains the writings of many modern scientists on Einstein. The one by Lee Smolin is particularly interesting for it shows how elusive Einstein the person was, even to people who were very closely associated with him. He was a post doctorate fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. Smolin made an attempt to discover Einstein, the person. He met a number of people and asked them – What was Einstein like as a person? The replies were absolutely puzzling. The great physicist Freeman Dyson said, “I am very sorry, but that’s one thing I can’t help you with.” Einstein’s biographer, Abraham Pais did not give an answer to this question, but introduced Smolin to Helen Dukas. She said, “Can’t help you. I was just the secretary. I only typed the papers.” Nor could Peter Bergmann, one of Einstein’s assistants, be of any help. Smolin never found out who Einstein was!</P>
          <P>That is the mystery of the man. He was associated with hundreds of people, but he was detached from them. He does not seem to have engaged himself emotionally with anybody. Elsa and his mother Pauline perhaps were the exceptions. “He did not like to be constricted and he could be cold to members of his family”, writes Walter Isaacson. His own collaborator Leopald Infeld says, “His heart never bleeds and he moves through life with mild enjoyment and emotional indifference. His extreme kindness and decency are thoroughly impersonal and seem to come from another planet.” In the words of Max Born, “For all his kindness, sociability and love of humanity, he was nevertheless totally detached from his environment and the human beings in it.” Perhaps it was this attitude that helped him undertake adventures in science and fight till his goal was reached. In fact Einstein himself confesses, “Man is at one and the same time a solitary being and a social being.”</P>

          <P>A Brief Description of Einstein’s Contributions</P>
          <P>Photoelectric Effect </P>
          <P>The Photoelectric effect, discovered by Hertz in 1887, refers to the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces when light shines on them. To better understand Einstein’s contribution to this phenomenon, let us look at how the theory evolved. It all started with Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) who gave us the theory of optics and showed that white light is composed of seven colours. He proposed the Particle Theory of Light or the Corpuscular Theory of Light which states that light is made up of particles. This is typically a mechanical view of the universe. Christiaan Huygens (1629 – 1695) proposed that light is made of waves. Thomas Young (1773 – 1829) conducted the famous experiment in which light was passed through a narrow slit. An interference pattern was observed supporting the wave theory of light. James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) a Scottish physicist pioneered the unification of electricity, magnetism and optics in his Electro Magnetic Theory. He proposed that these three seemingly unrelated fields were in fact manifestations of the same phenomenon – the Electromagnetic Field. This theory influenced Einstein to a considerable extent and supported the wave theory of light. Coincidentally, Einstein was born the same year that Maxwell died. </P>
          <P>In 1900, Max Planck (1858 – 1947) made a very important observation. He was studying the relationship between the intensity and frequency of radiation from a black body, and the temperature of the body. A black body is an object that is a perfect absorber of radiation. He found that energy radiated in chunks or packets. To be more specific, energy is a multiple of a constant, the actual formula being, E=hn<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>, where n is the frequency. Planck found the value of h to be 6.626x10 <SPAN><Sup>-34</Sup></SPAN> Joules seconds. Plank however did not realise the importance of his work. For him h was only a mathematical factor to complement his experimental observations. But later it became an important concept in physics and came to be known as Planck’s Constant.</P>
          <P>It was up to Einstein to synthesise all this information and make a bold hypothesis. Einstein reasoned that if energy comes in small packets called quanta, then the same should also be true of light. Here again energy is represented by h multiplied by frequency. Light therefore should consist of small particles or photons. Planck’s observations relating to black body radiation, should also be true for the photoelectric effect.</P>
          <P>Frequency of light became an important parameter. If photons have high frequency, energy released is also high; if the frequency is low, energy released is low. How about intensity of light? What role does it play? The more the intensity, the more the number of electrons knocked out of the surface of the metal. Greater intensity does not mean that electrons travel faster. </P>
          <P>Einstein had thus not just explained photoelectric effect; he had also made a contribution to the theory of light. Is it a particle? Or is it a wave? Clearly light exhibited a dual character. It was both a particle and a wave. </P>
          <P>Determination of Size of Molecules </P>
          <P>Einstein’s work on the size of molecules has a bearing on Amedeo Avogadro’s (1776-1856)hypothesis that states, “Equal volumes of samples of ideal gases at the same pressure and temperature have the same number of molecules.” The estimate for this number, called the Avogadro number is 6.02214x10 23. </P>
          <P>Einstein extended this hypothesis to liquids. He considered sugar solution and worked through its viscosity. He came up with two equations, one for the size of sugar molecules and the other for their number in water. He calculated a value of 2.1x10 23 for the Avogadro number, obviously too small. A few years later, one of Einstein’s students traced the cause of error and obtained a fairly correct value of 6.56x10 23. This research did make him Dr. Einstein and has found practical application in areas such as cement mixing and dairy production. </P>
          <P>Brownian Motion </P>
          <P>In 1828, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown observed the zigzag motion of pollen grains in water. The answer to why and how the particles took to zigzag motion in a liquid medium had eluded scientists for nearly eighty years. </P>
          <P>Was it due to the interaction with water molecules? One explanation was that individual water molecules hit the pollen particles thus setting them in motion. This was clearly impossible as the particles were a few thousand times bigger than water molecules. Einstein was convinced that collision with one water molecule would not cause this motion. But millions of collisions occurring from different directions could cause the zigzag motion. He argued that these collisions when made from one side of the particle would set it in motion in one particular direction; the next series of collisions occurring from another side of the particle would change the direction of its motion. Einstein was quick to realise that there were two processes involved -- diffusion of particles inside a liquid and movement of particles or migration. He had already studied diffusion of sugar molecules in water. He combined the two effects and came up with a formula for Brownian Motion.</P>
          <P>It may be mentioned that Einstein was neither interested in Brownian Motion nor was it his mission to explain it. He was more concerned with thermal molecular motions of a micro scale within a liquid which could produce motion at a physically visible macro scale, and Brownian Motion was an illustration. </P>
          <P>Indirectly, Einstein provided evidence to validate the molecular theory which had by then been propounded. The importance of his evidence is clear in Einstein's words – “My main aim ..was to find facts that would guarantee as possible the existence of atoms of definite finite size ...The (experimental verification of the) statistical law ... of the Brownian Motion .. coupled with Planck’s determination of true molecular size from the law of radiation ... convinced the sceptics, who were quite numerous at the time of the reality of atoms.” These sceptics included the famous scientists of the time, Wilhelm Ostwald (the professor to whom Einstein had written seeking apprenticeship and who had later nominated him for the Nobel prize) and Ernst Mach. </P>
          <P>Thus, we see that Einstein was never interested in simple problems with limited scope. His enquiry was always into the heart of the matter. Phenomena such as Brownian Motion were only consequences. </P>
          <P>Special Theory of Relativity</P>
          <P>Einstein wrote his fourth paper in 1905 on the Special Theory of Relativity. A majority of the educated population in the world is aware that the theory was formulated by Einstein. But very few have really understood it. </P>
          <P>Entitled 'On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies', the paper was submitted to the journal Annalen der Physik on June 30, 1905. It is amazing that Einstein wrote this paper within fifteen weeks of writing the one on photoelectric effect. He also completed his doctoral thesis and wrote a paper on Brownian Motion. </P>
          <P>Relativity and relative motion are not difficult to understand. We experience relative motion in daily life. When we stand on the footpath and watch a car travelling at 60 km/h, we observe its motion. The car appears at a distance, comes closer and moves away from us. On the other hand, for the driver in the car, the observer on the footpath appears to be moving. If we watch the same car from inside another car which is also moving at 60km/h in the same direction, the car appears stationary. So in the first case, the car is moving at 60 km/h relative to a stationary observer on the footpath. In the second case, each car is stationary relative to the other. But relative to an observer on the footpath each is moving at 60 km/h. Moving trains provide a similar experience. For a commuter on the platform, the train appears to move. For a passenger seated in the train, the platform seems to move. We have all felt a sense of being stationary when our train is moving at a fixed speed and another train travels parallel to our train at the same speed and in the same direction.</P>
          <P>We would have experienced the concept of relative speed at some point. If two cars are moving in the same direction, one at speed A and the other at speed B, then we say that their relative speed is A - B. When the speeds are equal, the relative speed is zero. So each car appears to be stationary, relative to the other. But to a person on the footpath, the cars are moving, each at speed A. When the cars are moving in opposite directions the relative speed is A+B. Thus the experience of very high speed when two trains approach each other from opposite directions. There is no way to determine who is moving and who is at rest. Movement and rest of an object are always relative to the movement and rest of another object. </P>
          <P>Einstein proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905. It is so called because it refers to objects in uniform motion (constant speed) without acceleration. Acceleration means change of speed either in magnitude or direction, or both. The simple examples we considered above belong to this class. When we start and accelerate our car, the car starts at zero speed and acquires running speed in a few seconds. We say that the car is accelerating. A ball which is thrown from a height is subject to the earth’s gravitational field and experiences a force. Its speed changes with time and hence it is not uniform motion. Einstein extended his theory to include acceleration, which came to be known as the General Theory of Relativity. We shall consider it later.</P>
          <P>In 1905, the term Relativity was not new to science. Galileo, in 1632, spoke about it in his famous Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Imagine a person who travels sitting in the cabin of a ship moving at uniform speed. There may be a few flies in the cabin. A passenger may have a bowl with water and fish. The movement of the fish, the flies and the passenger will continue in the same fashion as if the ship were at rest. The passenger cannot determine if the ship is moving or is at rest. This is the essence of the Theory of Relativity as explained by Galileo. </P>
          <P>Speed of Light </P>
          <P>Speed of light plays an important role in Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It may be recalled that he often fantasised about, “what the world would look like if I rode on a beam of light?” He complemented his fantasy with the collective knowledge about light and motion that had evolved till then. Einstein had mastered this knowledge and was preparing for a long time. His extraordinary insight and genius played a prominent role and the Theory of Relativity was born. </P>
          <P>We have already briefly discussed the contributions made to optics by Newton, Huygens and Maxwell. While Newton promoted the particle theory of light, Huygens promoted the wave theory. Maxwell synthesised all this information to prove that electricity, magnetism and light are all forms of energy. He also showed that all electromagnetic radiation travelled at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second, i.e. 300,000 km per second. </P>
          <P>Since sound required a medium to travel, it was assumed that light also required a medium to travel. Sound travelled through air; what medium would light travel through? Scientists believed that a substance called ether filled the universe through which light propagated. Some scientists performed experiments to determine if ether really existed. They theorised that the speed of light would depend upon whether the observer moved through ether towards its source or whether he moved away from its source. Hippolyte Fizeau, a French scientist carried out a study in water, but his conclusions never came out into the open.</P>
          <P>Two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, are credited for their conclusive study on the non-existence of ether in the earth’s atmosphere. They are known for the famous experiment they conducted in Cleveland, USA in 1887. They split a light beam and sent one part back and forth to a mirror placed in an arm in the direction of Earth’s motion. The other part was sent in a perpendicular direction. The two parts were later combined. If the speeds of the two parts were different the resulting image should have shown interference fringes. Surprisingly no interference patterns were observed. This led to the conclusion that the speeds of the two split beams of light were the same. More importantly, it confirmed the absence of ether. No such substance existed! </P>
          <P>That seems to be the turning point for Einstein, if we go by his statement, “Inability of Michelson and Morley to detect ether prompted me to come up with the Theory of Relativity.” Of course, we should remember that he has given many confusing, and often conflicting statements in this regard. </P>
          <P>After much thought and deliberation, Einstein came up with a very bold hypothesis. He proposed that the speed of light did not depend upon the motion of its source. Any observer, therefore, independent of his own motion, measures the same value for the speed of light, c. Note that a particle theory of light or the presence of ether as a medium will not validate this hypothesis. Einstein, who had propounded the particle theory in his work on photoelectric effect, now upheld the wave theory. </P>
          <P>The Theory </P>
          <P>It is time to define an Inertial Frame of Reference. When we describe motion we define it with respect to coordinates x, y and z. Usually, it is understood that the corresponding x, y and z axes are fixed in space. Consider the example of a train or an aeroplane moving at a uniform speed. Then, we may fix the x, y and z axes to the car or the train or the aeroplane. These are called Inertial Frames of Reference. Newton’s Laws of Motion are valid in both the fixed and the moving frames of reference.</P>
          <P>The first postulate of the Special Theory of Relativity states that, “Laws of nature are the same for all inertial frames of reference.”</P>
          <P>The second postulate concerns speed of light and states, “Speed of light has the same value in all the inertial frames and is independent of the velocity of the observer or the source.”</P>
          <P>The consequences of these two postulates when considered individually appear to be very simple; but together, they are enormous. Scientists were familiar with the first postulate. The second postulate had also become common knowledge. The consequences of the two postulates when taken together rejected our commonly held beliefs of space and time. The usual manner of adding or subtracting two velocities did not work as far as propagation of light was involved. </P>
          <P>Time Dilation, Length Contraction, Twin Paradox and Loss of Simultaneity are some of the consequences of the Special Theory of Relativity. Let us examine them one by one. </P>
          <P>Time Dilation</P>
          <P>Consider a spacecraft in uniform motion at a speed of v metres per second. Beam a light pulse from the floor to the ceiling of the craft. The pulse traces a trajectory BA. Let the height of the ceiling be 4m from the floor. What is the time taken by the pulse to reach the ceiling? This is straightforward calculation. It takes 4/c seconds. Here c is the speed of light expressed in metres per second. </P>
          <P>Now consider an observer, such as a mission control official, who observes from outside the craft and is at rest. His experience is different. He, of course watches the pulse travel to the ceiling. But by the time the pulse hits the ceiling, the space craft itself has moved horizontally. The path of the pulse according to him is not BA, but CA. To simplify the argument let us say that CA is 5m. Therefore the observer on the ground concludes that the time taken by the pulse is 5/c seconds. Recall that c is the same for everyone. </P>
          <P>One can easily find a correlation between the two times. Let us denote the time as observed by a passenger in the spacecraft as tp and that observed by the ground observer as tg. Note that ABC is a right angled triangle. Pythagoras theorem tells us that </P>
          <P>AC<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>= AB<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>+ BC<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN></P>
          <P>These distances are calculated as products of speed and time. Therefore, (ct<SPAN><Sub>g</Sub></SPAN>)<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> = (ct<SPAN><Sub>p</Sub></SPAN>)<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> + (vt<SPAN><Sub>g</Sub></SPAN>)<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN></P>
          <P>On simplification we get,</P>
          <P>When we consider the usual speeds we encounter, v is very small compared to c (300,000 km/sec). As a result the term within the square root sign in the above formula is almost 1 and the two times are almost equal. When we consider a motion which is closer to the speed of light the difference between the two times becomes noticeable. This phenomenon is called Time Dilation.</P>
          <P>The question is – Does the passenger in the spacecraft feel this effect? The answer is NO. Since the craft is moving at a uniform speed, no effect of motion is felt inside. It appears that all the processes inside the craft are reduced by the same ratio. This refers to the clocks inside, electronics, the very aging process of the passenger etc. As a result, the passenger in the space ship does not experience any change. </P>
          <P>What happens when one travels at the speed of light, i.e., v = c? According to the formula we have derived above, tp becomes zero. Time stands still! The astronaut will live forever. </P>
          <P>Is this all fact or fiction? Are we entering the realm of science fiction? Not at all. This is a fact. Scientists have performed experiments to prove that Time Dilation actually does take place. The subatomic particle called Muon has a lifespan of only 2.2x10-6 second. Thereafter, it becomes unstable and breaks into smaller particles. CERN the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, based in Geneva, Switzerland, (CERN houses particle accelerators and related equipment for carrying out high energy research) conducted an experiment in 1977 where muons were made to travel repeatedly in a circular orbit of 14 metres diameter at a speed of 0.9994c. Their average life span was observed to be 29.3 times longer than that for muons at rest. Substitute a value of 0.9994 for v/c in the above formula,</P>
          <P>Many such experiments have proved beyond doubt the occurrence of Time Dilation as per the derived formula. Some of the experiments that are routinely performed in the accelerators have proven the validity of the formula. </P>
          <P>One question that arises is – Who is right? Is it the passenger in the spacecraft or the observer on the ground? Well, both are right. This points to the fact that there is no concept of absolute time. It is relative. In fact, the observer in the spacecraft, if he observes any phenomenon occurring on the ground, will conclude that the clock on the ground is running slow. </P>
          <P>Twin Paradox</P>
          <P>The phenomenon of Twin Paradox is an extension of Time Dilation. Imagine twins A and B. A being adventurous travels to space in a space ship that travels at uniform speed. In other words, it is in an inertial frame of reference. B is happy to stay home. A spends, let’s say, 25 years in space and returns home. A time period of 25 years for B on earth may only be 10 for A (who is moving in the spaceship) depending on the speed of movement. Thus, upon his return home, A finds that B has aged, while he has remained young. Imagine him travelling at speeds close to that of light. If he travels at the speed of a muon, as in the CERN experiment, he has aged only a year! This phenomenon is called Twin Paradox. However, it is only a theoretical paradox.</P>
          <P>Length Contraction </P>
          <P>A spacecraft travels to a distant planet. Let the distance between earth and the planet be s. We now have two times – tp for the passenger in the craft and tg for the observer on the ground. The passenger’s recorded time is shorter and he might conclude that he has arrived too soon. Why? We can work this out through simple math. The velocities and the time taken are known. So it is the distance that needs careful examination. Let us write these simple formulas. </P>
          <P>For the passenger,</P>
          <P>For the observer on the ground,</P>
          <P> s<SPAN><Sub>g</Sub></SPAN> = vt<SPAN><Sub>g</Sub></SPAN></P>
          <P>From these two equations we obtain, </P>
          <P>So, it appears, that to the passenger in the spacecraft the distance itself has contracted by the amount shown in the formula. The distance too becomes relative. This phenomenon is called Length Contraction. </P>
          <P>Now, let us consider a person flying from New Delhi to New York, covering a distance of 11,700 km. This is the distance measured at rest. Let us calculate the length contraction for an aircraft flying at a speed of 900 km/hr. By applying the above formula, the length contracts by a factor of 0.99999, i.e., distance reduces to 11,699.833 kms. This contraction of distance is however negligible and of no major consequence. So at speeds we encounter in everyday life, including flying in Boeing 777 or an Airbus, we do not notice any length contraction. We need to travel at speeds comparable to that of light to experience considerable length contraction. At a speed of 150,000 km/sec (half the speed of light) the distance becomes 10,132 kms. If we travel with a muon which moves at a speed of 0.9994 x300000 =299,820 km/s the distance between New Delhi and New York reduces to 405 kms. Therefore, length, i.e., distance is relative based on the speed of the observer. It is not the same for all observers. If one owns a plot of land measuring 100m x 40m, the sizes are true only for stationary observers. A moving surveyor will obtain a different value. </P>
          <P>Now the question is - where do such speeds occur? Why should we be concerned about effects of such high speeds? We do not have to go too far. Looking into an atom is sufficient. Many subatomic particles travel at speeds close to that of light. In studying these particles it becomes necessary to consider the relativistic effects. Another application which needs to factor in the consequences of Relativity to achieve high level precision data regards location of objects is the GPS system. The GPS system receives signals from satellites which are moving at high altitudes and high speeds. So, next time you use your GPS to guide you to some address, you are depending upon the Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Loss of Simultaneity </P>
          <P>Common sense suggests that two phenomena which occur simultaneously in one frame should do so in all frames of reference. The Theory of Relativity contradicts this assumption. </P>
          <P>Let us go back to the spacecraft example. Let there be two torches at the centre of the craft as shown. Let two pulses be fired - one in the direction of motion and the second in the direction opposite to that of motion of the spacecraft. One of them travels towards the rear end of the craft while the other travels towards the front end. Consider a passenger in the craft. To him the two pulses reach their targets simultaneously. How does the observer on ground perceive this situation? He finds that the rear end of the craft is rushing to meet the pulse while the front end (of the craft) is running away from it. Evidently, the pulse hits the rear end ahead of time while the pulse traveling towards the front end, much later, for the craft has moved since the pulse was fired. The effect gets exaggerated if the space craft travels at speeds comparable to that of light. Clearly simultaneity is lost. </P>
          <P>The question – Are these phenomena really simultaneous? – can hardly be answered. It depends upon whether you are in the space craft or standing on the ground. There is no absolute truth.</P>
          <P>However, a change in frame of reference cannot change the order of events. Consider this succession of events; a boy falls in front of a bus; the bus runs over him. Could there be some frame of reference wherein the events are reversed? Such that, the bus moves forward and the boy falls later? This scenario is impossible. If this were to happen, it would violate another important rule – Nothing can travel faster than light. It is the cosmic speed limit. If this were to be possible, then we would be able to travel to our past or our future! But let us not forget that there are places in some distant galaxy and to reach those places, light takes many, many years. If someone is living in those places, he will be seeing our past! Relativity is not associated with this phenomenon. </P>
          <P>Thus, the Special Theory of Relativity questions our common sense and challenges our built-in beliefs about the absoluteness of space and time. Newton supported our belief. Space was fixed while time was like a river that flowed ceaselessly at a constant rate. Einstein showed that both space and time are relative. Does it mean that we should discard Newton’s theory? Not really. His theory is sufficient for most of our calculations of speeds that are slower than that of light. Relativistic effects are essentially high speed effects. </P>
          <P>In an article he wrote to The Times of London, Einstein said, “Let no one suppose, however, that the mighty work of Newton can really be superseded by ( Relativity) or any other theory. His great and lucid ideas will retain their unique significance for all time as the foundation of our whole modern conceptual structure in the sphere of natural philosophy.” </P>
          <P>As mentioned earlier the Special Theory is valid for motions at uniform speeds. The question that arises is, “How about accelerating motion?” Einstein answered this question, 16 years later with his General Theory of Relativity. </P>
          <P>Speed of Light is the ultimate</P>
          <P>Science fiction is fond of travelling either to the future or to the past implying the possibility of faster than light travel. Is this possible at all? Can we move to a time before we even existed? It seems impossible. British physicist Russell Stannard’s discussion on this subject is interesting. According to Stannard, this speed limit (that nothing can travel faster than light) is true only for the types of matter currently available to us. </P>
          <P>There is some indication of the existence of matter which can allow speeds greater than c. Particles which travel faster than light are called Tachyons. Italian scientists in 2011 claimed that particles called Neutrinos can travel faster than light. However, their study remains inconclusive. E C G Sudarshan (Indian theoretical physicist and Professor at the University of Texas) has contributed considerably to the theoretical work on Tachyons. He has been credited with contributions to theoretical Physics in the areas of Optical coherence, Sudarshan-Glauber representation, V-A theory among others.</P>
          <P>E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN></P>
          <P>Einstein’s theory leads to the concept that energy of motion is associated with mass. Consequently we can define a rest mass, m0 as the mass associated with matter at rest. The Relativity Theory supports the deduction that we cannot have mass without energy and vice versa. The question is what do we associate with m0? Russell Stannard’s elaborate discussion on this matter is interesting. This rest mass is associated with a locked up energy which is represented by E = mc<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN>, where E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. Einstein wrote to his friend thus:</P>
          <P>“... Relativity principle, together with Maxwell’s equations, requires mass to be a direct measure of energy contained in a body. Light carries mass with it. With the case of radium there should be a noticeable reduction of mass.” Thus a large amount of energy is available within a given mass of any substance. How can this subatomic energy be harnessed? The two processes by which energy can be harnessed are - nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. </P>
          <P>Nuclear fission is the commonly used method to build atomic bombs. Some elements have a large unstable nucleus, which can be split into smaller nuclei. This process of splitting the nucleus into smaller nuclei, electrons and light pulses is called Fission. One such element with a large nucleus is an isotope of Uranium called <SPAN><Sup>235</Sup></SPAN>U. When its nucleus is bombarded by a neutron, it absorbs the neutron to become <SPAN><Sup>236</Sup></SPAN>U, which, however, is very unstable and splits to form Krypton <SPAN><Sup>92</Sup></SPAN>Kr and Barium <SPAN><Sup>141</Sup></SPAN>Ba. In the process, three neutrons and large amounts of energy are released. These neutrons, in turn, bombard the available <SPAN><Sup>235</Sup></SPAN>U and let loose a chain reaction, which releases tremendous amounts of energy. When the same reaction is controlled and harnessed, energy can be generated for power production. Nuclear fission produces large quantities of radioactive waste, disposing which has been a serious concern, as it remains active for many years to come. </P>
          <P>Fusion is the process by which two smaller nuclei combine to form a bigger nucleus. The sum of energies of the two small nuclei is greater than that of the combined nucleus. The differential energy is released in the form of heat and light. The energy thus released is far greater than the energy released during fission, and thus is more destructive and dangerous. Hydrogen bomb is constructed using the fusion technology. This is also the process that converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 million tons of helium every second in the sun. The loss of 4 million tons of rest mass every second, accounts for the tremendous energy of the sun.</P>
          <P>Fusion is an attractive proposition to produce energy. The fusion of deuterium (2H, also called Heavy Hydrogen) and tritium (3H), the two isotopes of hydrogen produces a large amount of energy. These isotopes are found abundantly in seawater. A gallon of seawater is estimated to contain energy equivalent to 300 gallons of petrol. The advantage of fusion is that it does not produce dangerous waste products as in fission. However, the big disadvantage of fusion is that it requires very high temperatures of the order of ten million degrees Celsius to occur. </P>
          <P>So far we have discussed only the conversion of mass into energy. What about the conversion of energy into mass? Such conversions occur in particle accelerators, where particles are accelerated to high energy levels and allowed to collide. New particles, initially not present, are created after the interaction. An energy deficit is observed which is accounted for by the mass of the new particles. Pions and muons are among the new particles that are generated. The study of such particles and such phenomena falls into the realm of High Energy Physics or Fundamental Particle Physics. This is an area that studies speeds close to that of light. Consequently, Relativity is the underlying principle here. </P>
          <P>General Theory of Relativity</P>
          <P>Here we will discuss some basic aspects of General Theory and some of its interesting consequences. </P>
          <P>It certainly is an exaggeration to say that when Einstein put forward his General Theory, only three people in the world understood it. Nevertheless, it is a complex theory for the common man to fully comprehend. </P>
          <P>So far, we have understood that the Special Theory of Relativity limited itself to systems moving in an inertial frame of reference; in other words systems moving at uniform speed. The adjective special was appended to it because it is only a special case of the General Theory. In General Theory of Relativity, Einstein considers systems that are accelerating; i.e., systems whose velocity may change in magnitude or direction. </P>
          <P>Galileo and Free Fall</P>
          <P>Galileo conducted an experiment in 1589 in which he dropped objects of different weights, such as spheres and feathers, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He expected each of them to hit the ground at the same time. He performed another experiment in which he rolled spheres of different weights down an inclined plane and measured the distance and time taken by the spheres to hit the ground. The experiment showed that the motion on an inclined plane had constant acceleration that depended only on the angle of the plane, and not the mass of the rolling body. </P>
          <P>In his Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment, Galileo had not considered the influence of air resistance on the outcome. But today it is possible to conduct such an experiment in a spacecraft where air resistance is absent. Experiments conducted in Apollo 15 mission, confirmed that a feather and a hammer would touch the floor at the same instant. </P>
          <P>Galileo’s inclined plane experiment did establish that given a point in space where an object has some velocity, its subsequent motion is independent of the internal structure, composition or mass of the object, provided it is subject only to the gravitational force. This phenomenon is called the Universality of Free Fall, which was established long before Einstein. </P>
          <P>Gravity and acceleration</P>
          <P>What is the relationship between gravity and acceleration? Let us perform a thought experiment. Imagine a lift which is stationed on the ground. Let a ball be dropped inside the lift from near the ceiling. Pulled down by gravity, the ball falls to the floor with acceleration equal to g. This is shown as condition (a) in the figure. Now, imagine the lift to be taken away into space where there is no gravity. The ball does not fall down and remains near the ceiling as indicated in condition (b). Let us now connect a rocket to the lift and accelerate it upwards. There is no gravity. But the acceleration imposed by the rocket makes the ball drop in an opposite direction. In other words, the effect of acceleration and that of gravity are the same (condition (c)). In fact, a = g. </P>
          <P>Now imagine that the lift is brought back to a gravitational field and is dropped from the top of a building or a hill. The lift and the ball are accelerated downwards equally by gravity. Consequently, as shown in d, the ball does not drop to the floor of the lift. An observer within the falling lift experiences weightlessness. In other words, it is free fall. Thus, conditions (a) and (c) are equivalent; so are conditions (b) and (d). </P>
          <P>The experience of the astronauts in a spacecraft which is under a free fall due to the influence of earth’s gravity is similar to (b) or (d). </P>
          <P>Hidden within Newton’s theory is the belief that acceleration is absolute. By careful analysis and his audacious questioning of common sense, Einstein showed that even acceleration is relative. In 1907, he proposed the Theory of Equivalence, according to which, no internal experiment can reveal any difference between a small accelerated laboratory in space and a companion laboratory on the gravitational earth. This gives rise to the Weak Equivalence Principle, which implies that motion under acceleration and gravity are equivalent. This takes us back to Galileo and his experiment. Galileo stated that the velocities attained by two bodies dropped from a height are the same, irrespective of their size and mass. In other words, they reach the ground at the same time. Einstein generalized Galileo’s observations. </P>
          <P>In effect, the equivalence principle allows us to swap acceleration and gravity. We can study effects of gravitation by employing acceleration and vice versa. </P>
          <P>Effect of Gravity and Acceleration on Time</P>
          <P>To understand better the effects of gravity and acceleration on time, let us perform some experiments. Consider a spacecraft which is stationary. Let there be a source of light on the floor sending pulses towards the ceiling at a frequency f. When the spacecraft is not moving, the pulse hits the ceiling at the same frequency, namely   f.</P>
          <P>Now, let the spacecraft accelerate and start moving upwards. We find that the pulse starts with a frequency f, but by the time it completes its mission, the ceiling is moving away with a velocity v. This phenomenon is called the Doppler Effect, whereby the received frequency f’ is lower than f. The resultant shift in frequency is called the Doppler Shift. Thus, the observer near the ceiling on the spacecraft concludes that the emitted frequency is lower than f. This phenomenon is known as Gravitational Redshift, whereby the indicated frequency has moved towards red in the spectrum. Einstein discovered this in 1911. Now imagine a clock that is built on the basis of these pulses, i.e., a clock that measures time by counting the number of pulses received. Then, an observer near the ceiling of the craft would think that the clock on the floor is running slow. </P>
          <P>If there is Gravitational Redshift, there should also be a Gravitational Blueshift. This occurs when the pulse that is travelling and the pulse’s destination part of the craft are approaching each other. Assume that the pulse is generated at the ceiling and it travels to the floor. Then an observer on the floor measures a higher frequency than f. </P>
          <P>This leads to the conclusion that in a gravitational field the clock which is at a lower altitude runs slower. In fact, it is time itself that has slowed down. </P>
          <P>Does it read like science fiction? Well, experiments have been performed to verify these effects. Russell Stannard lists a number of such experiments in his book. The first evidence of redshift came from a study of spectra emitted by the white dwarf stars. In 1960, scientists at the Princeton University measured the redshift for light emitted by the sun. Measurements have been made with neutron stars which have a mass 1.4 times that of the sun, but a diameter of only 10 kms. Thus, the gravity that they exert is enormous. In 2002, a shift of 35% frequency was measured. </P>
          <P>Scientists have also flown atomic clocks in aeroplanes to verify the frequency shift. Of course, in these measurements, allowance was made for time dilation itself (refer Special Theory). Experiments were conducted in 1971, when one clock was flown east and the other west. The times recorded by these clocks were compared to the ones at the US Naval Observatory. As per calculations, a clock travelling east should have gained 144±14 nanoseconds and lost 184±14 ns because of time dilation. Expected loss of time is 40±23 ns. The measurements gave a value of 59±10 ns. A clock travelling west was to gain 179±18 ns with a time dilation of 96±10 ns giving a shift of 275±21 ns. The measurements gave 273±7 ns. </P>
          <P>A measurement made with a rocket in 1976 at an altitude of 10,000 kms has given a blue shift accurate to 2 in 104. </P>
          <P>Thus, time runs faster at an altitude. So, if ever you are disgusted with this world, you should spend more time upstairs! But do not forget you may die quicker!</P>
          <P>Light bends in gravity </P>
          <P>The fact that a beam of lights bends in gravity, is an essential part of the General Theory of Relativity and is the one that helped validate it. The question that arises now is, what happens to a beam of light in an accelerating field? </P>
          <P>Let us go back to the spacecraft example. Let us fire a beam of light from one side of the craft to the other. Note that as before, this beam is at right angles to the motion of the craft. Let the space craft be away from the effect of gravity. If it is accelerated by a rocket, to an outside observer, the light beam merely takes a horizontal path and hits the other side as shown in (a). For an astronaut inside, there is a difference. By the time the light beam reaches the opposite wall the craft has moved up. Light strikes at a position below the target and seems to be bent downwards as shown in (b). The space craft is stationary, on the ground under the effect of gravity in condition (c). The light beam appears to be bent as observed in (b).</P>
          <P>Einstein made this prediction in 1915. It appeared that light from distant stars should bend when they come near a gravitational field, the sun, for instance. Scientists discovered a deflection, albeit very small, of 1.75 seconds of arc. </P>
          <P>Observing distant stars on regular days proves difficult due to the acute brightness of the sun. During a total solar eclipse sighting and observing stars becomes possible with the moon covering the sun. Sir Arthur Eddington, the British scientist, did exactly this in 1919 and proved Einstein right. In recent times, experiments have been performed at higher altitudes where the brightness of the sun ceases to be a problem. Einstein’s prediction has been verified to an accuracy of 0.7%. </P>
          <P>Newton’s theory had also predicted such a bending. It is based on his particle theory of light. Light particles bend because of gravity. But the amount of bending near the sun according to his theory was only half of what Einstein predicted.</P>
          <P>Gravitational Lensing</P>
          <P>Many interesting phenomena occur due to the bending of light in a gravitational field. Galaxies or clusters of galaxies can contribute to bending light from a distant source. In 1979, scientists observed what seemed to be two identical quasars close to each other. But one of them was actually a virtual image of the quasar, the handiwork of bending light. Repeated bending can result in strange patterns known as Gravitational Lensing. The magnification it can yield has helped astronomers discover a planet around a distant star in 2004. </P>
          <P>Curved Space – Time </P>
          <P>Isaac Newton had proposed his theory of gravitation more than two hundred years before. He held a mechanical view of the universe. According to him, gravitational force existed between earth and other objects, between planets etc. It could act over short or long distances. </P>
          <P>In reality, there is no mechanical connection between them. The force of attraction or gravity simply existed between any two objects. Nothing was transmitted between them. </P>
          <P>When Einstein started working, Maxwell’s Electromagnetic Theory had already been established. According to this theory, a field exists between objects. This field gives rise to a force, i.e., gravitational force and this force is transmitted between two objects. But we know that nothing can travel faster than light. Consequently, even this gravitational force should have a finite speed. Therefore, there cannot be instantaneous transmission of force between two objects. </P>
          <P>This was the dilemma that Einstein faced. How was he to relate gravity and electromagnetic theory? </P>
          <P>We have seen that the feather and the hammer are treated equally by gravity. This is also true of an astronaut who goes out of a spaceship and floats alongside it. The two traverse the same trajectory. Einstein asked himself another question. Gravity pulls a light object and a heavy object in the same manner i.e., with the same acceleration. How does it manage to do it? What is the secret?</P>
          <P>Einstein was at his best again and with a masterstroke amazed the world. He dismissed the notion that a body in a gravitational field can remain stationary or travel along a straight line. “Instead” he said, “in a gravitational field space itself becomes curved or distorted. Any object that finds itself there automatically follows the natural path which is the one we actually observe it to be.” The implication is that the feather and hammer have to follow that path; there is no option. The spaceship and the astronaut are merely following a laid out track! </P>
          <P>Out went the notion of the existence of a gravitational force that acted between two objects. Instead, what exists is a curved space which directs the motion of objects. Shortly, we will see that it is not just space, but it is actually a space time curvature. For the time being, let us understand curved space and extend the concept later. </P>
          <P>How do we understand this curved space? It is easy. Compare space to an elastic mattress . When a heavy object is placed on it, the mattress gets distorted. This is curved space. Einstein suggested that the curvature of space determines the path of motion for any object that falls within its range.</P>
          <P>So our galaxy is like a huge mattress with the sun, the earth and other planets placed on it. The mattress gets distorted by each of these. The curvature around the planet determines the gravity around it. Obviously, bigger the star or planet, more the curvature around it. </P>
          <P>Besides, we should consider time as well. We have seen that gravity causes phenomenon such as redshift, blueshift etc. So, three dimensions describe space; call them x, y and z. In addition we have time t. The spatial coordinates and time are interdependent. This is to say that we live in a four dimensional continuum called the Space Time Continuum. This may also be called Curved Spacetime. </P>
          <P>The paths that objects take in this four dimensional continuum are called geodesics. It is the path taken by an object during free fall. What was a straight line in an inertial frame (Special Theory) now becomes a geodesic. For example, the path taken by light from a distant star that bends as it nears the sun. </P>
          <P>In the words of Russell Stannard, “The crux of general Relativity is that matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move. Space is no longer to be regarded as a passive stage on which the actors – material objects and light – perform the drama. Space itself becomes a performer.” </P>
          <P>The Equations</P>
          <P>It is almost impossible to picture the four dimensional space time continuum. We can only grasp a three dimensional space. But such a limitation does not exist in mathematics. There are equations which can account for not just four, but any number of dimensions. This is what Einstein succeeded in; he conceived an equation that accounts for the relativistic effects. Of course, these are far more complicated than Newton’s conceptions and theories. </P>
          <P>The equations also needed special tools. Einstein used the Tensor Calculus developed by Ricci in 1887. He was also helped by Grossmann. The equation is given below.</P>
          <P>R<SPAN><Sub>μϑ</Sub></SPAN>–½g<SPAN><Sub>μϑ</Sub></SPAN>R=8T<SPAN><Sub>μϑ</Sub></SPAN></P>
          <P>In the above equation, R<SPAN><Sub>mn</Sub></SPAN> is called the Ricci Tensor and is a part of the curvature of space time that determines the degree to which matter converges or diverges in time. g<SPAN><Sub>mn</Sub></SPAN> is the important Metric Tensor and captures the geometric and causal structure of space time. R is the Ricci Scalar. T<SPAN><Sub>mn</Sub></SPAN> is the stress energy tensor. Simply stated, the equation helps calculate how an object distorts the space time around it and its subsequent effect on motion. </P>
          <P>Precession of Mercury and other Issues</P>
          <P>Scientists had made a curious observation about the planet Mercury. It is the closest to the sun and the sun’s gravity acts strongly on it. Mercury’s orbit is elliptical with the sun as one of the foci. The point of interest is the perihelion. The perihelion is the point on the elliptical orbit closest to the sun. According to Newton’s theory, Mercury traced the same orbit each time and the perihelion remained at the same position, represented as p in the diagram (a). But it was observed that the perihelion moved during every successive revolution of Mercury around the sun shown, as p1, p2 and p3 in the diagram (b). This is called the Precession of the perihelion of Mercury, at 43 seconds of arc in a century, really very negligible. While Newton’s theory could not predict it, Einstein’s theory readily did so. </P>
          <P>In 1974, Taylor and Hulse discovered a pulsar named PSR 1913+16. As predicted by the Theory of Relativity, the pulsar’s perihelion was moving at 4.2 degrees per year. </P>
          <P>Another verification of the General Theory was attempted by sending radar pulses to distant planets and allowing them to be bounced back to earth. The procedure was repeated when the planet was behind the sun. The theory predicts that there is a delay as the pulse passes near the sun. Experiments have been repeated for Mercury and Venus employing artificial satellites. The most accurate measurement was made in 2003, which proved that the theory was right to within 1 in 10-5. </P>
          <P>Einstein vs Newton </P>
          <P>Our discussion naturally leads to the question – Should we then abandon all that Newton said? The answer is, certainly not. Even today, in most circumstances we use Newton’s theories. In fact, for all situations in which the speeds are what we encounter in everyday life, Newton’s theories are quite adequate and accurate. Engineering design work, calculations in Fluid Mechanics are carried out using the Newtonian Theory. Aeroplanes fly following his laws. </P>
          <P>At high speeds close to that of light we have to include the relativistic effects. One such we have seen is the bending of light near a powerful gravitational field. The value obtained by Newton was only half the actual deflection. Relativity is relevant in the subatomic world dominated by particles that travel at speeds close to that of light. </P>
          <P>Black Holes</P>
          <P>Black holes are a curiosity; they feature in stories and movies; youngsters, science fiction enthusiasts are thrilled by them. What are they? What has Relativity to do with them? </P>
          <P>A star is fuelled by nuclear fusion that is generated within it. There is equilibrium between the enormous power of fusion on the one hand and gravity on the other. The strength of gravity depends upon the size of the star. However, this equilibrium cannot exist forever. The star will eventually run out of fuel. Then gravity takes the upper hand. Upon its death, a star becomes a black hole.</P>
          <P>After burning steadily for about 10, 000 million years, a star, the size of our sun, becomes a Red Giant. The star then sheds its outer layers and becomes a White Dwarf. A star which has a mass of 8 suns dies with a supernova explosion, and gravity takes the upper hand. The core becomes so small that the electrons circling the atoms are pushed into the nucleus. Thus they combine with protons and neutrons in the nucleus to produce more neutrons and neutrinos. These neutrinos are responsible for blasting out materials on explosion. The nucleus is now left only with neutrons, giving the star the name Neutron Star. Typically, a neutron star may have a mass that is 1.4 times that of the sun, with a size of may be 20 kms in diameter while the gravity may be 2x1011 times that on the earth. If the earth were to attain this condition its radius would be 1 cm while for our sun it would be 3 kms. </P>
          <P>Just imagine the consequences; the gravity is so strong that it is impossible for any object to overcome it. In fact, the volume of the star collapses until it becomes zero! But the mass remains the same. So, in effect density becomes infinite. This denotes the birth of a Black Hole. Oppenheimer and Snyder, in 1939 had predicted this based on the Theory of Relativity. The name Black Hole was given later in 1967 by Robert Wheeler. </P>
          <P>The possible distortion of space (really space time) close to a black hole is indicated in the figure. The curve almost reduces to a point as we go down. This is a singularity. Further, when the spatial dimensions become so small we enter the regime of atoms and particles where quantum mechanics comes into play. Schwarzschild has contributed substantially to the understanding of black holes. </P>
          <P>No object can come out of a black hole; not even light. A black hole absorbs any light that falls in it and does not reflect anything. So it appears black, hence the name. It has been compared to mighty waterfalls. If one is carried away by one such, there is no point of return as happens in a black hole. </P>
          <P>There are different types of black holes. The Stellar Black Hole is formed when a star collapses. The Galactic Black Hole is formed when a galaxy collapses. There is a black hole at the centre of every galaxy. Our own Milky Way galaxy has one with a mass of 3 million solar masses. Mini Black Holes do not have enough gravity to compress them, but they can be compressed by an external pressure. </P>

          <P>Srinivasa Ramanujan </P>
          <P>By Sydney Srinivas, (with an introduction to the Mathematics of Ramanujan by Michael D Hirschhorn), published by Prism Books Private Limited, 2012.</P>
          <P>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a world-class mathematician from India. Born in 1887, in the state of Tamilnadu, India, Ramanujan proved to be a prodigy when still in high school. His extra-ordinary mathematical powers came to light during his college days. His undivided attention to mathematical study took its toll; he failed his exams and had to give up formal studies. But he continued to tackle complex mathematical problems in the humble environs of his home. Endowed with extraordinary mathematical insight, he was able to propose, without proof, more than 3000 theorems; highly qualified mathematicians are still trying to prove them.</P>
          <P>Encouraged by his mentors, Ramanujan sent some of his findings to Prof. Hardy of Cambridge University, who at once invited him to be his colleague. They worked together for five years and contributed significantly to Partitions, Continued Fractions and other branches of mathematics. Ramanujan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Trinity College. However, he was forced to return to India due to ill health;he died when he was only 32.</P>
          <P>In this book, Sydney Srinivas gives an impressive and lucid account of Ramanujan’s life. Apart from many visuals and photographs, it contains numerous anecdotes from a life that oscillated between agony and ecstasy. The author traces Ramanujan’s life as a child, through his student life and as clerk at the Madras port and his struggles in England. The great influence of his mother Komalathammal in his life is clearly evoked. </P>
          <P>A special feature of the book is the short introduction by Dr Hrischhorn, an eminent Ramanujan scholar, to Taxicab Number, Partition Numbers and Continued Fraction, some of the complex mathematical problems that Ramanujan tackled.</P>
