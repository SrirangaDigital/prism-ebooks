> Gundappa, popularly known as DVG was more a phenomenon than an individual. There is a saying in English – “Some write books on history, but some others create history”. DVG belonged to the latter category.  Born in a Tamil family on 17th March, 1887 in a predominantly Telugu region - Mulabagal in Kolar District of Karnataka – he was a very great scholar in Sanskrit and English.  There is a saying in Kannada that there is no leaf which the goat does not touch. There is no subject on which DVG has not written. It is said about Oliver Goldsmith that there was nothing he touched which he did not adorn. DVG’s works are innumerable to be even mentioned in a short note like this.</SPAN

His works on religion are a special category by themselves – Purusha Sukta (1953, 1971), Isopanishat (1953, 1970) Bhagavadgita Tatparya (1966, 1971), God (1973) and Rita, Satya, Dharma (1975).

Many scholars think that his Manku Thimmana Kagga which has seen many editions (1943, 1950, 1958, 1964, 1969, 1987 et al) is his magnum opus. However, it is his most popular work and there are many who can recite it from the beginning to the end as they do the Bhagavadgita.  There are as many as twenty scholarly works of comment and criticism on it. The English translations of Mankuthimmana Kagga by Sri. D. Seshagiri Rao and Sri. A. Narasimha Bhat who have also translated DVG’s Marula Muniyana Kagga and the six Audio Cassettes by Swami Brahmananda must be specially mentioned. The best Kannada critics have written books and articles on DVG Among them, Professor L.S. Seshagiri Rao, C.N. Mangala, </SPAN

>Devanahalli Venkataramanaiyya Gundappa, popularly known as DVG is often compared to an ashwattha tree (Ficus Religiosa) in the forest of Kannada renaissance which is both literary and cultural. In him we find many wonderful personalities that include a great scholar, ace journalist, profound socio-political thinker, cultural Messiah, literary master and a great humanist. He is simultaneously good and wise, self-less and humble, friendly and disciplined, traditional and modern, hearty and brainy and many more. He is one among those rare great sons of India too who played a remarkable role in its struggle for political and cultural freedom in an inimitably self-less manner. To sum up in one word, DVG is a modern Rsi of India in general and of Karnataka in particular. </SPAN

>Such a masterly writing is rendered in to English by my good friend Sri S M Haricharan. Hence he definitely deserves the wholehearted compliments of all those who are interested in enriching their lives. It is a long felt need of many and that has been aptly fulfilled by him. The sad part of the modern Indian youth is the absolutely zero knowledge of the masterly writings of the savants in the regional languages. Due to this ignorance, they are often going to the cheap and corrupt western versions of our classical wisdom. Least to say that it is highly deplorable and when such is </SPAN

>the situation, it is very heartening that qualified and sensible youngsters like Mr. Haricharan are coming forward to take this task of mirroring the masters of Indian languages in to readable English and help the less-privileged. Sri Haricharan, apart from being a technocrat, a serious student of Indian culture and literature. His interests in music and philosophy too are commendable. His present task of taking DVG through his little classic Baaligondu Nambike to the larger world of English-readers is rewarding in many ways and I take this opportunity to congratulate him for this labor of love. May such efforts of him and the like increase and perpetuate not only the memory of DVG, but also of many masters like him. </SPAN

The original book written in is collection of essays and articles written by Dr. D.V.G and published in the then leading dailies in the near post independence period of 1950. The questions that are raised are highly thought provoking and just provide a glimpse of what a great visionary and social thinker he was. It is hard to believe that some of them even now are relevant and haunt us as responsible citizens of this country. It tries to shake us from our comfort zone that we all have established as self-centered individuals and take the ownership of contributing to larger part of society and thereby putting the entire nation on a progressive path. </SPAN

He was a person who had learnt music &amp; literature and had realized his supreme God through this. He could attain happiness by singing prayers. Can we be in the same state or get to that? As he had complete faith in Lord Keshava (Krishna) do we have faith in any other subject? Like his goal was happiness through devotion, what is our goal? Goal is one of the forms of goodness. </SPAN

As we observe that the distribution of the various organs in the human body is in the same proportions with respect to different individuals there are subtle differences which makes us to distinctly identify. Even when the individual is not directly in front of us we are able to recognize by his voice or may also be from few mannerisms which every individual would have built. The differences are not essentially on the physical aspects but also on the other features or attributes the individual possesses such as responses of the sensual organs coupled with characteristic differences such as one being more arrogant, friendly, and compassionate or likes and dislike. At the macro level there are differences in the individual on the socio-economic aspect varying from someone being poor to extremely rich. </SPAN

Some kinds of foods have the ability to provide strength but they need to be consumed in limit. If we consume more we get intoxicated and so is the case with wealth.

Moksha belongs to a different class all together and gets a distinct treatment. It is specially attached to saints, individuals detached from society and spiritual leaders. Dharma, Artha and Kama create a connection and bonding to the society we all live in. This connection over a period of time makes us go through turmoil of experiences. This is the difficulty of bonding and getting released from such kind of bonding which passes through ages is salvation. For humans the thought of the supreme soul and consistent meditation on it, provides a protective shield against the sufferings he undergoes. An individual who recognizes and comprehends that supreme energy which is omnipresent has the ability to understand the value of the materialistic world and stay detached from such kind of superficial existence.

Our life is a daily fight and we need to have practiced various techniques to emerge victorious. One leg is inadequate to walk and one hand is not enough for our work. Just like that one, philosophy alone doesn't suffice to stay productive in this life. This does not anyway suggest that there is something greater that will be revealed here. The attempt that is being made here is also not something that is outstanding, not a difficult one and nor challenging. To make our life self satisfactory and meaningful one we do not require some special books, we need few simple formulae which can be comprehended by us and strongly hold on to those by practicing them. The best example to such a life is that of Mahatma Gandhi. He was not a great scholar nor did he research on great works, all that he did was to have belief in few principles and live by it with higher dedication to make it fruitful. Whatever may be our philosophy or fundamental principles the key to success lies in strong belief and following it with higher commitment?

Every establisher of religion may have found the necessity for a new religion by observing the social conditions present then. The greatest motivation for him was from the dissatisfaction seen in the society.

>The other reason could have been prolonged indulgence in the enjoyment of victory and luxury leading to lack of practice of positive energy giving way to hardships and difficulties and eventually creating a changed mindset. Let us all recollect a common experience of the world. A person who was born poor attains wealth and fame in society because of his intellectual capabilities and physical effort. When he dies he leaves the family in the wealth and comfort created by him. If we assume that his children also engage in further growth of wealth, in the following generations of his grandchildren or great-grandchildren they start neglecting the primary attributes for creation of this wealth and also fail to put their individual effort. Further, all these result in enjoyment of created wealth, animosity among the family members, unhappiness finally getting engulfed in poverty and decline. As is the famous quote “Seeds of failure are embedded in the greatest moments of success” so will be the attitude of people who have been gifted with success and wealth rather than they would have deservingly earned. It could be therefore suggested that our ancestors who had toiled hard to create a mind of strength and courage was uprooted by the later generations and developed a mindset of defeat. </SPAN

Therefore lead your life for the world; experience and tolerate victory and loss with equal measure. Analyze the situation and act. Work and be victorious as a disciple of Lord Shiva.” </SPAN

>ife is a huge subject. It is most sacred and deserves all         respect.  For a life to germinate and take its birth the creator would have made many preparations prior to it. We need to constantly rethink about it. In plants, in lizards, snakes, reptiles, fishes and other animals there are strange mechanisms devised by nature to enable reproduction. Human body is an astonishing machine. It is filled with chemical elements which drive it, chemicals such as human mind. It is created with various such mechanisms, hard labor of patience and love by God.  To call that inferior and ignoring is not a wisely act. To respect this life and lead it to a good position with all possible efforts is a dharmishta (follower of dharma). Every life is a hidden treasure of innumerable energies. A life, whose such hidden or inherent energy gets enriched, strengthened and becomes available for welfare of mankind will become successfully complete. Therefore it is inappropriate to be unenthusiastic with respect to life. There has to be devotion and interest with respect to all matters of life. </SPAN

>ongs of philosophy, hymns about various gods, verses written by servants of god all preach detachment which is inappropriate and easily attainable. Such a detachment is restricted to words and of complete inaction. It only helps to build laziness, cowardly seclusion and detachment born out of inability. “Nothing is possible from me; everything is controlled and managed by someone else. What is the use of you struggling? Do not strain yourselves unnecessarily; just sit and keep meditating on God” is the common thing preached by divine songs of god. Added to this are the songs of dejection which proclaim “what is the point in comforting this human body equivalent to log of wood?” In the very first instance people are facing hardships and are subjected to poverty and on top of it if this so called divine songs preach “do not worry about what’s happening, you be where you are as what can you accomplish you are just a human being” they get easily influenced to them leaving behind their responsibilities and duties.

>oes it mean that we do not require devotion to God? It is a redundant question. No one is saying that we do not require devotion to God. But, the question here is in understanding the right kind of devotion. Devotion means display of holy ash, vermilion, necklace of holy beads, traditional trident, sacred pendants is the thinking of many people. Endless chanting of Rama, Shiva (Hindu Gods) and singing holy songs at temples are the main characteristics of devotion is the opinion of few. These practices and principles are bad and are futile is not anyone’s contention. But our stance is these are not sufficient. Let there be singing of divine songs and wearing of holy objects as this might provide some kind of solace and strength to few human minds. Just as we decorate our houses with colorful paints, flowers and leaves during festival and auspicious occasions, holy chanting and ornamentation can bring some radiance to life. But decoration alone does not make it a festival there needs to be some good food prepared in the house for the occasion. This means devotion needs to have more of wisdom driven efforts along with holy chanting. Devotion does not mean mental turbulence alone but also include human efforts. Devotion means an emotion which originates from heart and emerges out of our throat is an old feeling. Devotion is energy of soul that originates in our head and gets out through our hands is our opinion. The seat of devotion is heart is a thinking of past, </SPAN

These are usually the coins and banknotes of a particular government, which comprise the physical aspects of a nation’s money supply. The other part of a nation’s money supply consists of bank deposits (sometimes called deposit money), ownership of which can be transferred by means of cheques, debit cards, or other forms of money transfer. Deposit money and currency are money in the sense that both are acceptable as a means of payment. Money in the form of currency has predominated in human civilizations from about 10,000 BCE. In most cases, each private central bank has monopoly control over the supply and production of its own currency. To facilitate trade between these currency zones, there are different exchange rates, which are the prices at which currencies (and the goods and services of individual currency zones) can be exchanged against each other. Currencies can be classified as either floating currencies or fixed currencies based on their exchange rate regime. </SPAN

>here is an important thing that needs to be said to people residing in villages. People speaking at political rallies and news journalists have a practice to describe rural citizens as highly innocent. They are uneducated, therefore are innocent, free of deceit and are honest are the general praise showered on them. This is a matter of exaggeration. People who graze cattle are not embedded with kindness and innocence of them. There was a time when our ancestors did their transactions keeping Sun and Moon as the witness, taking oath keeping one’s hand on the other and were retracting to swear untruth in front of idols in temple. That era is far behind us now. There are ample people who are aware of law and few lawyers in every nook and corner of the country. Lawyers are dime and dozen who offer advice at convenience and therefore people in villages take the superficial knowledge of law as sufficient for them. Over and above the ethical conduct has two dangers I) they are economically backward and there is a natural urge to somehow make money as there is saying </SPAN

Sumptuous food, clothing enough to cover body, treasury filled with grains, barn filled with cattle was the sole purpose of our ancestors and today’s villagers believe money is strength and their purpose is to have cash in hand and cash in bank. They have learnt this from urbanites. Person who first created money a mesmerizing tool also needs to be credited with creation of all evil things of the civilization. The atrocities and clashes that have taken place because of this person has not been caused by no other individual. In agrarian based economy such kind of destruction is not possible as grains cannot be hoarded for a longtime as it will get rotten and no one can hoard large quantities escaping notice of others. One has to utilize the food grains in one form or the other. But, when currency rules the economy, one has the ability to reserve the wealth in whatever form and wherever possible in most secretive manner. Materialistic comforts and luxury which cannot be purchased through grains can be easily obtained by money. This creates a greed for money and desire to acquire wealth by whatever means. Government officers, Lawyers, Professors, Businessman and every other class of people have all chosen this path. So, how long can our friends living in villages be free of such thoughts and action? </SPAN

People living in villages employ other methods which are little crude and noticeable. Deceit groups, rivalry, disputes, corruption, pomp and show are present in wealthy societies but well disguised in the aristocratic fashion. But in rural areas they come across as presented badly. The root of all human beings is one and therefore sanctification as to happen not only in rural parts of country but also to elite class of the urban society. Truth, Honesty, fear of conscience and righteousness are fundamental for development. Until we toil hard and grow these fundamentals it is unlikely for us to see progress in our society, Europe serves as evidence to fact wealth created on immoral grounds deceives peace of mind. </SPAN

>We have explored and found various reasons and causes for India to come under foreign rule. Another important reason for this is our narrow mindedness. We lack the practice of thinking about welfare of society; it appears that we undertake any social responsibility tasks (such as building shelter for underprivileged, hospitals, planting trees) more in anticipation of obtaining safe place in heaven or obtain a clean image in society rather than born out of self drive to do something better for the ecosystem we live in. People who do not get adequate respect and status in this world do not get mind to attempt to do anything for others. Our ancestors discarded the thinking about this world as something mean. Naturally thoughts about our city or village, state, nation all vanished from our minds. “Thinking about the city, wealthy person became poor” with this opinion our people lost the national pride. This led to downfall of our society. We left the concern about the village to the village head; state to the rulers or government of state. To the extent the Village head or rulers of state were efficient citizens obtained well being. If the governors of villages and state were useless and inappropriate the citizen’s welfare worsened. Our ancestors did not define rules and principles for governors of state to appropriately deliver their responsibilities. They believed more on the ruler’s self commitment to righteousness. They did not see any reason for not keeping faith in their governors. But in our era there is higher and urgent need to have a good governing system to monitor the functioning of our Heads of State or Nation. Democracy has been a great tool and weapon which we are gifted to voice our opinion and elect an able and efficient leadership but it is our important duty to exercise this collectively with right intellect. </SPAN

 have mentioned before that empire of science is not without limitations. Science can capture all those which can come to experience of our senses. Metaphysical objects and their actions can be explained to an extent by Physics and Biology. The supreme energy that is behind Physics is completely unexplainable by science. For this reason we need to bear in our mind that there certain things which is beyond the boundary of science. This is because looking at the scientific inventions and discoveries, Scientists can over stretch themselves to believe that nothing is farfetched for it. Last few years the advancement of Science and Technology has been profound, the nuclear advancements, travel to moon and exploration of other planetary objects, information technology explosion and so on. This is going to continue further but one basic tenet has to be remembered that science is part of world nature and is not beyond nature, it is in fact child of it. We have been able to create all these miracles from the raw material and principles made available by nature; clay is the same the pot that is being molded is new; hands of the potter is still the same the wheel that is available to make pots is different. Science has not created any new sense or any new organ. Even if succeed to develop something new the basis of that still will be of the same clay. What comes to light from this is that Science is an effort to bring out all the hidden capabilities of ancient nature; but will not create new nature itself. </SPAN

Even Vishwamithra attempted to create a clone of four faced Brahma which is an act of copying but not originality. As the limitations of Science are of this nature, it is not wise to lose our intellect to newer scientific thoughts and discard the everlasting spiritual knowledge. There is no conflict between Science and Spirituality. There is no need for a Spiritual practitioner to accuse Science. Life looks complete and gets beautified when one blends Science and Spirituality; Science at level of transactions and Spirituality at level of thinking. </SPAN

Those which are not accessible to eyes are accessible to nose, that which appears false to nose is confirmed as truth by ears; things which are said to be unseen by ears are seen by eyes. Something that is not identified by one sensory organ can easily identified by other. The field of influence of any sense organ is limited. Eye power of every individual is different if one has the capability to spot something that is there few inches away and some can spot few feet away. But no human eye can spot that is miles away. Same is the case with one’s ears. If one kind of music can bring out happiness and pleasure for certain group of people, the same can be boring and not so pleasant to others but no one can hear the naturally s produced sound few miles away. Therefore what can be true for sense organ can be totally false for other. All of us have different tastes and preferences, if one likes sweet; it might be completely distasteful to others. As we observe that the capabilities of every sense organ is distinct and limited; one cannot refute the claim that there could be things which are beyond the capabilities of these sense organs.

Light emerging out of Wisdom and emotions of heart together give rise to a new light. Wisdom can be obtained through studies of various subjects but light that as to emerge out of heart has to come through interactions with society and not through self study. One should practice sympathy for difficulties of world. He has to participate in sharing the burden of the society. In process of working towards it he has to decrease his narrow mindedness and expand boundary of his soul.

In this process he will mingle well with the society, comprehend various individual mannerisms, mould his behavior to the society, constantly rectify oneself and expanding his mind on his own will allow his soul to grow. Social service is the daily duty related to national welfare and is the best school for education to allow growth of heart.

With the new age politics the village strength is being broken, in lure of the salaries and other comforts people from villages are moving to workplaces in factories or offices. In context of election, for sake of competing more crime is becoming rampant. There is scant attention towards the agricultural land. We are importing several essential food commodities from other countries. Is it required to fill politics to such an extent? Is it good for the people? Is it difficult to control the commotion during the election? All these are the prime questions. If we assume that there is certain amount of politics required, we need mechanisms to counter the ill effects of it. Agricultural practice is a profession which teaches people unity. Without friendship and co-operation it is hard to cultivate the land even for a day. Tilling, ploughing, cultivating, harvesting, cleaning, chafing, transporting all of them require man power. Cultivation is not a single person activity. It requires various farm equipment and other paraphernalia which needs to be available at right time. Even the cattle that are required at times required. In this way cultivation is a co-operative effort of many houses and that is the beauty of it. Therefore it develops humanity. High amount of automation and technology erodes this human bonding.

People who are pensioners or who have taken voluntary retirement from services and who still have the capability to work need to take this up as their responsibility. Even in them, people who have lands that can be cultivated need to make up their minds to stay in villages and through their good conduct will have to transform the minds of the village citizens. One large co-operative movement, one festival and one social center can erode the philistine thinking of several individuals and lift their minds to a higher altitude.(In this regard it is very appropriate to remind ourselves of the Operation Flood started by Mr. Kurien which transformed life of several milk farmers). Every village or town has a place of worship. This can easily be made as center of activity to organize discourses, discussions on scriptures, village festivals and elate the beauty of them. This can easily kill the boredom of villages. The rampant transformation we have seen in the infrastructure related to transportation and communication further enables to provide any facility and entertainment that is available in urban cities to villages. This has to be enabled by the educated class first with the help of the government taking it up as a joint responsibility. The essential service that needs to be rendered to the nation today is the upliftment of villages. Upliftment here refers to number of people residing in villages, their health, physical strength, clean and tidy environment of their households, growth of their livestock, rejuvenation and development of lakes and ponds, primary education, medical facilities and above all this to control the migration of population from villages to urban cities. People who are physically and intellectually strong should stay in their respective villages and put their strength to use for the development. In order to enable this we need to adequately fill motivational factors in villages. A good society is the only medicine to bad politics. Welfare and Development of villages has to become a primary goal in Social service. </SPAN

A citizen in the West fully acknowledges the privileges and support rendered to him by government and is cognizant that he has to receive more and in-return he has certain duties that he needs to perform is something that always stays in his memory. In our case the fact that we need to bear in mind that we are indebted to nation is itself something that is not well received by us. Our righteousness and duty does not cross the boundary of our house. We need to earn well; need to leave property for our wife and children and need to be comfortable in our houses is our thought process. Our visit to temples and holy places is also to ensure that we bring welfare and wealth to our family. The thought of nation very rarely occurs to our mind. This is narrow minded thinking of our righteousness. Duty and responsibility towards family is big and of foremost importance.

People here are increasingly getting attracted to such materialistic comforts but if we just study our ancient culture and practices we can clearly understand that our path is distinct than that of the westerners. In our society the foundation of the social order and practices is on the human value system. Soul is greater than physical body. Achieving solace of the soul is higher than the physical pleasures.

Western marriages are primarily concerned with two individuals who are tying the knot. Indian marriages are generally related to welfare of the two families they represent. Ours is a socialistic society where as the Westerners is a capitalist society laying emphasis more on individual comforts rather than family values. Thus, in the primary vision of architecting the social structure itself we are different and therefore it does reflect similar feelings in other societal practices. Industrial revolution was the root cause for growth of their society; agriculture formed the basis for growth of our society. As the Western countries lost their mind to accumulation of wealth through trade neglecting agriculture their situation became like hen which found gems while searching for food grains. Most of the countries have lost the capacity to grow food grains and heavily import them. We have to look at ways and means of industrializing the nation without losing our focus on agriculture.

If they are not able to achieve that goal then their immediate reaction is: revolt; revolt is often unkindly, mob behavior and violent. To disrupt the existing order or system even before thinking of constructing new one is not the right thing to do. We start holding rich responsible for all the poverty and clean homes for all the untidy ones. These things are easier to do and make them like culprits for our situations. People who became rich were at some point poor and people fail to examine the reasons and their actions that made them wealthy. No one has the patience to perform root cause analysis of their situations and identify the underlying factors which shape up their lives. This also does not mean that everyone who is wealthy has accumulated it in the most just manner but it advocates examining the governing and political boundary of accumulating wealth. Any change in system should not be a knee jerk reaction due to frustration. </SPAN

There is no good thing in our lives which can be achieved in one single day and which can be enjoyed throughout our lives.

With whatever wisdom and caution we try to conduct ourselves in executing our duties there is bound to be some short coming in the end result. This is the principle of progress.

As is our duty to surmount the challenges with enthusiastic effort so is our duty to patiently and bravely endure it. Patience and Human effort are not two different situations but they need to blend into one. Patience does not mean inaction and effort does not mean fight with fit of rage. Patience is to have balanced and calm mind without tumultuous emotions of anger; constantly disallowing the mind to be lethargic and inactive with thoughts of progress and engaging outwardly in rightful action is effort. In this way human effort is a kind of education of soul. </SPAN

A branch which appears worn and weeding out now is sprouting with new leaves in the very next week. Our human life is also similar with progressive intellect, wisdom, development, enthusiasm on one side and on other side we have wagered mind, effort in vain and complete lack of enthusiasm. There is no space anywhere for complete greed or despair. Rising, falling, rolling, spreading somehow the river of life goes on at all times. Why should we fear and loose heart? For sake of education and enrichment of soul we need to aim and achieve progress. In that we should not have greed, ill temper, and unnecessary excitement for fruits of our efforts and at the same time it is not good to have laziness, lack of human effort. Our activity should continue uninterrupted like act of nature, celestial activities and sprouts of plants. </SPAN
