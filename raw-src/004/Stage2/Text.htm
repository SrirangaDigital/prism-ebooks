<P><strong>DVG </strong></P>
<P>D.V. Gundappa, popularly known as DVG was more a phenomenon than an individual. There is a saying in English – “Some write books on history, but some others create history”. DVG belonged to the latter category. Born in a Tamil family on 17th March, 1887 in a predominantly Telugu region - Mulabagal in Kolar District of Karnataka – he was a very great scholar in Sanskrit and English. There is a saying in Kannada that there is no leaf which the goat does not touch. There is no subject on which DVG has not written. It is said about Oliver Goldsmith that there was nothing he touched which he did not adorn. DVG’s works are innumerable to be even mentioned in a short note like this.</P>
<P>. </P>
<P>.</P>
<P><SPAN>However, just a few must be mentioned to understand the stature of this intellectual giant. He has written five biographies, among them two on Vidyaranya (1983), eight Memoirs, among them one on Artists (1970), one on Literature creators (1970), one on the Dewans of Mysore (1971) and one on Vaidic traditionalists (1972), two works on Children’s literature, four works on nonfiction prose. His interest in Drama and Theatre resulted in the writing seven plays, among them the translation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth (1936, 1974). His works on religion are a special category by themselves – Purusha Sukta (1953, 1971), Isopanishat (1953, 1970) Bhagavadgita Tatparya (1966, 1971), God (1973) and Rita, Satya, Dharma (1975). He has to his credit fifteen collections of poems, among them Nivedana (1924, 1933, 1956), Vidyaranya </SPAN>Stuti (1924) Antahpura Gite (1950, 1953), Valmiki Vyasa Vandanam (1951), Gita Shakuntalam (1960, 1961) etc. However, two of his very special works are Manku Thimmana Kagga &amp; Marula Muniyana Kagga. Many scholars think that his Manku Thimmana Kagga which has seen many editions (1943, 1950, 1958, 1964, 1969, 1987 et al) is his magnum opus. However, it is his most popular work and there are many who can recite it from the beginning to the end as they do the Bhagavadgita. There are as many as twenty scholarly works of comment and criticism on it. The English translations of Mankuthimmana Kagga by Sri. D. Seshagiri Rao and Sri. A. Narasimha Bhat who have also translated DVG’s Marula Muniyana Kagga and the six Audio Cassettes by Swami Brahmananda must be specially mentioned. The best Kannada critics have written books and articles on DVG Among them, Professor L.S. Seshagiri Rao, C.N. Mangala, </P>
<P>T.N. Padmanabhan, G.S. Chakravarthi, P. Balakrishna Rao and </P>
<P>G.P. Rajarathnam. “A special mention must be made of Shatavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh who is an authority on DVG and he has made a special study of the metrical experiments in DVG’s poetry. It may not out of place to mention here that DVG was quite a “Personality”.“A very impressive figure, a wonderful and witty conversationalist, a dominating “presence” in any company, a lover of life with great zest and zeal, he gave assurance of a complete man.

<H2><strong>Foreword </strong></H2>
<P>Devanahalli Venkataramanaiyya Gundappa, popularly known as DVG is often compared to an ashwattha tree (Ficus Religiosa) in the forest of Kannada renaissance which is both literary and cultural. In him we find many wonderful personalities that include a great scholar, ace journalist, profound socio-political thinker, cultural Messiah, literary master and a great humanist. He is simultaneously good and wise, self-less and humble, friendly and disciplined, traditional and modern, hearty and brainy and many more. He is one among those rare great sons of India too who played a remarkable role in its struggle for political and cultural freedom in an inimitably self-less manner. To sum up in one word, DVG is a modern Rsi of India in general and of Karnataka in particular. </P>
<P>Apart from his manifold social, political, cultural and the like service-activities, DVG wrote extensively in Kannada and English. </P>
<P>Especially his writings in Kannada that include a large variety prose and verse, rich in both quality and quantity, comprising of poems, plays, songs, translation, children literature, biographies, pen-portraits, memoirs; technical writings in the field of political science and journalism, philosophy and religion, poetics and criticism are a class by themselves and have stood the test of time. Thus he has naturally become one of the pioneers of Kannada literature in shaping and empowering it as a complete language. </P>
<P>Even today some of his prose and verse writings are best sellers and torch bearers in the area of beautifying the lives of one and all. They are equally appealing to both head and heart and endear the learned and the lay alike. </P>
<P>Baaligondu Nambike (Faith for Life) is DVG’s one of the most popular and profound works. In this, basing on his own contemplation of life, he has made a wonderful and equally successful attempt towards synthesizing as practical philosophy of life which is lucidly understandable and adoptable to one and all. In fact the author himself has stated in his foreword that this work is an honest attempt towards the realization of his own life’s purpose and process, faith and function. </P>
<P>The complete writing is very simple to understand lively to read and lovely to contemplate upon. Though the wisdom contained in it is sublime and eternal, no where the author has made it pedantic and preaching. In this short booklet, DVG has practically given the distilled philosophy of the East and the West that has paramount use in the way of leading a simple and sublime life. Nothing in this sweet work is impractical and nonspiritual. Every word is loaded and every leaf is a journey of joy. What the author has attempted in his other three great and well known works namely the <em>Mankutimmana Kagga</em> a poem, <em>Jnaapakacitrashaale</em> a memoir and <em>Jeevanadharmayoga</em> a scholarly study on the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, is succinctly summed up here. </P>
<P>Such a masterly writing is rendered in to English by my good friend Sri S M Haricharan. Hence he definitely deserves the wholehearted compliments of all those who are interested in enriching their lives. It is a long felt need of many and that has been aptly fulfilled by him. The sad part of the modern Indian youth is the absolutely zero knowledge of the masterly writings of the savants in the regional languages. Due to this ignorance, they are often going to the cheap and corrupt western versions of our classical wisdom. Least to say that it is highly deplorable and when such is the situation, it is very heartening that qualified and sensible youngsters like Mr. Haricharan are coming forward to take this task of mirroring the masters of Indian languages in to readable English and help the less-privileged. Sri Haricharan, apart from being a technocrat, a serious student of Indian culture and literature. His interests in music and philosophy too are commendable. His present task of taking DVG through his little classic Baaligondu Nambike to the larger world of English-readers is rewarding in many ways and I take this opportunity to congratulate him for this labor of love. May such efforts of him and the like increase and perpetuate not only the memory of DVG, but also of many masters like him. </P>

<H2><strong>Preface </strong></H2>
<P>This book is a translation of one of the most prolific thinker, literary wizard of Karnataka Dr. D.V. Gundappa (fondly remembered as DVG). The original book written in is collection of essays and articles written by Dr. D.V.G and published in the then leading dailies in the near post independence period of 1950. The questions that are raised are highly thought provoking and just provide a glimpse of what a great visionary and social thinker he was. It is hard to believe that some of them even now are relevant and haunt us as responsible citizens of this country. It tries to shake us from our comfort zone that we all have established as self-centered individuals and take the ownership of contributing to larger part of society and thereby putting the entire nation on a progressive path. </P>
<P>Each time I have read the original work it has startled me as to how execution of some of the recommendations could have helped our nation in shunning the developing nation tag and put itself to strongly compete with the economic powers. The articulations used by the author to identify the differences existing between the western civilization and us and thereby suggest a path that is conducive yet result yielding is simply superb. </P>
<P>My humble attempt at translation of this great work is more of self gratifying experience to share with larger audience which has English as second language invariably. The spark to take up this project came when Dr. R. Ganesh mentioned as to what a huge benefit it could be if the original work were to be available in English. By stating this, I have no right to take the credit of bringing this for benefit to the society and nor is there a need to demonstrate the intellectual strength and the social contribution Dr. DVG rendered during his lifetime. It is quite magnanimous and he will be recollected for centuries to come through innumerable works, the gem of which being Mankuthimmana Kagga. </P>
<P>This journey of translation that I undertook has transformed me for better and helped me to set in right objectives for myself. It is this benefit that I would like to pass on to you when you read this work. I am joyous and thankful that you already have taken first step in this direction by picking up this book for reading. The book is not intended to any selective audience but to each one of us who have the innate desire to achieve and build something that is impactful for larger part of society and which is beyond our selfish desires and passions. You, as a reader may be of any sex, be in any profession or of any socio-economic background and any age, this reading will compel you to rethink and reorient for better personal and professional life. This is definitely not a self-help book or is aimed to drive home any philosophy. It will serve you to wake up to some hard facts that can be an eye opener for taking positive action. </P>
<P>First, I need to thank Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs and Shri S R Ramaswamy, Honorable Secretary of GIPA for benevolently allowing me to go ahead with the publication and printing of this translation work. </P>
<P>I am deeply indebted and thankful to Dr. R. Ganesh who has been my inspiring Guru and has taken pain to review and obliged with a Foreword for this book. It was his remark during one of our study circle discussions that kindled my thought to take up this task. </P>
<P>My friends in personal and professional life who have impacted my thought process directly or indirectly during this period of translation. </P>
<P>My special thanks to Mr. Pranesh Siravara, MD of Prism Books and his entire team for accepting to publish work of a novice like me. Their encouragement and support has helped me to humbly offer this book to all you readers. </P>
<P>Of course, it would definitely not have been possible without the encouragement and support of my immediate family – Anna, Amma, Chethan, Shilpa and Sarvajeeth. </P>

<P><em>“The highest truth is this: God is present in all beings. They are his multiple forms. There is no other God to seek… It is a man making religion that we want… Give up these wakening mysticisms and be strong… For the next fifty years… let all other Gods disappear from our minds. This is the only God that is awake, our own race, everywhere. His hands everywhere, his feet everywhere his ears; He covers everything….The first of all worships is the worship of these all around us…He alone serves God who serves all other beings.” </em></P>

<H2><strong>Life </strong></H2>
<P><em>How mean am I when Life gives me gold and I give you silver, and yet I deem myself generous. </em></P>

<H4>-<strong>Kahlil Gibran </strong></H4>
<P>hat is Life? Why Life? What do we live for? Do we live to die or is there any higher meaning to our Life? The great Saint Kanakadasa has said the following: </P>
<P>“Every work done by every individual in this world is to satisfy the three basic needs food, shelter and clothing. We often speak kind words to impress others and lie to each other to curry out materialistic gains. People assume various roles and behave pretentiously it is only for sake of above benefits.” </P>
<P>So should we conclude and sum it up that this is the mystery of life. </P>
<P>In our houses the livestock, pets, roaches and rodents all live for this purpose. All animals dwelling in the forest, birds in the sky and all other living beings live to satiate their stomach, strengthen their shelter and seek sweetness of love. No living being can escape the thoughts of food, sleep, companionship and overcoming fear of death which are common to all. What one needs to examine and introspect is whether the fate of human- being is being confined to such thoughts like other animals or is he higher to them in any aspect? Is there an objective or goal to humanbeing higher than striving for food, shelter and clothes? </P>
<P>If we look at people around us it doesn’t seem or appear that any such questions cross minds of at least fifty per cent of them. Most of them live like any other animal striving hard day in day out without a higher purpose in life. They finally rest in peace without having made any impact or impression to the external world of their existence. It is very apt to recollect what Isaac Asimov mentioned in Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology which is that one in 6 million who have walked on this earth have managed to leave footprints behind them and rest of have just passed like insects. </P>
<P>Is this the right thing to do? Is there any other noble thought or purpose of life that can be identified by us? </P>

<H2><strong>Larger Goal </strong></H2>
<P><em>Young men, life is before you. Two voices are calling you – one coming out from the swamps of selfishness and force, where success means death and the other from hilltops of justice and progress, where even failure brings glory. Two lights are seen in your horizon – one, the fast fading marsh light of power, and the other slowly rising sun of human brotherhood. Two ways lie open for you – one leading to an even lower and lower plain, where are heard the cries of despair and the curses of the poor, where manhood shrivels and possession rots down the possessor; and the other leading to the highlands of the morning, where are heard the glad shouts of humanity and where honest effort is rewarded with immortality. </em></P>
<SECTION>
<H4>-<strong>John P. Altgeld </strong></H4>
<P>s there a larger goal in life? – Yes says the Saint Kanakadasa. We all pray with our heart and soul to the Person residing in the higher abode (God) for salvation, with devotion for one’s satisfaction, strengthen the soul and attain eternal happiness. The above goals are much different than basic goals of getting food and shelter but need to coexist with them. Divinity, Soul, Devotion, Happiness belong to only human beings and not for </P>
<P>other animals. Humanity arises therefore because of such a higher purpose in life. </P>
<P>Saint Kanakadasa in that aspect was fortunate as his hunger to basic needs was very small and could be fulfilled by hunting or farming. He was a person who had learnt music &amp; literature and had realized his supreme God through this. He could attain happiness by singing prayers. Can we be in the same state or get to that? As he had complete faith in Lord Keshava (Krishna) do we have faith in any other subject? Like his goal was happiness through devotion, what is our goal? Goal is one of the forms of goodness. </P>
</SECTION>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Individual Goals </strong></H2>
<P>n this world there are innumerable people and all of them are different. Difference is not only in the physical form or appearance but also in their mannerisms and behavior. As we observe that the distribution of the various organs in the human body is in the same proportions with respect to different individuals there are subtle differences which makes us to distinctly identify. Even when the individual is not directly in front of us we are able to recognize by his voice or may also be from few mannerisms which every individual would have built. The differences are not essentially on the physical aspects but also on the other features or attributes the individual possesses such as responses of the sensual organs coupled with characteristic differences such as one being more arrogant, friendly, and compassionate or likes and dislike. At the macro level there are differences in the individual on the socio-economic aspect varying from someone being poor to extremely rich. </P>
<P>Like this, individuals across the world have some common attributes on the physical, psychological and socio-economic front and differences which makes them unique. Therefore every individual has to pretty much decide and mould his life accordingly on his own. There cannot be a single goal and single path for all individuals. One goal and one path or means to achieve it for everyone is improbable. The goal that Kanakadasa had set for himself could not be envisaged by others during his period. Goal and path to achieve that is distinct for every human being. </P>
<P>Can I identify the most appropriate goal for myself drawing inspiration from experiences of life or with help of a Guru (teacher) or through study of great books? The answer to this is all the above sources are like a huge super market. Supermarket is stuffed with variety of goods from groceries to garments, technology products to home furnishings etc. We all visit and shop based on our needs and ability to buy (money available for spend). Likewise we need to select the goal and path to achieve that by weighing the situation we are in and the competency one has. Guru or Books or experiences of life only are raw materials and function as a direction post helping the individual with various options. But, we are the individuals who need to achieve that goal and walk the path to achieve it and therefore we need to exercise our discretion here. </P>
<P>Goal gets built incrementally and can never be a onetime exercise. When we are in the house our goal is the foot of the hill, once we reach the foot the hill-top will be the goal, as we reach the hill-top, temple on the hill becomes the goal and once you reach the entrance of the temple, getting to the sanctum sanctorum becomes the goal. So goal is essentially a series of goals which gets built in this fashion. As and when we progress towards achieving a goal, a higher goal calls to be conquered. The most important process in this is identifying the first goal. In which direction should we set forth our journey becomes the fundamental question that needs to be addressed. </P>

<H2><strong>What do we mean by Good? </strong></H2>
<P>ll of us desire good things in Life. Everyone aspires for good conduct. What do we mean by good? What is good? Does whatever appears beautiful and sweet is all those good? For some, taste of liquor is sweet. Some like face which has been artificially made up with the use of cosmetics and goggles. So, can we conclude that this is goodness? What might appeal to us at one moment may look distasteful after sometime. Food that we consume out of lot of liking may actually be rendered tasteless after we are saturated with its consumption. What will decide the goodness of our likes and dislikes? What are the attributes of goodness and what is its form? </P>
<P><strong>Origin of Good or Goodness</strong> – is having the right or desirable quality. In Sanskrit the equivalent of good is Sat ()-the ideal; pure and true essence (nature) of an entity or existence in the Vedanta or alternatively or something that is eternal. </P>
<P>Sat in the context of Gita can be identified in Chapter 17, verses 26-27 as </P>
<P><em>sad-bhave sadhu-bhave c</em><em>a </em><em>sad ity etat prayujyat</em><em>e </em><em>prasaste karmani tath</em><em>a </em><em>sac-chabdah partha yujyat</em><em>e </em><em>yajne tapasi dane c</em><em>a </em></P>
<P><em>sthitih sad iti cocyat</em><em>e </em><em>karma caiva tad-arthiya</em><em>m </em><em>sad ity evabhidhiyat</em><em>e </em></P>
<P>The concept is also famously expressed in a mantra found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1.3.28), </P>
<P><em>Asato mâ sad gamaya / tamaso mâ jyotir gamaya / mrtyor mâ amrutam gamaya </em></P>
<P>“Lead me from delusion to truth; from darkness to light; from mortality to immortality” </P>
<P>Sat has been adapted as: <em>sattva</em> “purity” and <em>satya</em> “truth”. </P>
<P>A quality or feature which remains unaffected by the boundary of region and remains unchanged with reference to time can be referenced as being good. In other words a universally acceptable and agreed character can be termed as good. Above all this, the main characteristic of goodness is one that is eternal and can remain unaffected in its form. </P>
<P>Then what in our world can remain forever? All that is recognizable by our senses is changing constantly and almost in real-time. All objects living and non-living keep getting created and destroyed. In this mortal world what can be recognized and accepted as immortal? </P>
<P>All our great saints prophase that God is the only truth and eternal. Holy men and spiritual leaders in all countries and in all religions have believed that God is the only truth and does not undergo deformity. Every second innumerable changes are taking place in the world and beyond all this is hidden some supreme energy. This energy is residing in earth, sky, inanimate and animate objects of this universe working and controlling all acts from behind as the unquestionable Emperor. This supreme energy is God, Divinity, Supreme soul and Goodness. There is nothing other than this which can be considered as good. </P>
<P>That conduct, that realization, that practice and finally that experience which leads us to realization of this energy is Goodness. Any other thing which can obstruct this process can be termed as bad or evil. There is one God but his names and forms are innumerable. Likewise Goodness has only one definition and is one philosophy, its forms and effects are different. </P>
<P>Based on this, our sages have determined what is good and what is bad and this goodness has been called as noble character. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Human Purpose </strong></H2>
<P>or a human being there could be four good intentions or purposes as identified by the spiritual leaders which are i) Dharma – righteousness, duty, morality ii) Artha – wealth, prosperity iii) Kama – wish, desire iv) Moksha – liberation. Human desires, thoughts and efforts are innumerable. Whatever they may be they can be classified under any one of them. Out of these four the first three are applicable to any individual who is leading a householder’s life. </P>
<P>i) Dharma – means good conduct – it is the blossoming of the soul. We already have seen as how do we identify or define something as good. The conduct of ours which causes no harm to any individual around us, which can beautify the life of others and in the process can beautify our own life, can be termed as good conduct i.e. dharma. It should have the capability to nurture everyone’s life not of a single individual. It should also help him to uplift himself and maintain equilibrium with the society. Dharma encompasses truth, purity, righteousness &amp; empathy. Likewise it is inclusive of holy deeds such as mediation, offering prayer, rituals, sacrifices, charity &amp; social responsibility. It is challenging to comprehend the meaning of dharma in the classical context but its forms are cognizable to the mental faculty of common people. For many civilizations it has stood its ground, grown and </P>
<P>has become widely recognized. Manu’s following words serve as the standard for Dharma: </P>
<SECTION>
<H4><strong>Dhriti Kshama Damo Asteyam Shaucham Indriyanigrahah Dheer Vidya Satyam Akrodho Dashakam Dharma Lakshanam </strong></H4>
<P>The ten important features of Dharma being : (1) Dhriti – Patience, (2) Kshama – Forgiveness, (3) Damah – Self Control, (4) Asteya – Not Stealing, (5) Shaucha – Purity, (6) Indriya Nigraha – Sense Control, (7) Dhi – Intellect, (8) Vidya – Learning/ Knowledge, (9) Satya – Truth, (10) Akrodha – Absence of Anger. </P>
<P>ii. Artha (Wealth) – Artha represents money, land, gold, stones and other forms of wealth. If the right order for life is dharma then food and clothing form the foundation of it. The ways and means to earn this is in dharma. But wealth has the inherent characteristic to command things. Some kinds of foods have the ability to provide strength but they need to be consumed in limit. If we consume more we get intoxicated and so is the case with wealth. If we accumulate more than what is required for our right living then it leads to intoxication and ultimately loose dharma. So to create wealth in such a fashion is a duty according to dharma. Vedas therefore suggest not abstaining from creation of such wealth: “Boothyaiyna pramaditavyam, tatho me shriyamaavah” </P>
<P>iii) Kama – Kama means desire. It is the desire for comfort and happiness more than the admiration of life. Love, Friendship, high quality food, beauty, music, dance, and movies are all different aspects of desire. Like how a person who indulges in creation of wealth can be led to eventually deviation from dharma (righteousness) same would result in over indulgence in these desires. Desire which is unharmful has a significant place in the system of dharma. Enjoying comfort is no sin and so is experiencing happiness, but one cannot forget dharma. </P>
<P>Both wealth and desire need to function in a well-defined boundary, which means there is enough of freedom for one to exercise. Both of these are origin points for development of mental faculty and human efforts. This influences the creation and growth of human civilization which encompasses science, commerce, occupation, industries, technology, social order &amp; relationship between societies. If wealth and Kama help in expansion of life it is dharma which provides the required treatment to keep this expansion healthy. </P>
<P>iv) Moksha (Salvation) – Salvation or Nirvana as it is called in the recent times is a subject which is farfetched for experience of humans. The above three are cognizable by us in our daily life. Moksha belongs to a different class all together and gets a distinct treatment. It is specially attached to saints, individuals detached from society and spiritual leaders. Dharma, Artha and Kama create a connection and bonding to the society we all live in. This connection over a period of time makes us go through turmoil of experiences. This is the difficulty of bonding and getting released from such kind of bonding which passes through ages is salvation. For humans the thought of the supreme soul and consistent meditation on it, provides a protective shield against the sufferings he undergoes. An individual who recognizes and comprehends that supreme energy which is omnipresent has the ability to understand the value of the materialistic world and stay detached from such kind of superficial existence. The attainment of such a supreme state is called Moksha or salvation. For the purpose of this book, Moksha is not so important but has been touched upon has one of the four human purposes. </P>

<H2><strong>Our Purpose </strong></H2>
<P><em>The game of life requires all one’s energy to play it at one’s best. The present gives us the only chance we have for doing. To use it in futile grief or regret is to leave something worthwhile undone, indulge in something that does no one any good and interferes with maintaining a cheerful spirit that brings happiness to self and to others. </em></P>

<P>or our life to be fruitful and meaningful there is greater necessity to have knowledge of right goal and means to achieve it. The purpose of this book is to help charter a map which can be supportive in this journey of life. This thought and exercise is not of the easy order. Our great ancestors have no doubt left behind valuable directions in this regard but where does it stand in the era where newer technologies and science are evolving daily, newer religions and factions are getting formed and our mind is constantly getting dragged in innumerable directions shaking the established faith of life. In this technologically advanced environment we have to reexamine our challenges in life. </P>
<P>This book is not aimed at scholars but written with intention to reach out to large class of common people. Life as a whole is beyond the capabilities of human language and the roots of life’s experiences is much deeper than the root of knowledge. </P>
<P>To those scholarly readers there could be many questions that arise during the course of reading, I request you to continue reading till the end and then make a review of this writing. </P>
<P>The author’s second request is this writing is not an instant solution to your current challenges in life. Man’s life is vast and inexplicable to be captured in few words. I would rather not dare to say that through this I will be able to help you establish your purpose of life in one shot. The philosophy and premise of this book is many fold. It would be more appropriate to call it as mind’s inclination, behavior and occupation rather than philosophy. </P>
<P>As the breadth and length of the river get larger we would require more channels and pillars to build the bridge, so is the case with our life where our intellect and mind needs to take different forms to meet its challenges. Our life is a daily fight and we need to have practiced various techniques to emerge victorious. One leg is inadequate to walk and one hand is not enough for our work. Just like that one, philosophy alone doesn't suffice to stay productive in this life. This does not anyway suggest that there is something greater that will be revealed here. The attempt that is being made here is also not something that is outstanding, not a difficult one and nor challenging. To make our life self satisfactory and meaningful one we do not require some special books, we need few simple formulae which can be comprehended by us and strongly hold on to those by practicing them. The best example to such a life is that of Mahatma Gandhi. He was not a great scholar nor did he research on great works, all that he did was to have belief in few principles and live by it with higher dedication to make it fruitful. Whatever may be our philosophy or fundamental principles the key to success lies in strong belief and following it with higher commitment? It is futile to having read great works by great scholars and unable to inculcate and emulate any of them in our daily lives. </P>
<P>If we need to see improvement in state of our fellow beings then there needs to be a change in their thought process. For this the mind has to transform itself, as unless this transformation takes place none of the others can change for better. </P>

<H2><strong>Three Main Characteristics </strong></H2>
<P>irst and foremost is the devotion to life has to increase. Life is a larger object and living is an art. To lead a good life is neither a sin nor act of shame. The philosophy “To make life good and lead that in the most purposeful manner is our duty” should be deep rooted in our minds and heart. That is progress. Progress simply means upward movement in life or having a right goal and moving towards achieving it. </P>
<P>What is right or good has been the question that is addressed to a certain extent. For now let us consider all those actions accepted and acknowledged, which lead to better state of life as right or good. </P>
<P>Secondly, faith in human efforts has to increase tremendously among our fellow human beings. In the most challenging situations one has the ability to discover what is good and how to achieve that. To know that duty and put all the efforts with strength and wisdom is what is called for. Such courageous character needs to be firm in our people’s minds. Science is a result of this progressive evolution and in turn is responsible for further progress. </P>
<P>Thirdly, our daily conduct needs to be filled with sweet and friendly radiance. Humility and goodness in our conduct needs to be natural rather than that is arising out of fear towards law, society or religious institution. Good conduct should have developed because of thoughtful alliance to such characters instead of blind faith. </P>
<P>Therefore, there is need for strong inculcation of three characters : a) Enthusiasm towards Life b) Human Efforts and c) Social Network. Practical application of these are i) Progress ii) Science and iii) Humility respectively. A wholehearted belief in the above is the necessary preparation for enabling growth of civilization. </P>

<H2><strong>Present Living </strong></H2>
<P>ren’t people living like this today? Yes, they are but it is insipid and half hearted in approach. It is directionless and following herd instinct without a definitive purpose. It also appears to be unscientific, unenthusiastic and lacking any courageous act. </P>
<P>Our life is being led very mechanically lacking independent review of it and giving it a lack luster appearance. A true life should resemble that of a plant not that of a machine. Plant has everyday fresh life with new sprouts, buds and flowers. Likewise our lives need to be radiating daily with new activities and accomplishments than appearing dull and boring. If we are not breathing freshness to our life through our individual efforts and thinking, it is as good as we are dead. </P>
<P>The irony of our country today is any one we meet is constantly talking about god, holy men, holy scriptures, supreme energy, being truthful and non-violence but is completely absent in their actions and practices. This leaves us with irreconcilable situation between our speech and conduct. Why is there such a disconnect ? </P>
<P>If we look geographically India is blessed to have vast land which is fertile, abundant natural resources, long coastal lines and more importantly large population with majority of people having reasonable intelligence that can be put into use. </P>
<P>In spite of this, we are having sizeable population still living below the poverty line, many households suffering from chronic diseases and people who are clueless about tomorrow’s living. On one hand we are talking about economic progress being made through growth of service industries but unable to bring in innovation and take advantage of it, we are marketing medical tourism but unable to provide adequate healthcare system to needy. All this leads us to when and how do we become self-reliant and strong? </P>

<H2><strong>Reason for Slow Growth of this Nation? </strong></H2>
<P>he reasons and excuses for our slow growth or under achievement for these many years are dime and dozen. </P>
<P>Few of them attribute to the colonial rule that we were subjected to for more than three centuries, some of them point to our society divided on caste, creed, religion, economy and lack of co-operation and few others accuse the lack of application of science and technology in the early years of our independence. Yes, all the above and few other reasons may have impacted our journey of growth but what is more shocking and disappointing is when people surrender accepting all this as one’s fate and God’s will. </P>

<H2><strong>Life’s Enthusiasm </strong></H2>
<P>e should first identify the lacuna or defect in us which upon correction can lead us to eradicate all other difficulties. This can act only through ruthless act of introspection or self discovery. If we do this we will recognize that for generations together we have rendered our mind weak, unwisely detached from action and have lost all the courage and energy. We have to transform this weak mind to a stronger one. </P>
<P>It is also not that there have never been attempts to improve the quality of life. India has seen visionaries such as Sir M Visweswaraiah, Dr. Verghese Kurien, Vikram Sarabhai, Prof. Satish Dhawan, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and others who have effectively used the government structure, system and policies to reach out to common man and uplift their quality of life. We have created world class organizations in the last two decades in areas of Information Technology &amp; Bio-technology through leadership of Narayan Murthy, Azim Premji, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Ratan Tata to name a few. There is also a huge spurt in the entrepreneurship across sectors which is an encouraging sign and can hold a promising future for this country. But, what is more important is for a nation with current size of population and ever growing, there needs to be a multifold effort and reforms that need to take place in the hearts and minds of every citizen of this country. Any country which has progressed well has done not merely because of its leaders but the positive energy kindled in every heart and mind of its citizen which </P>

<H2><strong>A Formidable Story </strong></H2>
<P>n the city of Kalyanpur there lived a wealthy person who had constructed a huge bungalow and had got a well dug in its premises. They couldn’t find water in spite of having dug for 70 – 80 ft in the ground. As he was pondering what to do with it, situation had arrived for him to meet his lawyer friend in city of Chennai and at the same time this friend was considering to settle down in Kalyanpur for reasons of health. The friend asked the wealthy person whether he could help him to locate a nice bungalow for him and also insisted that he needed one which has a well that could be used for some religious activities. The wealthy person responded said that he was aware of a newly constructed bungalow of someone he knew and it indeed had a well whose water was very sweet. So the friend indicated to him that he would visit the following Saturday for looking at the bungalow in Kalyanpur. Meanwhile the wealthy person put all the effort to fill the well to a substantial level with clean and sweet water. Finally the bungalow was sold for a huge amount. Within weeks of the friend occupying the bungalow, water in the well started drying up and after few more weeks the water completely dried up. How long can a well have water which has been artificially pumped from an external source? </P>
<P>A human’s life and country’s prospect is also similar. They cannot sustain and grow from the support received by friends or the external borrowings from neighbors. Energy needs to take birth and grow from within or else any magnitude of help received from outside will not help. Like spring of water in the well, energy and enthusiasm needs to constantly spring out and drive the individual and the country. </P>
<P>It is bewildering to see only few human beings taking such a initiative and leaders of country not having a big heart and higher aspirations to accomplish that is beneficial for everyone. </P>

<H2><strong>Voice of Great Saints </strong></H2>
<P>mong all the works that have been in the world, Vedas have been recognized as the most ancient work. We do not get any indication of a fragile and weak mind but on the contrary it clearly voices strength, courage and determination. The prayers rendered by the great saints during this period is as follows: “Oh God! We need to live, provide us with longevity, let our ears keep hearing the most auspicious things, let our tongue taste the most delicious food, let our minds be brimming with enthusiasm, let our speech be strong, let our intellect be vibrant, let we have the best physical ability, let our enemies loose and flee, let our wealth grow and let the productivity of food and cows increase. Oh god! Let you be served by us hundreds of years with rejoice and happiness, let us get adequate rain at right times, let the productivity of field increase, let us not get affected by diseases, give us objects of enjoyment”. Such was the Aryan race’s enthusiasm towards life, self-confidence, aspiration to be victorious; they never exhibited any signs of despair, frustration and disinterest. They always considered adventurous journey filled with energy and courage. </P>
<P>Our ancestors such a thought process does not mean they did not have challenges in life. In midst of such prayers they always witnessed natural disasters, atrocious human behavior, fear of enemies, loss of hope, poverty, illness, separation and death. At one end there was birth of life’s aspirations in different forms and at the other end there was accumulation of difficulties and hardships. At this juncture Holy Scriptures of India (Vedas) originated. What lies at the inner crest of our life? What lies beyond that is visible to our human eyes? What is there inside each of us? Where is the food for this river called life? Who holds the strings and controls spring of energy that is seen in our life? Where does the Sun come from? How are seasons controlled? What is death and what lies beyond it? – These are the questions that might have posed for a very long time on which human minds have debated and the result of which is seen as the summary of Upanishads. </P>
<P>Such debates continued for a fairly long time and in the process gave birth to different religions. Some people believed and declared rituals and sacrifices as supreme. Some of them considered customs and practices to be great and while some others meditation and penance. Few considered family and charity as greater and others detachment from social system. There was also those believed in each of the above philosophies and considered them to have individual significance based on place and time. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Era of Loss of Courage </strong></H2>
<P>ike this when different religions which started and continued their journeys in different directions it might have witnessed drastic changes. Any religion or philosophy cannot grow getting confined inside a cave as it has to set its sight on the human civilization. Religion is there to create a social order in this world and world should not be created for sake of religion. Every establisher of religion may have found the necessity for a new religion by observing the social conditions present then. The greatest motivation for him was from the dissatisfaction seen in the society. There seems to be a major shakeup which took place around 2500 years in the social system of our ancestors and this could be the reason for transforming a mind which was having a winning attitude to one of losing one. </P>
<P>There could be many reasons which could have led to such a big change in the social system. Natural disasters, politically led activities, invasions and attacks of the foreigners, prolonged famine may have contributed to shattering of the human mind. When the mind mellowed down a great person may have taken birth whose high intellect or mesmerizing oratory skills or noble conduct or some other human influence could have risen him to fame and he could have shown a new vision and have led people in that direction. This should have occurred even before the era of Mahavir or Gautama Buddha. Voice of joy and happiness of the Aryan race came down and voice of helplessness gained momentum. </P>
<P>The other reason could have been prolonged indulgence in the enjoyment of victory and luxury leading to lack of practice of positive energy giving way to hardships and difficulties and eventually creating a changed mindset. Let us all recollect a common experience of the world. A person who was born poor attains wealth and fame in society because of his intellectual capabilities and physical effort. When he dies he leaves the family in the wealth and comfort created by him. If we assume that his children also engage in further growth of wealth, in the following generations of his grandchildren or great-grandchildren they start neglecting the primary attributes for creation of this wealth and also fail to put their individual effort. Further, all these result in enjoyment of created wealth, animosity among the family members, unhappiness finally getting engulfed in poverty and decline. As is the famous quote “Seeds of failure are embedded in the greatest moments of success” so will be the attitude of people who have been gifted with success and wealth rather than they would have deservingly earned. It could be therefore suggested that our ancestors who had toiled hard to create a mind of strength and courage was uprooted by the later generations and developed a mindset of defeat. </P>
<P>Long before the period of Sri Adi Shankaracharya (prior to 800 AD), enthusiasm had decreased in life and thinking such as this living world is inferior, human life gets afflicted with difficulties, human body and sensual pleasures are condemning, enjoyment is sin and not to be expected and if there is anything that is real it is the external world and even superior to this is Moksha or salvation, had crept in. </P>
<P>“End this human birth and cycle of such creations” is the song that is being taught to us by our elders. </P>

<H2><strong>Fallacies of Vedanta </strong></H2>
<P>his world is creation of Brahma and is completely under his influence, every living being in its primary form is a reflection of Brahman, if man lives with wisdom it might be possible for him to realize this higher form, purposeful living with right thinking is good and not bad has been preached in Upanishads. But this preaching never got into hearts and minds of common people. All works of Sri Adi Shankaracharya are in Sanskrit. All works which originated later can be grouped into a) works of scholars and b) works of commoners. Works of scholars were in Sanskrit and that of the commoners were in the colloquial languages such as Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu etc. The differences in these two groups of works are not at the level of language but in the nature of its subject. Scholarly embellished works were based on the commentaries of Shankaracharya or others; they were logically oriented, grammatically correct and meaningfully presented. There are few works which claim as the exact thoughts of Sri Adi Shankaracharya and few others which decry the same and argue against it. In response to this there are few which reclaim the first one and others which recommends denial of what Sri Adi Shankarcharya has proposed. Likewise we can find innumerable arguments in favor and against which are logically based. </P>
<P>In the texts of commoners we find more discussion on as to which of the above thought process or philosophies is more sacred. </P>
<P>This human body is dry log of wood, why such ornamentation to this body, attachments to wife and children is like a puppet show, why such interest and dedication to them, world is but an illusion, life is a bubble, to claim human effort is exaggeration everything is fate driven and determined by our past actions, happiness is a dream, beauty is a mirage and it is futile to put efforts in this context. One cannot escape from what fate brings and one cannot create which is not in our fate. </P>
<P><em>Janma dukham jara dukham, jaaya dukham punah punaha ! Samsara saagaram dukham, Sarvam dukhamayam jagath !! </em></P>
<P>This Vedanta is downtrodden and helpless. The songs sung by holy disciples of Hari and Shiva, historical stories narrated enumerating and effecting tears in eyes of listeners are all in praise of such misery laden detachment. People who have been canvassing such a philosophy have failed to remember that by making such an argument we are just accusing the creator. People who are at all times experiencing hardships develop liking towards such philosophy as they get some comfort in the words expressed there. To escape from this ocean of difficulties the only path is through fasting. One has to ill treat his body, chant hymns of god, sacrificing the world, not eat stomach full and not earn enough to completely once miseries. This is reaching to a stage where one is living life of half dead unable to leave life completely and unable to commit suicide. They constantly chant to end their life. </P>

<H2><strong>Courageous Intellect </strong></H2>
<P> journey which embarked to seek victory and satisfy aspirations of life by Vedas gradually led to think about external philosophy and divided it into two branches. One branch which relied on logic reached desert and dried up. The other one has travelled like a flood encompassing everything on its way. It is our duty for us to research and identify the river which existed before this branch out and lead it into our life. Therefore let us look at the Upanishads. </P>
<P>One is Ishopanishad which states as: </P>
<P>“This world is embedded in God. Therefore all this is property of God. In this context you should not presume anything as yours; you should use it treating all this as his divine gift. You are entitled to receive that based on the work you perform. For that reason you need to perform well. Give me the mind to live for hundred years by performing the work with all wisdom and enthusiasm and eat </P>
<P>the fruits gifted by the Lord.” </P>
<P>The other is Taittiriya Upanishad which says as follows: </P>
<P>“Be cautious not to commit mistake in comprehending truth or speaking truth. Behave similarly with respect to Dharma. Be alert in achieving whatever is good. Conduct yourself well in the righteous manner in creation of wealth, with respect to elders, with relatives and friends and let your actions be filled with wise knowledge. Let you create abundantly food grains and other materials required for life. All things which have form and substance are all part of God. Therefore if you consider all transactions and business as service to God, divine gift of God then you will experience and reach abode of God. </P>
<P>Bhagavad-Gita which is considered as the essence (or summarized text) of all Upanishads says the following: </P>
<P>“If you have to fight for Dharma, go out, stand and fight; do not run away from situation. Dharma means principle of holding all living things in a state of equilibrium. If you fight for your personal benefit or cause you will get imprisoned in it. A person who sacrifices the attitude of 'I', 'It’s mine', 'My happiness', 'My welfare', 'My prestige', 'My name' and works for the well being of everyone will have all his obstacles removed and enable growth of his soul. Entire world is filled with Brahman. If you work with intention of benefiting the society and as an offering to God, it will bring you prosperity. Therefore lead your life for the world; experience and tolerate victory and loss with equal measure. Analyze the situation and act. Work and be victorious as a disciple of Lord Shiva.” </P>
<P>Such a mental attitude is what is primarily required. </P>

<H2><strong>Importance of Life </strong></H2>
<P>ife is a huge subject. It is most sacred and deserves all respect. For a life to germinate and take its birth the creator would have made many preparations prior to it. We need to constantly rethink about it. In plants, in lizards, snakes, reptiles, fishes and other animals there are strange mechanisms devised by nature to enable reproduction. Human body is an astonishing machine. It is filled with chemical elements which drive it, chemicals such as human mind. It is created with various such mechanisms, hard labor of patience and love by God. To call that inferior and ignoring is not a wisely act. To respect this life and lead it to a good position with all possible efforts is a dharmishta (follower of dharma). Every life is a hidden treasure of innumerable energies. A life, whose such hidden or inherent energy gets enriched, strengthened and becomes available for welfare of mankind will become successfully complete. Therefore it is inappropriate to be unenthusiastic with respect to life. There has to be devotion and interest with respect to all matters of life. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Inappropriate Detachment </strong></H2>
<P>ongs of philosophy, hymns about various gods, verses written by servants of god all preach detachment which is inappropriate and easily attainable. Such a detachment is restricted to words and of complete inaction. It only helps to build laziness, cowardly seclusion and detachment born out of inability. “Nothing is possible from me; everything is controlled and managed by someone else. What is the use of you struggling? Do not strain yourselves unnecessarily; just sit and keep meditating on God” is the common thing preached by divine songs of god. Added to this are the songs of dejection which proclaim “what is the point in comforting this human body equivalent to log of wood?” In the very first instance people are facing hardships and are subjected to poverty and on top of it if this so called divine songs preach “do not worry about what’s happening, you be where you are as what can you accomplish you are just a human being” they get easily influenced to them leaving behind their responsibilities and duties. Such is the intoxication provided by the commoner’s philosophy. </P>
<P>Detachment means to forego the selfish interest in worldly things. “Nothing is mine, everything belongs to God”, not to beg for ones’ own comfort, not troubling any one is real detachment and such a detachment is purified by wisdom. But, for a person where there is nothing in this world that belongs to him and is toiling hard daily to satiate his stomach, where can he find detachment? If he wants to have detachment from life (breadth or life giving force) the life itself does not allow happening and demands to be with the human body. Apart from life there is nothing that a poor person can sacrifice and be detached from life. If you have not kept anything for yourself then there is nothing to be sacrificed and so a poor man does not have anything at his disposal for sacrifice. Preaching detachment to such a person is futile and would be adding to agony of his life. Feeding the patient with food which is tasteful to tongue and advising poor people to sit idle would be leading them to misery and not out of it. </P>
<P>We should first stop cribbing about our Fate and develop a courageous outlook. Bring smiles back to our face giving up crying, weak and loosing mind should be replaced with intellect to win, cowardly detachment should go and valiant effort should come in. </P>

<H2><strong>What do we mean by Devotion to God? </strong></H2>
<P>oes it mean that we do not require devotion to God? It is a redundant question. No one is saying that we do not require devotion to God. But, the question here is in understanding the right kind of devotion. Devotion means display of holy ash, vermilion, necklace of holy beads, traditional trident, sacred pendants is the thinking of many people. Endless chanting of Rama, Shiva (Hindu Gods) and singing holy songs at temples are the main characteristics of devotion is the opinion of few. These practices and principles are bad and are futile is not anyone’s contention. But our stance is these are not sufficient. Let there be singing of divine songs and wearing of holy objects as this might provide some kind of solace and strength to few human minds. Just as we decorate our houses with colorful paints, flowers and leaves during festival and auspicious occasions, holy chanting and ornamentation can bring some radiance to life. But decoration alone does not make it a festival there needs to be some good food prepared in the house for the occasion. This means devotion needs to have more of wisdom driven efforts along with holy chanting. Devotion does not mean mental turbulence alone but also include human efforts. Devotion means an emotion which originates from heart and emerges out of our throat is an old feeling. Devotion is energy of soul that originates in our head and gets out through our hands is our opinion. The seat of devotion is heart is a thinking of past, </P>
<SECTION>
<H5><strong>What do we mean by Devotion to God? </strong></H5>
<P>devotion’s one foot is in heart and the other is in our intellect is our thinking. Devotion should reach God is the belief of past, devotion is created by God, he is a witness to it and it should reach the human world is our opinion. It does not suffice if devotion evokes good words from our mouth but it should elicit good work from us. That good work should have the capability to serve larger part of society we live in. We believe human effort is main component of devotion. </P>
<P>If we observe in this limelight just as we regard Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa, Saint Kabir, Basavanna, Nijaguna Shivayogi, as great devotees in the same league are Kempegowda (founder of Bengaluru), Dadabhai Naoroji, Ranade, Rangacharlu, Gokhale, Tilak, Gandhi, JC Bose, P C Ray, J N Tata, Sir M Visweswaraiah who have rendered yeoman services to society. People who have created better constitution and government, who have worked for upliftment of poor, people who were responsible for spread of science and technology, establishment of research and development centers thereby fostering newer technologies, developed new machines and intellectual property for benefit of society should also be considered as devotees. If one’s devotion is expressed through tears, devotion of other’s is through strengthened efforts. </P>
<P>We should approve mental attitude which is supported by science and human capabilities that is responsible for such a cognizable devotion. </P>

<H2><strong>What is Science? </strong></H2>
<P><em>In their essence there can be no conflict between science and religion. Science is a reliable method of finding truth. Religion is the search for a satisfying basis for life…. Yet a world that has Science needs, as never before, the inspiration that religion has to offer…. Beyond the nature taught by science is the spirit that gives meaning to life. </em></P>
<SECTION>
<H4>-<strong>Dr. Arthur H. Compton </strong></H4>
<P>he purpose of science is to question about this universe, experiment, research and search for answers to why is this? How is this? The knowledge that results out of such a search is Science. Without becoming a blind faith, knowledge which originates of independent thinking and review is Science. </P>
<P>Students of Science need to work primarily in three areas: </P>
<ol>
<LI>Different forms of object </LI>
<LI>Classification of objects </LI>
<LI>Inter-relationship between objects </LI>
</ol>
<P>1. Every object in this universe needs to be analyzed for its form, size, weight, color, properties, fundamental elements which the object is made of and their behavioral nature. So, the fundamental duty of science is gathering data of each of the above parameters and analyzing them. </P>
<ol>
<LI>Second duty of science is classification of objects based on the properties and creating taxonomy. At the broad level they can be classified as living and non-living. In living you have terrestrial, aquatic, amphibians, living in air; in terrestrial we have humans, animals, insects and so on as specific classes; in non-living we have metals, salts, gases, fuels and so forth as special classes. Such a systematic classification enables us to reasonably understand and recognize the basic features and properties of most of objects. </LI>
<LI>Such diversely classified objects influence each other by enhancing, negating, decreasing the fundamental properties of the other object and work of science is to reason out as to how and why this happens. Such a mutually influencing phenomenon between objects has transformed this universe into a great place and has divinely held together. The intricate study of such inter-relationship has been helpful tool and utility in our daily life. </LI>
</ol>
<P>Science is such a vast subject which is growing daily and ever expanding. The main feature of science is its independent examination of subject. Fearless and Unbiased research of Universe is Science. </P>
<P>Inter-relationships between objects are infinite and therefore there is a limitation in our effort for understanding this as it is. Therefore science needs to endlessly continue its pursuit of truth and can never claim that it has reached its goal. Such a goal is a temporary destination with respect to time, environment and capabilities of the researcher. </P>

<H2><strong>Natural Sciences </strong></H2>
<P>cience can be mainly classified as i) Natural Sciences ii) Social Science. </P>
<P>In science, the term natural science refers to a naturalistic approach to the study of the universe, which is understood as obeying rules or laws of natural origin. It encompasses everything from human life to study of stars and planets. It helps us to analyze the formation, fundamental composition, principles of each object and its behavior towards other objects. To appreciate the capabilities of this we need to here recollect and name few of the accomplishments from it: </P>
<P>a) All forms of transportation vehicles – land, air and water. </P>
<P>b) Electricity and innumerable electrical appliances. </P>
<P>c) Communication from Telegraph to the latest mobile </P>
<P>gadgets. d) Photography and all its advancements in cinematography. e) Early form of printing press to the latest technologies in </P>

<P>The list can go on endlessly and science has impacted mankind to a large extent in every sphere of life and it is unlikely that today an individual is unaffected by at least one of them. All such advancements in Science and Technology have fostered and helped creation of God. Are we in a position to refute this statement? </P>
<P>There could be few of them which have been put to use by certain section of people in favor of personal greed rather than helping mankind. But, where doesn’t such a personal greed exist; we have seen them in few saints, so called holy men and spiritual gurus. This does not mean all the saints; holy men and spiritual teachers can be defamed. Isn’t earning livelihood one’s duty? Is there harm in working and earning for one’s livelihood? The important thing here is about work and not about livelihood. Father of physics Newton; English naturalist and propose of theory of evolution Charles Darwin; pioneer of antiseptic surgery Joseph Lister; French Chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur; Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt; inventor of spinning frame Richard Arkwright; inventor of telegraph Thomas Alva Edison and many such people have used their intellect to serve human society and in process have worshipped God. </P>
<P>Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology and astronomy. </P>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Physics </strong></H3>
<P>Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the universe, the forces and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on mathematics as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles. </P>
<P>Key historical developments in physics include Isaac Newton’s theory of universal gravitation and classical mechanics, an understanding of electricity and its relation to magnetism, Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity, the development of thermodynamics, and the quantum mechanical model of atomic and subatomic physics The field of physics. is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, applied physics and optics. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Chemistry </strong></H3>
<P>Constituting the scientific study of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as gases, molecules, crystals, and metals. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms for use in larger-scale applications. Some of the useful applications of this have been in manufacturing of drugs, fertilizers, dyes and paints. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Biology </strong></H3>
<P>This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from subcomponent biophysics up to complex ecologies. </P>
<P>Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification and behaviors of organisms, as well as how species were formed and their interactions with each other and environment. </P>
<P>The biological fields of botany, zoology, and medicine date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Earth Science </strong></H3>
<P>Earth science (also known as geosciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth, including geology, geophysics, hydrology, meteorology, physical geography, oceanography, and soil science. </P>
<P>Earth sciences today are closely linked to climate research and the petroleum and mineral exploration industries. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Engineering </strong></H3>
<P>Engineering is the discipline, art, skill and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes that safely realize improvements to the lives of people. </P>
</SECTION>

<H3><strong>Medicine </strong></H3>
<P>Medicine is the science and art of healing. It encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. </P>
<P>Contemporary medicine applies health science, biomedical research, and medical technology to diagnose and treat injury and disease, typically through medication, surgery, or some other form of therapy. </P>
<P>Even people who are residing in the rural areas are completely cognizant of the benefits of the mankind has derived from the above disciplines. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3><strong>Social Science </strong></H3>
<P>Let us now look at Social Science. The Social Sciences are the fields of scholarship that study society. “Social Science” is commonly used as an umbrella term to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the natural sciences. </P>
<P>These include: anthropology, archaeology, business administration, criminology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, sociology, international relations, communication, and, in some contexts, history, law, and psychology. </P>
<P><strong>a) Political Science – </strong>What do we understand by a State and what do we understand by its Government, what are the components of it; what should be the relation between government and its citizens; duties of government; reaction of public to wrong doings of the government; inter-state relationships; where is the main strength of the government; how should the system be structured if the government is to be likeable by its citizens. Political science also studies power in international relations and the theory of Great powers and Superpowers. </P>
<P><strong>b) Economics </strong>- Economics is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. Economics has two broad branches: microeconomics, where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and macroeconomics, where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. </P>
<P><strong>c) Treasury (Rajyakosha)</strong> – It deals with income and expenditure with respect to government. It includes various taxes, duties, levies and such other. </P>
<P><strong>d) Currency (Control and Production) </strong>- In economics, currency refers to a generally accepted medium of exchange. These are usually the coins and banknotes of a particular government, which comprise the physical aspects of a nation’s money supply. The other part of a nation’s money supply consists of bank deposits (sometimes called deposit money), ownership of which can be transferred by means of cheques, debit cards, or other forms of money transfer. Deposit money and currency are money in the sense that both are acceptable as a means of payment. Money in the form of currency has predominated in human civilizations from about 10,000 BCE. In most cases, each private central bank has monopoly control over the supply and production of its own currency. To facilitate trade between these currency zones, there are different exchange rates, which are the prices at which currencies (and the goods and services of individual currency zones) can be exchanged against each other. Currencies can be classified as either floating currencies or fixed currencies based on their exchange rate regime. </P>
<P><strong>e) Financial Institutions</strong> - In financial economics, a financial institution is an institution that provides financial services for its clients or members. Probably the most important financial service provided by financial institutions is acting as financial intermediaries. </P>
<P>Most financial institutions are highly regulated by government. Financial institutions provide service as intermediaries of financial markets. They are responsible for transferring funds from investors to companies in need of those funds. Financial institutions facilitate the flow of money through the economy. </P>
<P><strong>f) Distribution of wealth –</strong> is a comparison of the wealth of various members or groups in a society. It differs from the distribution of income in that it looks at the distribution of ownership of the assets in a society, rather than the current income of members of that society. </P>
<P><strong>g) Jurisprudence –</strong> Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law. Scholars of jurisprudence, or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th Century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be broken into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best to be answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: </P>
<P>1) Problems internal to law and legal systems as such. </P>
<P>2) Problems of law as a particular social institution as it relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists. </P>
<P><em>h) </em><strong>Sociology –</strong> Sociology is the study of society. It is a social science-a term with which it is sometimes synonymous-which uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop and refine a body of knowledge about human social activity. For many sociologists the goal is to conduct research which may be </P>
<P>applied directly to social policy and welfare, whilst others produce purely academic theory closer to that of philosophy. Subject matter ranges from the micro level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure. Sociology is a very broad discipline. Its traditional focuses have included social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, and deviance. As all spheres of human activity are sculpted by social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects, such as health, medical, military and penal institutions, the Internet, and even the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge. </P>
<P><strong>i) Statistics -</strong>Statistics is the study of the collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of data. It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. It is used to understand the distribution of society in terms of physical, financial and mental health. </P>
<P><strong>j) Psychology</strong> is the science of behavior and mental processes. Its immediate goal is to understand individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases. For many, the ultimate goal of psychology is to benefit society. In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist, and can be classified as a social scientist, behavioral scientist, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and neuro-biological processes that underlie certain functions and behaviors. Psychology incorporates research from the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities, such as philosophy. </P>
<P>Like this Science has taken hundreds of forms and transforming lives of individuals in thousands of ways. Science is a result of human’s mental faculty. Application of Science is fruit of human efforts. Everyday hundreds of researchers, scientists, technologists are constantly experimenting and innovating taking forward Science as a discipline. If we look at advancements and revolution taking place in lives because of technological progress happening in countries of Europe, America, Japan and India one cannot undermine the human efforts. We can let go of such a Science but have to intelligently and cautiously make it a part of our life. </P>

<H2><strong>Limitation of Science </strong></H2>
<P>obody can claim everything is possible through Science. There are many questions beyond the realm of Science and is left unanswered. The mystery surrounding the basic tenet of life and mind is yet unconquered by science. With all the technology advancements in science in Europe it couldn’t prevent the world wars and destruction to mankind. Everybody agrees that only strengthening Science is insufficient for positive progress of society and at the same time we need to agree that we can’t let go of it. </P>
<P>Science is just a tool like Weapon or Wealth. Weapon can be used to protect lives and at the same time is put into use by criminals to kill; weapon by itself is neither good nor bad. Good or bad is dependent on the hands in which it rests. Wealth similarly can be used for charity and to create violence it all depends on the individual prudence. </P>
<P>Just because a few ill intentioned people use wealth for wrong causes no one aspires to be poor. As weapons have been put into use for mass destruction by Western countries we cannot refrain from building such technologies. </P>
<P>Goodness without strength is a cry of helplessness. Mother has natural love towards her child but when the child is ill; her crying will do no good or cure its illness. At that point of time presence of mind of mother to get an able doctor saves child. It is not mother’s cry but power of science which proves to be appropriate. We first require wisdom than the God’s kindness. How did the difficulty or challenge arise and what is the right response for it is result of scientific research. We should therefore take up all our life’s questions and review it in most scientific manner. </P>
<P>Ethiopia, historically known as Abyssinia was a country with good citizens whose patriotism was no lesser than any other country’s citizens. They were naturally courageous people but all they lacked was scientific advancement. On October 3<SPAN><Sup>rd</Sup></SPAN> 1935, Italian army under leadership of Benito Mussolini attacked Ethiopia. War experts had predicted that Mussolini would require four lakh soldiers and four years to conquer this country. But on May 5<SPAN><Sup>th</Sup></SPAN> 1936, Italy was successful in establishing its dominance over Ethiopia. Ethiopia had natural defense in its mountains, forests, valleys and land terrain which made it difficult for soldiers but Italy with a small army strongly supported by latest defense equipments such as aircrafts and other machinery was victorious in seven months. The greatest lesson learnt from this is no amount of natural resources and ability will be sufficient without backing up of Science and Technology. </P>
<P>Even today in few parts of India when they are attacked by diseases such as Cholera, Chicken Pox people in villages rush to temple of goddess rather than getting it attended by physicians. One needs to understand that without disturbing one’s faith it is equally important to get help of science. </P>

<H2><strong>Pump and Pray </strong></H2>
<P>ew Englishmen were travelling in a mid-sized ship. The ship suddenly encountered huge waves and storm which made water rush into the ship. Sailors got frightened by this and becoming directionless went to Father who was sitting on deck and sought help. Father asked them what should he do and everyone said that they all need to pray together and he should lead them. Father quickly responded why they had become so dejected and ignored them. After sometime the voices of sailors seeking help became even more prominent. Father than advised, Pray but, keep pumping the water and pray. This may just be a story but lesson for us is “God helps those who help themselves”. Self effort and God’s help are interwoven and they cannot stand alone. Human beings have been gifted by God with intellect. This entrusts him with responsibility to effectively use this intellect. But men cannot shift this responsibility back to God’s shoulders it is uncalled for. Men have to execute their responsibility and leave the rest to God. </P>

<H2><strong>Science – Boon or Bane </strong></H2>
<P>s we require medicine to cure us from diseases, likewise application of science is essential to solve every other challenge of life. We have effectively used this technology to provide information for farmers in selection of seeds, fertilizers, irrigation techniques, and climatic warnings and how to preserve the harvest. This has helped us to transform the yield in several years but there is far more scope for penetration of tools and techniques for continued growth. </P>
<P>Garment industry has transformed itself in last six decades of independence from traditional industry to use of sophisticated machinery. Human power with textile machineries has made it possible for India to become leading exporters ($ 24 billion in 201011). </P>
<P>India today has witnessed global manufacturing and services industries set up their research and production facilities which have boosted economic lives of its people and access to latest technologies. </P>
<P>In this context we have to recognize and stress the role of teachers across country to create a sharp mindset of adapting to Science and Technology for betterment of society. We need to have a scientific order and temperament in every household. </P>
<P>World has witnessed unimaginable spurt in newer technologies in last three decades as internet and mobile are gaining ground in every house. We have successfully used this to make travel arrangements, take timely medical help and make business worldwide sitting in the remote corners of this country. We are yet to see unleash of far better technologies which can improve our quality of life. </P>
<P>In the same breadth what we also have to bring to our cognizance is just as we see Science can achieve greater things it is not free of boundary. Science is more an extrinsic phenomenon and can change things external to us. It has more power and control on our senses. But, what is farfetched to these sensual organs is our inner world. We can only take a guess at working of inner world but will not be able to measure through scientific instruments. If we break open our brain we will not be able to find any trace of our thought process and nor there is a way to get a microscopic view of what is happening in an individual’s brain. In this manner what is transacting in one’s heart is only a guess but not visible to anyone to prove it. This makes it difficult for science to answer to take us to root of our life. </P>
<P>In the beginning of Scientific Era, looking at success received by Science, few people felt that there is nothing impossible that cannot be achieved by science. But, in 50-60 years it was realized that it is inappropriate to have such over ambitious goals. There are many mysteries which are inexplicable through Science is an accepted fact by many renowned scientists. There are no theories in science to explain concept of soul, God, Karma (causal act - cycle of cause and effect). There are many scientists who are experimenting around this but it is hard to find a consensus among them to define any of this. There have been more of logical arguments and counter arguments. Subject which is invisible to eyes of science is philosophy which is nothing but Vedanta or spiritual science. It deals with <SPAN>God, Good, Evil (Bad), Heaven, Hell, life after death, interrelationship between souls, result of previous action, salvation and other such mystic things. </SPAN></P>
<P>In this way there is something mysterious that is external to science but attached to it. To be more precise, Science in itself holds many mysterious things which are not alien to Vedas or Vedanta. There are things which are explicit and implicit in sway of God. The supreme object is having form as well is formless. According to Vedanta it is mutable and immutable. Accordingly there are things which human intellect can comprehend and which are incognizant. It is our duty to stretch ourselves as much as possible putting in the best efforts. It is also our duty to acknowledge and accept those things as God’s intent which is unattainable in spite of his efforts. In a wise man’s path both scientific effort and patience to destiny are interwoven. In his life courage and detachment stay connected. For his faith, self-confidence is one eye and the other is devotion to God. </P>
<P>We can visualize a situation which involves power of science, devotion to God and human intellect. If someone in our house is inflicted with a disease what do we do? We will consult among family and friends and visit a capable and efficient doctor. The ability to consult, search and identify the appropriate doctor is human intellect. After thorough examination of the patient, doctor prescribes the necessary medicine and advices him to consume the same in a prescribed manner. This is power of Science. We advice the patient to trust the doctor and follow doctor’s prescription as what is required to get cured along with medicines is the mental strength and belief in doctor’s advice. Mind has control over body and hence they also represent a part of medicine. With this sentiment our ancestors said : </P>
<P><em>“Oushadham Jaahnavi Toyam Vaidyo Narayano Harihi”</em>. This medicine is holy water (Ganges) and doctor who has prescribed it is God himself. This is a congregation of Intellect-Science-Devotion. </P>
<P>As we have one dimension as human effort, second as the scientific knowledge, the third dimension is morality. That is Goodness and that is <em>dharma</em> (righteousness). <em>Dharma</em> or Righteousness is a conduct which results in reduction of torment among the living beings and increase of mutual co-operation in life. All living beings whose human conduct follows an order or assumes a well accepted social relation is <em>dharma</em>. If scientific intellect combines itself with consciousness of <em>dharma</em> then there will be glow of life. </P>
<P>As Ethiopia is a witness to a country which was high on moral grounds or righteousness but lacked scientific temperament or knowledge, so was Germany in pre-world war era which had all the necessary scientific knowledge but lacked righteousness. Both of them lead to disasters. The constant war to own most powerful weapons by countries in World and cold war in other countries is a proof for scientific advancement without righteousness. </P>
<P>India fortunately has traversed this path in a well balanced model of scientific growth coupled with disarmament for destruction. But what is disheartening is to see sporadic events of violence in various parts of country or using the scientific advancements for unlawful benefits. We have become susceptible to use ways and means which appear easy to be employed to gain on personal front. We easily emulate their mannerisms and behavior that looks convenient but fail to understand the core values present in their philosophy or their ethos. </P>

<H2><strong>Distress of Villages </strong></H2>
<P><SPAN>here is an important thing that needs to be said to people residing in villages. People speaking at political rallies and news journalists have a practice to describe rural citizens as highly innocent. They are uneducated, therefore are innocent, free of deceit and are honest are the general praise showered on them. This is a matter of exaggeration. People who graze cattle are not embedded with kindness and innocence of them. There was a time when our ancestors did their transactions keeping Sun and Moon as the witness, taking oath keeping one’s hand on the other and were retracting to swear untruth in front of idols in temple. That era is far behind us now. There are ample people who are aware of law and few lawyers in every nook and corner of the country. Lawyers are dime and dozen who offer advice at convenience and therefore people in villages take the superficial knowledge of law as sufficient for them. Over and above the ethical conduct has two dangers I) they are economically backward and there is a natural urge to somehow make money as there is saying <em>“ Daridra doshena karothi papam”</em>, because of poverty we are instigated to create sin. II) Sense of social ignominy is also less among ruralites than the urbanites. Conduct of the urbanites cannot escape the public attention and getting into news. Transactions in villages happen secretly and are never published. For these reasons untruth, deceit, cunningness and superficial behavior are not uncommon in villages. One can find </SPAN>lot of such evidence lying in courts rural areas. There are ample incidents of group clashes and violence which have retarded the growth of villages. All these are not part of moral conduct. </P>
<P>As we showcase and uphold the bad character of ruralites we should not forget that their teachers and leaders are urbanites. As the universal opinion prevails that urbanites are most civilized and supreme beings, it is but natural for our rural population to emulate them. Our urban society’s main feature is to dwell in glory of wealth </P>
<P>– which strongly believes money alone has the capability to buy anything in this world and lives with this false prestige. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Agrarian Economy </strong></H2>
<P>n Agrarian economy food grains was very important. The power of notes and coins was not so dominant then. Sumptuous food, clothing enough to cover body, treasury filled with grains, barn filled with cattle was the sole purpose of our ancestors and today’s villagers believe money is strength and their purpose is to have cash in hand and cash in bank. They have learnt this from urbanites. Person who first created money a mesmerizing tool also needs to be credited with creation of all evil things of the civilization. The atrocities and clashes that have taken place because of this person has not been caused by no other individual. In agrarian based economy such kind of destruction is not possible as grains cannot be hoarded for a longtime as it will get rotten and no one can hoard large quantities escaping notice of others. One has to utilize the food grains in one form or the other. But, when currency rules the economy, one has the ability to reserve the wealth in whatever form and wherever possible in most secretive manner. Materialistic comforts and luxury which cannot be purchased through grains can be easily obtained by money. This creates a greed for money and desire to acquire wealth by whatever means. Government officers, Lawyers, Professors, Businessman and every other class of people have all chosen this path. So, how long can our friends living in villages be free of such thoughts and action? </P>
<P>For creation of wealth, people living in cities choose different means and employ various methods which are not easily visible. People living in villages employ other methods which are little crude and noticeable. Deceit groups, rivalry, disputes, corruption, pomp and show are present in wealthy societies but well disguised in the aristocratic fashion. But in rural areas they come across as presented badly. The root of all human beings is one and therefore sanctification as to happen not only in rural parts of country but also to elite class of the urban society. Truth, Honesty, fear of conscience and righteousness are fundamental for development. Until we toil hard and grow these fundamentals it is unlikely for us to see progress in our society, Europe serves as evidence to fact wealth created on immoral grounds deceives peace of mind. </P>

<H2><strong>Our Devotion </strong></H2>
<P>ndians are natural devotees is a hackneyed opinion and we need to test this. </P>
<P>In our devotion what percentage constitutes Love and what percentage Fear? Love and Fear are two distinct and dissimilar things. Majority of peoples’ devotions is only Fear. For many of them temple is a shop or a business place; is a transaction with God. “Oh! God if you beget me a child, I will give you a silver cradle”; “If you help me get a pay rise, I will perform special prayers”; “ If you help my business prosper, I will render special offerings”; or “ God ! If you keep my secret intact I will hold a car festival”; “If you make my neighbor lose his pride I will serve you” – this tit for tat, eye for an eye kind of devotion is what most people have. If one God does not yield to their terms and conditions they move on to a different God, whoever favors their transaction. The inner heart lacks pure love; it is born out of fear. It is only to appease God in fear that something evil or bad might occur disrupting our daily routines and activities. </P>
<P>True devotion is unconditional and does not anticipate anything in return. Does mother expect anything in return from her child? Just as the Mother’s face beams with joy and contentment on seeing her child’s face, as the bird takes its flight with happiness at the dawn, as we get immersed and get lost on listening to good music, as our mind glows at the sight of a marvelous beauty; so is the devotion when mind meditates on God uninterrupted with other thoughts to experiences happiness. Such devotion is neither easy nor easily attainable. It is a result of rigorous and lengthy practice. It requires true detachment, wisdom and practice of righteousness. It constrains thoughts of personal comfort. It encourages thinking about miracles created by God in this ecosystem and how to fit and live in this ecosystem. </P>
<P>To fit and gel in this ecosystem is itself blossoming of soul. That is the secret of custom. Home, Family, Society, State and so on are all arrangements for the practice of such a custom. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H2><strong>Path for Blossoming of Soul </strong></H2>
<P>e have already looked at the summary of preaching of Upanishads and Bhagvad Gita. The purpose and goal of all those are: </P>
<P>“Any human being who considers all living things as embedded in him and acts indiscriminately and who sees the same spirit that is inside him to be in all living beings and becomes a partner in their experiences is free of sorrow and sin.” </P>
<P>All troubles and issues arise when one has a differentiative treatment towards his fellow beings. A person who experiences oneness among all living beings will not have enemies. </P>
<P>Such an encompassing and inclusive thought can be well appreciated but difficult to bring into practice. Such a daunting uphill task has to be scaled step by step which means it is attainable and can be fully realized only through daily observance. In that observance our mind, intellect and ears will have to synergize for blossoming of the higher and most sensitive, soul strength. That which human beings keep addressing as “I, Myself” is the soul. </P>
<P>If we stand by side of a pond and throw a stone to the center of pond, ripples are created at center which circumferentially traverses to the pond. Our soul also has to gradually expand in a wave form and cover the entire universe. That is blossoming of soul. </P>
<P>We can assume the waves to be prominently six in number and they are: </P>

<P>5) India as a Country – Our expansion of mind should not stop at the state level but has to reach the entire nation. This is our birth country, irrespective of the state, city, language, religion, caste, creed; we are first citizens of the country and then the smaller classifications such as Hindu, Kannadiga etc. In the holy river of Indian all our differences have to get washed away. This is the Fifth Wave. </P>
<P>6) Human race – Our love towards our country needs to further expand and flow to cover the entire human race. Ignoring the development of others, India’s development cannot take place and without development of India there cannot be progress for any other state or region. Without development of State there cannot be welfare of city, society or family. If we segregate and observe, a human’s life which appears miniscule and the gigantic human society has an orderly relationship like a chain. Let alone the human kingdom, all living beings should enter our ecosystem. That is compassion, repentance, kindness. That is feeling of being part of universe and that is the mark of supremely intelligent. </P>
<P>In view of this, our ancestors said “Udaracharithananthu Vasudaiva Kutambakam” meaning for People with larger purpose in life and higher conduct the entire world is their family which is the sixth wave. </P>
<P>Our soul has to blossom like a flower with seven petals. That is true expansion of one’s life form or growth of soul. But the fact is in us most of the times the attachment and affection does not cross the boundary of our household. First our family and then the relatives will be the limit to which our thinking about society can extend. Our selfishness does not melt and flow beyond this. Our expansion of soul and inclusive attitude freezes at our door step. What is the use of our Vedanta being of highest order? We have confined our lives to self pity and compassion. Let alone our thinking about the entire world, we don’t even think about our city, state or country. </P>
<P>We have explored and found various reasons and causes for India to come under foreign rule. Another important reason for this is our narrow mindedness. We lack the practice of thinking about welfare of society; it appears that we undertake any social responsibility tasks (such as building shelter for underprivileged, hospitals, planting trees) more in anticipation of obtaining safe place in heaven or obtain a clean image in society rather than born out of self drive to do something better for the ecosystem we live in. People who do not get adequate respect and status in this world do not get mind to attempt to do anything for others. Our ancestors discarded the thinking about this world as something mean. Naturally thoughts about our city or village, state, nation all vanished from our minds. “Thinking about the city, wealthy person became poor” with this opinion our people lost the national pride. This led to downfall of our society. We left the concern about the village to the village head; state to the rulers or government of state. To the extent the Village head or rulers of state were efficient citizens obtained well being. If the governors of villages and state were useless and inappropriate the citizen’s welfare worsened. Our ancestors did not define rules and principles for governors of state to appropriately deliver their responsibilities. They believed more on the ruler’s self commitment to righteousness. They did not see any reason for not keeping faith in their governors. But in our era there is higher and urgent need to have a good governing system to monitor the functioning of our Heads of State or Nation. Democracy has been a great tool and weapon which we are gifted to voice our opinion and elect an able and efficient leadership but it is our important duty to exercise this collectively with right intellect. </P>

<H2><strong>Harmony – Balanced Approach </strong></H2>
<P>n our time the expansion in terms of geography is very much reduced. Distance between cities and states are getting bridged in all possible ways. Travel to places which was taking several months and days has been possible today in few days and few hours respectively. Communication has revolutionized our lives where we can get in touch and be in real-time contact across time horizons and geographies with people. We are virtually getting to be one single world with entire community networked. In Sunday Market of Tippedoddi village of Mulbagal Taluk, you can find clothes from England, knives from Germany, American automobiles, Australian Cotton, crackers from Japan, toys from China. As every city and village is getting globalized is it right for us to forget the huts and houses present here? We cannot forget nor neglect any strata of society in this development process. </P>
<P>We already have identified six strata of our society. In this context we need to always remember one principle. Smaller ones should not be obstacles for the larger ones; larger ones should not suppress the smaller ones. In our concern for our household we should not forget our city; for welfare of society we cannot split families. It would be similar to ill treating your wife in fear of your mother or expelling your mother based on complaint of your wife. For the benefit of caste and religion Nation cannot be subjected to loss and destruction. If the caste and region is getting destroyed we </P>
<SECTION>
<H5><strong>Harmony – Balanced Approach </strong></H5>
<P>need not be silent on the pretext of Nation. There is no benefit in creating enemies for sake of nation and cannot allow our country to suffer in our admiration of Unified world. </P>
<P>The challenge of righteousness or dharma that is facing us is how to stratify our Love and devotion to each of the six strata discussed above. In our pursuit to reach zenith of our life; we cannot ignore any of the six steps as irrelevant; we cannot stop and stagnate at any stage. To orderly organize all of these is rightful thinking. This is called balanced approach or harmony. </P>
<P>Our food becomes nutritious only when various tastes and ingredients are included. Salt opposes sourness, spicy chilly is opposing to jaggery but all this put together turn out into a delicious dish. Cooking is a process of transforming all these substances to a state of co-existence and is nothing but harmony of tastes. In all our worldly transactions it is essential to have such wisely harmony. </P>
<P>To achieve this harmony it requires principle sensitive knowledge and that is true learning. There are many things that we want in this world. In that, what is the cost of each of them? Which is more important to us? What is of top priority? - A balanced judgment has to be exercised and this knowledge is of supreme value to us. We already have seen different faculties of science and what we need to exercise on top of these is this balanced approach. </P>

<H2><strong>Purification of Soul </strong></H2>
<P>uch a discretionary judgment occurs because of worldly experience or from examination of history. That is Purification (Samskara) or civilization. The objective of civilization is twofold a) set free the feelings of the heart and spread it widely b) to highlight the discriminations in the value of various material objects. The tools available for such a refinement in life are mainly five: </P>
<P>i) Family – It is the heat that softens the selfish and self centered attitude of I (Me). It uses the heat of pride of being associated to Parents, Siblings, Spouse and Children to melt the entanglements of the mind, seal the cracks, strengthen the bonds, make us cry, laugh, think, perspire, relax and ripe. Therefore family is considered one among the three afflictions arising from deity or fate. House becomes the first school of discipline. </P>
<P>ii) Occupation – This places us in a position which is distant from our known ones and subjects us to various challenges. Our inner strength nurtures and grows because of the exercise at this place. This second school of discipline fosters the enrichment of experience and improves brilliance of our nature. </P>
<P>A person, who aspires to live well, will first identify a job or occupation, learn it, believe it that alone will help him to live and will try to excel in that. This excellence arises not because of his position in society or his education but the manner in which he performs in that job. The designation or status of job is irrelevant, what are more important is the intelligence, devotion and capability towards the neat execution of the job. </P>
<P>In Mahabharata, Yudhishtira (Dharmaraya) was questioned by the demigod (Yaksha): “Where is the dwelling place of righteousness (dharma)?”. Yudhishtira responded saying <em>“DaakshamekaPadam Dharmam”</em> (In the work we do we need to exhibit capability, wisdom and skill, that is the dwelling place of righteousness.) We have seen lack of such serious commitment to work and more of eye washing attitude. Nature performs her duties irrespective of being supervised or observed by any one. Beautiful flowers blossom in completely uninhabited forests not in anticipation of any appreciation but because it is its nature. Likewise if we take up the job that we have obtained and do it with all the required commitment and intelligence, our own reputation will grow. </P>
<P>iii)Literary Arts – This is my biggest school. If our life has to be appropriate with respect to family, occupation and other fields, education about literary arts is very much needed. There are three sections in this: </P>
<dl>
<DT>a. </DT>
<DD>Literature – This includes Poetry, Prose, Drama, essays, stories, discourses and various such works. It brings out the numerous emotions of joy, sorrow, anger, despair which is hidden deep inside our mind and allows it to empathize with others experiences and gel with them. It further presents to us various beauties and variations in life and compels us to analyze about them. There are different levels of beauty and Literature instigates us to differentiate among them. </DD>
<DT>b. </DT>
<DD>History – Throughout the world how people lived; what hardships they faced; in times of misery and prosperity how their minds functioned; how people reacted to words of wisdom; how it gets catalyzed to provocative talks; how great men influence behavior of others; overall how </DD>
</dl>
<P>people are subjected to fate; what proportion of life is achieved through human efforts – it showcases all these and aids us in our evaluation through wisdom. </P>
<P>c. Performing Arts – This includes Music, Painting, Sculpture, Dance, Movies and other such things which make us emote. This aids Literature. They act on our hearts and bring to our experience all those emotions which are part of human nature. It helps us to develop empathy in our life. </P>
<P>iv)Religion – This is in position of supreme teacher for everyone. It is our faith towards God and conduct that is appropriate to it. There are none who do not align to this concept. It exists even with individuals who dwell in forests. The concept of heaven and hell resides on this premise. Generally our conduct is due to fear of God. In this way it influences the thinking of sin and good deed, thereby rectifying various practices of religion and society. In world history the influence of religion is immeasurable, in sum total this is something that we can’t ignore, neither it is necessary for us to ignore it. Supreme devotion is as pure as the love of young child; it is unconditional; full with happiness; it involves commitment to one’s religion and no animosity to other religions; having an attitude that the truth we realize may be realized by others in different form. Thirdly religion as to inculcate the mindset that we are all children of same God and need to live like brothers. One of the devotee has expressed : </P>
<P><em>Maatha cha parvathi devi pitha devo maheshwarha Baandhavo shiva bhakthanam swadesham bhuvanathrayam. </em></P>
<P>(My mother is Goddess Parvathi and Father is Lord Shiva, all my relatives are devotees of Shiva and all three worlds are my world.) Which means compassion, service to community, charity are all live forms of righteousness. </P>
<P>Does this mean we do not require temples, prayers, idols, photos, meditation, chanting? All these need to be there as they help constantly remind and strengthen our beliefs. Through prayers and meditation the mind acquires tranquility and purity. Therefore all of us can observe and practice that suits our mental setup as it is good. Along with that we also need to take the broad mindedness and accommodative qualities of our religion to develop worldly brotherhood. </P>

If India committed fallacy of forgetting science thinking about spirituality, Europe committed the blunder of forgetting spirituality dwelling in science. Therefore, Europeans believed materialistic things and pleasure superior to spirituality and ventured into wars more often. If peace has to prevail in the entire world and give up the fear of terror, devotion to science has to be evaluated with spiritual wisdom. </P>

<H2><strong>New Pot with Old Clay </strong></H2>
<P> have mentioned before that empire of science is not without limitations. Science can capture all those which can come to experience of our senses. Metaphysical objects and their actions can be explained to an extent by Physics and Biology. The supreme energy that is behind Physics is completely unexplainable by science. For this reason we need to bear in our mind that there certain things which is beyond the boundary of science. This is because looking at the scientific inventions and discoveries, Scientists can over stretch themselves to believe that nothing is farfetched for it. Last few years the advancement of Science and Technology has been profound, the nuclear advancements, travel to moon and exploration of other planetary objects, information technology explosion and so on. This is going to continue further but one basic tenet has to be remembered that science is part of world nature and is not beyond nature, it is in fact child of it. We have been able to create all these miracles from the raw material and principles made available by nature; clay is the same the pot that is being molded is new; hands of the potter is still the same the wheel that is available to make pots is different. Science has not created any new sense or any new organ. Even if succeed to develop something new the basis of that still will be of the same clay. What comes to light from this is that Science is an effort to bring out all the hidden capabilities of ancient nature; but will not create new nature itself. Scientists unlike Supreme saint Vishwamithra have not taken a path to create a new form which did not exist earlier. Even Vishwamithra attempted to create a clone of four faced Brahma which is an act of copying but not originality. As the limitations of Science are of this nature, it is not wise to lose our intellect to newer scientific thoughts and discard the everlasting spiritual knowledge. There is no conflict between Science and Spirituality. There is no need for a Spiritual practitioner to accuse Science. Life looks complete and gets beautified when one blends Science and Spirituality; Science at level of transactions and Spirituality at level of thinking. </P>

<H2><strong>Beware of Westernisation </strong></H2>
<P>or many years now we have been influenced and attracted by the show off of the western society, there mannerisms, their dress sense, etiquette and food habits. That glittering make-up is giving way to fading faces. Behind the rosy lips there are unbrushed teeth; inside the perfume filled clothes are those bodies which have not seen water for a long time. Intoxicating food, deadly weapons are the wonders of science. Kill, Eat, Loot is becoming the mantra of many nations. If we scrape the civilization make-up we are seeing the behavior similar to that of wild animals. Civilized Face, Devil’s mind appears to be the progress of western world. </P>
<P>This no way suggests that the western civilization is filled with wrong things and no reason for us to consider all of them as evil. There are many courageous and brave accomplishments in them. In current Indian Society there are hundreds of practices and acts which are demeaning and derogatory. Our job is to carefully examine the both the societies, select and adopt best of them. In the acts of humans whether they belong to eastern or western world there are many weakness and lacuna natural to their character. Therefore there is no sect or society which can be supremely idealized. Every human creation is bound to be subjected to independent examination and research. That independent wisdom is our duty. </P>
<P>Spiritual world is not visibly present, does not give scope for anyone to argue that it is untrue. The power of our senses is limited is a fact known to everyone. Eyes cannot smell; ears cannot see forms; nose cannot hear sounds. Every sense organ has different capabilities. Those which are not accessible to eyes are accessible to nose, that which appears false to nose is confirmed as truth by ears; things which are said to be unseen by ears are seen by eyes. Something that is not identified by one sensory organ can easily identified by other. The field of influence of any sense organ is limited. Eye power of every individual is different if one has the capability to spot something that is there few inches away and some can spot few feet away. But no human eye can spot that is miles away. Same is the case with one’s ears. If one kind of music can bring out happiness and pleasure for certain group of people, the same can be boring and not so pleasant to others but no one can hear the naturally s produced sound few miles away. Therefore what can be true for sense organ can be totally false for other. All of us have different tastes and preferences, if one likes sweet; it might be completely distasteful to others. As we observe that the capabilities of every sense organ is distinct and limited; one cannot refute the claim that there could be things which are beyond the capabilities of these sense organs. For this reason, our ancestors believed that soul is something that is beyond our cognition and cannot be subjected to our examination and held Vedas as the supreme evidence. The great saints who had insights far deeper than our sense organs and Vedas formed their gospel of experience. </P>

<H2><strong>Social Service </strong></H2>
<P>orm of God and Soul will become evident only through experience. This experience is attained only through inner sight and this is achievable only through blend of Mind and wisdom. Light emerging out of Wisdom and emotions of heart together give rise to a new light. Wisdom can be obtained through studies of various subjects but light that as to emerge out of heart has to come through interactions with society and not through self study. One should practice sympathy for difficulties of world. He has to participate in sharing the burden of the society. In process of working towards it he has to decrease his narrow mindedness and expand boundary of his soul. Only contact of society will enable him to purify his soul which is responsible for inner sight. </P>
<P>It is easy to sing “God is our Father; we are all one”. If we are to realize the true meaning of that in our lives; we need to engage ourselves in some social activity which does not involve yielding to petty favor requests of friends and relatives and our selfish acts. For this activity, we should not hold ourselves back until someone invites us but we have to voluntarily search for opportunities to engage. This is the path for expansion of our soul and easing us out of smaller troubles which could entrap us. </P>
<P>In our country there are two major avenues to engage in public activity namely i) Political, ii) Societal. </P>
<P>i) Politics involves thousands of things which are to be performed for good of the country which means subject related to welfare of our co-citizens. In this regard every alert human being has certain responsibilities which are the duties of citizen. The duties of citizen are mainly two fold: I) to abide by the law and order of the state ii) to continuously examine, review and express the opinion regarding function of the government. Honest conformity and Independent review are two major parts of duty of citizen. </P>
<P>Many people conform to law and order of the state but this is result of long practice not born out of intellect. This is a blind conformation but not arising out of independent thinking. Our conformity should emerge out of our wisdom. If we thoroughly comprehend the framework and rules of constitution and if we follow them with appropriate knowledge about it then it becomes useful. </P>
<P>We are still far behind in the action part of Political review. Review does not mean voice of anger or frustration. It needs support of knowledge and should not be biased or arising out of jealousy or animosity. In today’s cultured states rules and regulations are framed by citizen representatives. Selection of the citizen representative and supervising his actions are satisfactory is very important. It is a huge responsibility to elect the most capable and appropriate to Gram Panchayat, Municipality, State government and various other governing bodies. For this we need to have deep sense of understanding and unbiased view. It is duty of every citizen to earn such an understanding and impartial thinking. In this subject we are not in a position to state that our present customs and practices are fine. </P>
<P>After the election, there is no hold and supervision by the people on their representatives in the government. To observe the conduct of our political leaders, review and analyze their criticism and arguments in media and provide valuable suggestions are the main aspects of citizenship. If this is not properly executed people’s say in the government will get weakened and democracy will exist for namesake without the true force that can help the nation. Therefore it is important for every citizen to pay appropriate and cautious attention towards politics. </P>
<P>ii) Even in the social sphere there is lot of work to be done. Every village or town has one or two social bodies like the Municipality, temples, libraries, discourse centers, gymnasium, and welfare societies for improving education, health, theatre groups and such other social organizations. To become active member of such groups or form such initiatives is every individual’s duty. This leads to betterment of townships and the individual’s life gets broadened. In this process he will mingle well with the society, comprehend various individual mannerisms, mould his behavior to the society, constantly rectify oneself and expanding his mind on his own will allow his soul to grow. Social service is the daily duty related to national welfare and is the best school for education to allow growth of heart. The inspiration that is present there to research on one’s soul and opportunity to expand it is nowhere else available. The new form of electorate that needs to happen in India is through the practice of social service. </P>

<H2><strong>Improvement of Villages – Land Cultivation </strong></H2>
<P>e have already seen how villages are getting destroyed. Villages are becoming weaker due to attraction of urban cities. With the new age politics the village strength is being broken, in lure of the salaries and other comforts people from villages are moving to workplaces in factories or offices. In context of election, for sake of competing more crime is becoming rampant. There is scant attention towards the agricultural land. We are importing several essential food commodities from other countries. Is it required to fill politics to such an extent? Is it good for the people? Is it difficult to control the commotion during the election? All these are the prime questions. If we assume that there is certain amount of politics required, we need mechanisms to counter the ill effects of it. Agricultural practice is a profession which teaches people unity. Without friendship and co-operation it is hard to cultivate the land even for a day. Tilling, ploughing, cultivating, harvesting, cleaning, chafing, transporting all of them require man power. Cultivation is not a single person activity. It requires various farm equipment and other paraphernalia which needs to be available at right time. Even the cattle that are required at times required. In this way cultivation is a co-operative effort of many houses and that is the beauty of it. Therefore it develops humanity. High amount of automation and technology erodes this human bonding. Politics and elections only destroy the human relationships. We are trying to emulate cultures and practices of various other nations and attain peace of mind that needs to be curtailed. For this to be </P>
<P>possible the task that needs to be accomplished by the educated class is big. People who are pensioners or who have taken voluntary retirement from services and who still have the capability to work need to take this up as their responsibility. Even in them, people who have lands that can be cultivated need to make up their minds to stay in villages and through their good conduct will have to transform the minds of the village citizens. One large co-operative movement, one festival and one social center can erode the philistine thinking of several individuals and lift their minds to a higher altitude.(In this regard it is very appropriate to remind ourselves of the Operation Flood started by Mr. Kurien which transformed life of several milk farmers). Every village or town has a place of worship. This can easily be made as center of activity to organize discourses, discussions on scriptures, village festivals and elate the beauty of them. This can easily kill the boredom of villages. The rampant transformation we have seen in the infrastructure related to transportation and communication further enables to provide any facility and entertainment that is available in urban cities to villages. This has to be enabled by the educated class first with the help of the government taking it up as a joint responsibility. The essential service that needs to be rendered to the nation today is the upliftment of villages. Upliftment here refers to number of people residing in villages, their health, physical strength, clean and tidy environment of their households, growth of their livestock, rejuvenation and development of lakes and ponds, primary education, medical facilities and above all this to control the migration of population from villages to urban cities. People who are physically and intellectually strong should stay in their respective villages and put their strength to use for the development. In order to enable this we need to adequately fill motivational factors in villages. A good society is the only medicine to bad politics. Welfare and Development of villages has to become a primary goal in Social service. </P>

<H2><strong>Debt to Nation </strong></H2>
<P>ne of the common difference between us and citizens of the western world (referred to as England in the original book) is with reference to the constant recollection of our debt to nation. A citizen in the West fully acknowledges the privileges and support rendered to him by government and is cognizant that he has to receive more and in-return he has certain duties that he needs to perform is something that always stays in his memory. In our case the fact that we need to bear in mind that we are indebted to nation is itself something that is not well received by us. Our righteousness and duty does not cross the boundary of our house. We need to earn well; need to leave property for our wife and children and need to be comfortable in our houses is our thought process. Our visit to temples and holy places is also to ensure that we bring welfare and wealth to our family. The thought of nation very rarely occurs to our mind. This is narrow minded thinking of our righteousness. Duty and responsibility towards family is big and of foremost importance. But that in itself is not the complete form of our righteousness and duty. A person who does not contribute or work for welfare of co-citizen is as good as being a defaulter of duty or righteousness. </P>
<P>A person who is bound to duty and has devotion to upliftment of soul needs to get involved in some form of social service. Pride of our duty has to flow beyond our house. Walls of our house should not become imprison our life. Our commitment to serve for one of the selfless cause will help us achieve the right fulfillment and true meaning for our life. </P>
<P>Like this the path to improve our souls is many fold. This is also the path to improve our nation. Our holy scriptures (Vedas) which advice us on the path of philosophy and our path to create comfortable and dignified life for the entire society are not mutually opposing. They are in fact two edges of the same road. </P>

<H2><strong>Service to Society – Education of Soul </strong></H2>
<P>n the above said five disciplines of purification of soul, three of them are something we commonly practice: i) Family ii) Livelihood or Employment iii) Following of Religion. These three things have come commonly from ancient time. If not through wisdom but with blind faith they have been observed. The other two things that are not in practice are: i) Study of Literature or Review of Works ii) Service to Society. </P>
<P>As the level of literacy is growing in recent times if not for earning wisdom or knowledge they are doing it for sake of getting entertained. </P>
<P>But, the service to society is highly neglected and has taken a back seat. This society is the important school of teaching morals. The purification and molding the soul receives in this is very enriching and is also essential for the progress of nation. It is also the foundation for democratic state. </P>

<H2><strong>Blend of Old and New </strong></H2>
<P>e have discussed about the progress above. What is the path for it? What are the tools and methods for it? – is difficult to analyze and comprehend. Presently in the world obstacles which were never seen earlier have taken birth. In the human history this has been period of transition. Even in that the obstacles that are posing human minds of Indians is not being posed to any other country. The reason for this is the dilemma of our ancient customs and rituals <em>vis a vis</em> western influence on our civilization. </P>
<P>In two centuries that preceded our independence, our lifestyle had been adulterated. In the many tools and machines that Europeans introduced to India, the magic wound by some of the materialistic luxuries had been very attractive. Their strategy and equipments of warfare helped them win over many Indian states. We lost our mind to their display of valor and strength. It cast a illusion in our minds that Western Civilization is much bigger and their lifestyle is of higher order. Their way of dressing, food and entertainment, their teaching methodologies, their mannerisms – all were falsely considered by us to be better than ours and we gave up our customs and practices. So do we have to really want to become like Westerners? Just look at them and their lifestyle – there is lot of unrest everywhere, houses have become transit lounges, marriages have become contracts, whatever we like has become dharma or righteousness, husband and wife, parents and children relationship are falling apart, enmity between nations; racial discrimination and various such differences. There is fear of war, anxiety about food for common man, jealousy and uncertainty cloud in many parts of western world. Can we call this as a good civilization? Is destruction of peace feature of civilization? </P>
<P>By asking these questions we are not suggesting everything in Western Civilization is bad. There are many noteworthy aspects of western progress. There are many things which strengthen and nourish human life that has been earned by westerners. In spite of these accomplishments there are many things which are beyond their reach is the point to be borne in our minds. </P>
<P>Such an open criticism is possible with respect to Indian culture as well. Whatever principles of life our ancestors have found for good life are proving to be insufficient. We can remove this insufficiency by drawing many points from western culture. Westerners need to learn from Indians and Indians need to learn from Westerners. Through this mutual learning process there could be betterment of human life. </P>
<P>One of the primary questions that is with respect to India is how to blend our ancient culture with that of the new culture of Western countries. How do we evolve a path that is favorable to our progressive path and at the same time does not make detached from our ancient history? It is not appropriate to blindly ape the Westerners without having an independent thinking of their practices. It is not a path which is of contentment and satisfaction is quite evident from their current state. At the same time it is unjust and inappropriate to completely give up the Western Culture as we all of have become part of one single globalized world. We have shredded the image and practices of brahminical attitude of staying aloof from rest of world. Those days are now behind us and will never return. Today’s world is a globalized market with connectivity across the world. We need to live with the other nations and we have identified that Western world has abundant source of valuable aspects for us. Their Science and Technology, their political and social strategies and more importantly their nature of independent thinking are some of them that needs to be absorbed by us. </P>
<P>But, how do we blend these new things with our old practices and customs? How do we ensure that the flow of Science and technology happens from the Western world without flow of their social practices? How do we ensure that their fascination to enjoy the materialistic things of life does not blind us from spiritual introspection? These are some of imposing questions that we face. The scope of this book is not to discuss those things and find answers for them. We are just highlighting the challenges in this process. </P>
<P>Primarily the social system of Western world is constructed on materialistic comforts. This does not mean that there have not been Saints and Sages in these places. Saints and Devotees equally exist there. But the political and economic system is strengthened because of consumerism and materialistic benefits they derive. </P>
<P>People like those are not rare in our society. India is a place of only saints is something that no one can claim. People here are increasingly getting attracted to such materialistic comforts but if we just study our ancient culture and practices we can clearly understand that our path is distinct than that of the westerners. In our society the foundation of the social order and practices is on the human value system. Soul is greater than physical body. Achieving solace of the soul is higher than the physical pleasures. Empathy is higher than affection. Donating is higher than Earning. Righteousness is higher than Power. Indian culture stands on such a discretionary balance. </P>
<P>For human life both body and soul are important but which is higher than the other? “Soul First, Body is secondary” says the Aryan system. “Whether soul exists or not, body is strong enough and therefore we need to look after it well” is the Western thinking. For those who believe “Soul is supreme and body is for sake of soul” their valuation of body is limited. For them how do you accept and align to their life, the system built around comforts to satisfy the body is the question. To efficiently determine this, it is required to have a independent thinking. </P>
<P>In the Western Culture usually every person as a independent thinking which is personal to him. For us individual’s life is specially connected to society. Western marriages are primarily concerned with two individuals who are tying the knot. Indian marriages are generally related to welfare of the two families they represent. Ours is a socialistic society where as the Westerners is a capitalist society laying emphasis more on individual comforts rather than family values. Thus, in the primary vision of architecting the social structure itself we are different and therefore it does reflect similar feelings in other societal practices. Industrial revolution was the root cause for growth of their society; agriculture formed the basis for growth of our society. As the Western countries lost their mind to accumulation of wealth through trade neglecting agriculture their situation became like hen which found gems while searching for food grains. Most of the countries have lost the capacity to grow food grains and heavily import them. We have to look at ways and means of industrializing the nation without losing our focus on agriculture. This has to be exercised with caution. So, if there are ten things that needs to be learnt and adopted from other parts of the world there are equal number of things which should not be adopted. </P>
<P>We are currently in age where different thought process, different faiths and different opinions are driving minds of people in innumerable directions leading them to a state of confusion and illusion. During these times people need to be sharp with wisdom. If we give ears to people who shout loud, then we will continue to remain in confused state. We should not be carried away by the mesmerizing campaigns of few interest groups but have independent review and thinking to find way of righteousness. </P>

<H2><strong>Larger Philosophy </strong></H2>
<P>f evil spirits are warded off, then it is possible to realize supreme soul. If inappropriate faith is removed from our lives then we will be able to gain wisdom of welfare. Therefore we need to first examine our individual minds and cleanse them. Baseless fears have to be discarded. Previous Karma (actions belonging to previous birth), luck, destiny and fate – such thoughts have to be distanced for a while, the world we live in is the evident destiny, human effort is the duty assigned to us by God, expansion of soul is the supreme victory – such thoughts should come to our remembrance. </P>
<P>In 4<SPAN><Sup>th</Sup></SPAN> Century BC, when Greek society was indulged in excessive practices of spirit, curse and occult science, Greek philosopher Diogenes erected a scripture at a place visible to entire society which read as follows: </P>
<P>“Don’t fear God, don’t worry about death; what’s good is easy to get, and what’s terrible is easy to endure”. </P>
<P>This should serve as medicine to cure different ailments that humans are afflicted with. </P>
<P>When we talk about heroism and human effort a word of caution needs to be said pressingly. From human effort this world will become a permanent heaven is something not suggested by anyone. There are many things that are improbable to solve through our intellect and science. Lust, anger, jealousy and attachment can be removed from human character is a farfetched thought. When they spring up in our minds, to subdue them in such a fashion that they do not outgrow their limits is possible only through moral science or political system but cannot be completely uprooted from humans. Because in reality the seeds of such thoughts are embedded by nature. In the same manner diseases, old age and death cannot be completely removed through science. All of them have a definite place in the order of creation. In the man’s quest and search of nature, nature constantly conspires for his destruction. The fate of human world is something that cannot be newly written by anyone. On our slate there have been many writings of chalk and coal. Some of them can be removed while some of them continue to stay in a hidden fashion as dents on slate. Our present situation is unlike this but a manifestation of thousands of years of our history. Therefore the changes that we conceive and wish to make to some our old practices is not happening at the rate which we desire. Our vision is progress but that is something that cannot be achieved in hurry. Progress has to be steady and long sustaining one and therefore has to start from educational system and orderly progress to encompass all walks of life. Progress achieved through patience, independent thinking, valuation of pros and cons, humility and appropriate examination will be a successful one. </P>

<H2><strong>Patience – Order </strong></H2>
<P>oday’s world is fast and on-demand mode. The moment it realizes and conceives something to be good it insists to have it on immediate basis. If they are not able to achieve that goal then their immediate reaction is: revolt; revolt is often unkindly, mob behavior and violent. To disrupt the existing order or system even before thinking of constructing new one is not the right thing to do. We start holding rich responsible for all the poverty and clean homes for all the untidy ones. These things are easier to do and make them like culprits for our situations. People who became rich were at some point poor and people fail to examine the reasons and their actions that made them wealthy. No one has the patience to perform root cause analysis of their situations and identify the underlying factors which shape up their lives. This also does not mean that everyone who is wealthy has accumulated it in the most just manner but it advocates examining the governing and political boundary of accumulating wealth. Any change in system should not be a knee jerk reaction due to frustration. </P>
<P>Society is a outcome of a long historic review; it differs from one nation to another based on the situations they have been through; in-depth research of human behavior; evaluation of explicit and implicit values. Any change that is affected without bearing these things in mind is like medical treatment becoming more horrifying than the disease itself. Human Society is an ancient building. Any attempt to rebuild and remodel has to be done with utmost caution or else in our effort to patch up one side of the wall we will bring down the other. </P>
<P>Any change or reform in our conduct occurs due to a new opinion. This happens only when the new opinion or feeling sinks into the mind of that individual and blends into their natural mannerisms and not otherwise. As the seed that is sown in the ground takes time to get nourished and grow into a tress so does a new opinion or thinking will take time to get deep rooted into individuals to become a part of their natural conduct. Therefore it is unjust to expect and believe than any new thought that we propose to others will be taken immediately and acted upon. When the sanctity of our thought gets proved and registered in their minds they will naturally acknowledge. </P>

<H2><strong>Progress – A Lengthy Act </strong></H2>
<P>rogress is not a one day’s act in a lifetime. It should be act of every moment and every day. There is no good thing in our lives which can be achieved in one single day and which can be enjoyed throughout our lives. Hygiene, Health, Wealth, Friendship, love of relatives – for all of them we need to work on a daily basis. After several hours of taking bath we need to cleanse our body again, after few hours of taking food we need to feed ourselves, after certain period of getting salary we need to again attain it and so is progress. If we stop thinking of our progress we decline (Stagnation eventually leads to death) and it is man’s fate. Continuous efforts and refinement of our lives is daily duty. </P>
<P>A scheme in hands of human being is just like a garland in the hands of monkey, no matter how good a state’s system and financial progress is planned, some feature of human conduct poisons it. As we aim to shoot at fruit hanging from tree it no way guarantees that our throw will strike the fruit and bring it down. With whatever wisdom and caution we try to conduct ourselves in executing our duties there is bound to be some short coming in the end result. This is the principle of progress. Even the best automobile will have its parts worn out as they are continuously used. Space objects like Planets also slow down after sometime due to continuous revolution and rotation due to loss of energy. Likewise, our social system, practice, principles and laws become redundant and outdated after certain time which no one can prevent. Therefore, all of us need to be ever prepared to face and bear challenges to a certain extent. As is our duty to surmount the challenges with enthusiastic effort so is our duty to patiently and bravely endure it. Patience and Human effort are not two different situations but they need to blend into one. Patience does not mean inaction and effort does not mean fight with fit of rage. Patience is to have balanced and calm mind without tumultuous emotions of anger; constantly disallowing the mind to be lethargic and inactive with thoughts of progress and engaging outwardly in rightful action is effort. In this way human effort is a kind of education of soul. </P>

<H2><strong>Our Life is Peepal Tree </strong></H2>
<P>ur ancestors have always compared our life to Peepal tree. Peepal tree lives for a fairly long time. In spite of leaving for hundreds of years it does not appear to be the same today as it was yesterday. A branch which appears fresh and filled with life will appear weak and dry after few weeks. A branch which appears worn and weeding out now is sprouting with new leaves in the very next week. Our human life is also similar with progressive intellect, wisdom, development, enthusiasm on one side and on other side we have wagered mind, effort in vain and complete lack of enthusiasm. There is no space anywhere for complete greed or despair. Rising, falling, rolling, spreading somehow the river of life goes on at all times. Why should we fear and loose heart? For sake of education and enrichment of soul we need to aim and achieve progress. In that we should not have greed, ill temper, and unnecessary excitement for fruits of our efforts and at the same time it is not good to have laziness, lack of human effort. Our activity should continue uninterrupted like act of nature, celestial activities and sprouts of plants. </P>
<P><SPAN>If God exists or not is not really relevant. Our life is the primary evidence for us. Our life is remembrance of God. In this way it is appropriate we respect our life as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of God’s activity. Life is gift by God; beautifying Life is our gratitude to God. Life’s progress, refinement and glorification are not only </SPAN><SPAN>aspiration of people who are indulged in comfort and luxury but also the message of Vedas and Upanishads. Our great sage Vidyaranya who simultaneously overlooked responsibility of being the chief mentor to Vijayanagar Empire and Head pontiff of the prestigious, illustrious Sringeri Shankar Mutt said in Panchadashi <em>“jnAninA charitum shakyam samyak rAjyAdi loukikam”</em> which means it is very well possible for the Jnani (enlightened) to engage in empirical duties such as administering a Kingdom. There is no opposition to worldly activities and Vedic philosophies, practice of Upanishads and Vedas is best employed for selfless service to betterment of society is evident from life of Vidyaranya. </SPAN></P>

<H2><strong>Belief for Life </strong></H2>
<P>ife’s enthusiasm, human effort, universal friendliness – progress, science, and humility are the three mantras for life. The classical example for this is well represented by our great poet in form of Hanuman in epic Ramayana. Hanuman aptly symbolizes devotion without selfishness, undaunted human effort and dedication filled with enthusiasm. Let this Hanuman be the Guru and guiding light for all Indians. </P>
<P>Look at Hanuman – Teacher of Courage </P>
<P>Pray for his strength and bravery, </P>

<H3><strong>Caution required with respect to Science </strong></H3>
<P>cience has progressed well and conquered new frontiers unveiling many new secrets of nature but we still have many unanswered questions with reference to life. Human life’s questions are more introspective in nature where as the feats of science are external. We are no way close to use science to answer them. </P>
<P>Every discipline of science is still incomplete in reaching the complete potential. Physics which is considered as king among all sciences is still exploring the various constituents of atom and its structure. Advancement in life sciences is just breaking grounds and making a paradigm shift. Psychology is yet to establish one strong foundation for answering majority of questions. </P>
<P>How did life originate from the inanimate substances such as earth, water and air? How did mind originate? These two questions are still answered. </P>
<P>The reach of these sciences currently is like you have a well which is having water 60 feet deep from surface and rope which is 60 feet in length. Rope can only help you to touch the surface of water but it is not enough to fetch you to water going inside. It is just sufficient to touch exteriors of our life. Power, Telecommunications, Health sciences and Information Technology all have influenced and changed our external lives but not have impacted our internal life. </P>
<P>The state of science is still half baked, half ripe and many of the principles are there to change and we cannot extrapolate them to every walk of life. There are various principles and customs which have helped to build the social structure of this country. On one hand we have to use science to remove from root some of the social practices which have been evils such as child marriage, female infanticide, blind faith and superstitions but we also have to be extremely cautious not to use them against institutions such as marriage which is a healthier way of social living. Politics on the other hand should not take advantage of these scientific advancements for driving personal agenda and goals. Change is very important for all our lives but change has to be accompanied with proper scientific reasoning. </P>

<H3><strong>Takeaway Note : </strong></H3>
<P>It was irrerestible for me to complete my humble attempt of this translation work without this takeaway note which is a brilliant message of Swami Vivekananda, one of the prolific thinker of 20<SPAN><Sup>th </Sup></SPAN>Century which India was blessed with. These words serve as icing on the cake and encapsulates the message of this book: </P>
<P>“The history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves. That faith calls out the divinity within. You can do anything. You fail only when you do not strive sufficiently to manifest infinite power. </P>
<P>Anything that makes you weak physically, intellectually, and spiritually; reject as poison; there is no life in it, it cannot be true. Truth is strenthening, truth is purity, truth is all-knowledge; truth must be enlightening and must be invigorating. </P>
<P>Let us all work hard, my brethren; this is no time for sleep. On our work depends the coming of the India of the future…” </P>
