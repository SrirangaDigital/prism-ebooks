<P>Introduction and Acknowledgement</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Almost two years back, I began to write a series of weekly articles for young readers of the Deccan Herald, about the energy crisis that we are confronted with. After briefly describing the five major elements of nature <em>KSHITI </em><em>(earth), A</em><em>P</em><em>(water), </em><em>TEJ </em><em>(Energy), </em><em>MORUT</em><em>(wind), </em><em>BYOM</em><em>(sky), </em>as conceived in ancient India and other early civilizations, I moved on to human quest of energy, one of the five elements stated above. This book is based on the articles modified as necessary.</P>
<P>My main objective has been to make the young readers aware of the Energy problems that we have been facing now, the gross inequity of energy distribution and consumption and what we need to do in order to avoid a serious crisis in future, with particular emphasis on India’s problems. Some elementary concepts have been introduced for the uninitiated.</P>
<P>I remind myself as I tell the young readers that we are extremely fortunate to be born as humans on this privileged planet where everything has been right so that life could thrive. A visit to a cave reveals how the discovery of light changed the lives of the cavemen and how their creative instincts emerged and the modern man was born. Having briefly described the formation of fossil fuels where solar energy has been stored for millions of years, I go on to describe how, following the Industrial revolutions, we have been literally plundering this planet of ours during the last two centuries and are nearing a state of bankruptcy. </P>
<P>Some of the inventions, their principles and also the lives of the great inventors have been briefly described. From the early stage of using steam to relieve human drudgery one inevitably goes on to the second industrial revolution with the invention of current electricity, the life blood of modern age.</P>
<P>Our craze for speed and craving for comfort have led to new inventions, exacerbated the energy problem and worsened atmospheric pollution. </P>
<P>Towards the end, the use of uncontrolled nuclear power for bombs and controlled nuclear power for producing electricity have been touched upon. With apprehensions expressed about the safety of use of nuclear reactors based on fission and the uncertainty about fusion based nuclear power generation, even at a distant future, I focus on Alternative energy that is increasingly becoming viable.</P>
<P>Energy saving and conservation are also emphasized, described as sources of alternative energy.</P>
<P>Particular emphasis is laid on solar photovoltaic and wind energy with the reminder that despite the development of alternative energy the use of conventional, non-renewable energy production, such as coal based energy, will be indispensable for a fairly long time.</P>
<P>That a peaceful international ambience will bring about substantial energy saving and ensure human existence is brought home to our young readers.</P>
<P>In acknowledging my indebtedness to various people, let me first of all, mention Ms Sarjit Ramesh of Deccan Herald. But for her persuasion, I doubt if I would have ventured into this at all. I am grateful to Ms Parul Shah, Executive Director, The Printers ( Mysore ) Pvt.Ltd.…for readily giving me permission to publish the articles as a book. Thanks to Shri Pranesh Siravara of Prism Books Pvt Ltd., for undertaking this venture, to Professor V.S. Ramamurthy, Director National Institute of Advanced studies, Bangalore, for his encouragement, to my young colleague from Centre for Atmospheric Science, IISc, Bangalore, Dr Prosenjit Ghosh for his advice on a couple of chapters, friends Maire and Roger Gibson for going through a few chapters, to my friends and colleagues Professors Dilip Ahuja of NIAS, Arnab Rai Choudhuri of IISc, Bangalore, Professor Soumitra Sengupta of IACS, Calcutta for their comments on the manuscript. Those who made their perceptive comments on my cover design are Professor Indraneel Sen of IISc, Gautam and Anitha, my young colleagues at NIAS. Finally, I am indebted to my wife Nandita for her patience in having to listen to the same stories from me over and over again.</P>
