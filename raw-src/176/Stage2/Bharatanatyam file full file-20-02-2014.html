<P><em>WHY THIS BOOK....</em><em>. </em></P>
<P><em>SMT. THANKAMANI KUTTY, wonderful both as an artiste and a teacher of Bharatanatyam and Mohiniattam, has planned this book for the young ones who want to take their first steps in the exquisite dance form, Bharatanatyam which has no parallel in this country. I know of no other person who is better equipped than her for this job. She knows the form inside out, and she is as expressive on stage, in bringing out the unchanted sources of grace and majesty of it, as she is before her students who are electrified by her distinctive style of teaching. </em></P>
<P><em>Indian dance, in all its classical and regional varieties, is now a part of world culture, and is being accepted far beyond the national boundaries of the country, not only by immigrant Indians, but also by people of land who have little knowledge of, or exposure to, Indian culture. This shows that dance, along with music, is the most universal art form and can break the cultural barriers more easily than the rest. I therefore think it an excellent idea to write a simple manual in English, in which short, easy steps are shown towards achieving a credible command on these dance forms. Dance of course is more of a </em>‘‘<em>Gurumukhi Vidya</em>’’<em>(Guru-dependant discipline) than any other such arts, but oral tradition has long since been replaced by literate and lately, printed tradition and one must take all the advantages available in the form of media for communicating to a wider audience. A book on dance, particularly an intricate dance form like Bharatanatyam, does not lead to the mastery of the form automatically, nor does anyone harbour any illusion about that. But a book such as this is still a big help and saver of time and effort, as it provides access to information that can be used and absorbed even when one is not practising. </em></P>
<P><em>Smt. Kutty has done a fine job in writing this book. Her presentation is lucid and business like and I am sure young aspirants in Bharatanatyam will benefit immensely by making this book their constant companion. </em></P>

<P>FOREWORD </P>
<P><em>At no stage in the history of mankind have people universally taken so much of interest in the classical dances. </em></P>
<P><em>Long strides have been taken in every field of human endeavour, so it is but natural that these disciplines should also reflect the age. A standardised and systematic approach towards understanding these disciplines, is essential for further improvement. </em></P>
<P><em>In my long experience as a teacher of the dance form of Bharatanatyam. I have not known of any attempt having made so far, to standardise a syllabus for beginners, ensuring discipline, which is an indispensable part of learing, the basics of the said art form. </em></P>
<P><em>I have also realized that it is not enough for the teacher alone to know what is to be taught to the pupils at different levels. The teaching and learning process combine to create a common sharing ground of knowledge for teachers and pupils alike, when the pupils are made aware of the programme that the teacher intends to follow, in advance. This goes a long way towards creating a good teacher-student relationship. </em></P>
<P><em>I have written this book, based on the carefully formulated course of teaching that I have followed and have mainly adhered to ‘Bharata’s Natya Sastra’, Nandikeswara’s ‘Abhinaya Darpana’ and other books that I have used as reference. </em></P>
<P><em>My aim has been , to guide a sincere enthusiast of Bharatanatyam through the very basics of the form and thus to prepare him/her for the advanced stage of learning. </em></P>
<P><em>I also hope that my endeavour to systematize the general education of our classical arts would be beneficial to all the aspirants of Bharatanatyam and to the lovers of this art form. I aspire to bring about the basic schooling of Bharatanatyam, so that the outcome of the much devoted and painstaking practice does not go wasted. </em></P>
<P><em>I greatly acknowledge the encouragement received from Respected Sri Pabitra Sarkar, the Vice-Chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta. </em></P>
<P><em>Thankamani Kutty </em></P>

<H1>BHARATANÂTYAM </H1>

<H1>BHAVA RAGA TALA NATYAM </H1>
<P>BHARATANÂTYAM </P>
<P>A dance style truly Indian &amp; devotional in character which evolved from its ritualistic roots through the ages to its present highly developed fine art form. It owes its existence to royal patronage and the devadasis who practised and preserved it, aiming spiritual identification. Closely adhering to ‘Bharata’s Nâtya Sâstra’, a comprehensive compilation of the then prevailing dance, drama &amp; music between 4th Century and 1st Century B.C. and Nandikeswara’s ‘Abhinaya Darpanâ’, the name ‘Bharatanâtyam’ itself is about 200 years old and may have been compounded from the three syllables BHÂ (Bhâva or Emotion), RÂ (Râga or Melody), and TÂ (Tâla or Rhythm) and ‘NÂTYAM’ Or Drama. </P>
<P>IMPORTANCE OF HAND GESTURES </P>
<P>The art of hand gestures is so vast that it covers all the aspects of human life and the universe. They are capable of expressing a number of things, including abstract concepts like beauty and truth. The hands become the vehicle of ‘dance-speech’ and can translate song words into sign words. The language of hand guestures enables the dancer to express practically anything. It augments the communication, enhances the impact of Abhinaya and endows it with poetry. The hands have life-Hastaprâna and invest the classical dance form with an enchanting quality. </P>
<P>Nritta Hastâs are decorative hand gestures. It is used to enhance the beauty of the dance. </P>
<P>HASTA MUDRÂS </P>
<P>One of the striking features of the Indian Classical dances is the use of the hand gestures of ‘Hasta Mudrâs’. The hand gestures are taken from the two most authentic dance text books -Nâtya Shâstra &amp; Abhinaya Darpanâ. Hastâs are classified into three categories - NRITTA (pure dance), ASAMYUTA (Single) and SAMYUTA (double) hastâs. </P>

<P>MAJOR LIMBS AND MINOR LIMBS </P>
<P>‘Ângika’ is named as such because it is expressed in three ways by Anga, Pratyanga and Upânga. Ângg : The six, such as, head, hands, chest, sides (fks), waist (hips) and feet are called Angas. The neck may also be included among these. Pratyanga : The six, such as, shoulder-blades, arms, back, belly, thigh calves and shanks are called Pratyangas. Three move, may be added, such as wrists, elbows and knees to this. </P>
<P>Upânga : Scholars call shoulder an Upânga, and eyes, eyebrows, eyeballs, cheeks, nose, jaw, lips, teeth, tongue, chin and face are also called Upângas. </P>
<P>The following sloka emphasises the esence of dance : </P>
<P>YATO HASTA STATÖ DRISHTI YATO DRISHTI STATÖ MANA YATO MANA STATÖ BHÂVO YATO BHÂVA STATÖ RASA </P>
<P>That is : </P>
<P>Where the hand goes, the glance follows Where the glance leads, the mind follows Where the mind goes, the mood follows Where the mood goes, the real flavour is born </P>
<P>COSTUME FOR PRACTICE </P>
<P>ARAMANDALI POSITION </P>
<P>34 </P>
<P>ADAVUS : BASIC DANCE STEPS (KARANÂS) </P>
<P>ADAVUS are the basic steps of Bharata Nâtyam which combine the symmetrical postures, movements of the limbs and the decorative hand gestures - both major and minor strictly adhere to the geometrical figures e.g. circles, squares, angles etc. It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of ADAVUS to achieve perfection in Bharata Natyâm. All the ADAVUS are set to eight beats. </P>
<P>ÂDI TÂLAM notation </P>
<P>All initial steps (adavus) are set to Âdi tâlam. 422 100 </P>
<P>Thakadhimi thaka jhonu The main ADAVUS are as follows : </P>
<P>(1) TATTADAVU : In Âyata position the feet strikes the floor alternately with the sole. The four important variations of TATTADAVU are as follows : 12 34 56 78 TAI YÂ TAI – TAI YÂ TAI – BEAT – BEAT – BEAT – BEAT – BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT </P>
<P>BEAT BEAT BEAT – BEAT BEAT BEAT – BEAT – BEAT – BEAT BEAT BEAT – </P>
<P>(2) NÂTTADAVU : ‘NÂTTA’ (ÂLIDHA) means to stretch. From the ARAMANDI (ÂYATAPÂRSHVA feet position), one leg is stretched outwards in any direction striking the floor with the heel (ANCHITA feet position) and is then brought back to the original position or behind of the other PÂRSHVA feet position. There are thirteen important variations of this ADAVU. </P>
<P>The syllables are as follows : </P>
<P>TAI YUM TAT THÂ TAI YUM TÂ HÂ </P>
<P>a) The hand movements for NÂTTADAVU start with ADHASTHALA TRIPATÂKA mudra in both arms stretched sideways horizontally. Taiyum when the foot is in Alidha (or Natta) position, the respective hand is upturned as UTTHÂNA and for TATTA it becomes ADHASTHALA again. </P>
<P>b) The same movements as described above are repeated twice on each side. </P>
<P>c) The hands and feet for Tai Yum Tat Tha are same as (a). For ‘Tai’ the right TRIPATÂKA is drawn near the right side of the chest as UTTHÂNA simultaneously </P>
<P>35</P>
<P>the right toes hit the floor behind the left foot. On ‘Yum’ the left foot is stamped, at the same time the right hand becomes ADHASTHALA.On ‘TA’ the right hand is again pushed out to its former position as UTTHÂNA and the right foot is in ALIDHA and ANCHITA foot position. On ‘HA’ the hand becomes ADHOMUKHA and the foot comes back to the starting position. Same movements are repeated on the other side. </P>
<P>d) The movements of (c) are repeated twice on each side. </P>

For TAI YUM TÂ HÂ same movements are repeated on the other side. The hand gestures are KATAKÂMUKHA &amp; ALAPADMA. </P>
<P>k) This variety is jumping with both feet on TAI, stamping the right heel on YUM, the left foot is brought behind the right foot on TAT and these last two sequences are repeated three times finishing at the starting position. The hand gestures are the same as (j). </P>
<P>During the faster speed, the 2nd step in case of (j) and the 2nd, 4th &amp; the 6th step in case of (k) is done with stamping the foot (for the right and left side) instead of the heel. </P>
<P>l) The right TRIPATÂKA hand from NÂTYÂRAMBHA posture is lowered near the right toes for TaI. The body is also bent down alongwith the lowered hand. For YUM, the PARSHVA-ÂYATA, left foot is stamped. For TAT, the lowered hand is raised above the head, simultaneously the right toes hit the floor behind the left foot. Fot THÂ, the left foot is again stamped. This sequence is repeated three times after which the adavu finishes with TAI TAI DHI THI TAI which has to be explained in class. </P>
