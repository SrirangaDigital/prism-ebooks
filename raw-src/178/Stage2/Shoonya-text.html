<H3>Introduction </H3>
<P>his existence is so mysterious – every moment we are baffled by its esoteric nature, by its irrational surprises and the </P>
<P>plethora of wondrous paradoxes it throws upon us. </P>
<P>There is no reason as to why the rivers flow or the mountains remain stationary. There is no rationale as to why only birds fly and humans do not. There is no purpose as to why there is a Universe in itself under the sea or in the atomic world. There may not be a good reason for the cause and effect. However, in the larger realm, perhaps it is this flux–like nature of existence that keeps us going and keeps us moving with the wheel of life, of being alive and vibrant. Perhaps it is this consistency in the inconsistency that has simulated an aura of intrigue carrying the freshness every time you come to think of it. In fact, there is an absolute perfection in this imperfection because it seems all dimensions of complexities are induced in the right quantum so that existence poses a certain quality of equilibrium, strong enough to make sure science or logic cannot conquer the nuances of its mystic or esoteric nature. </P>
<P>Is humanity greater than Godliness? This question will always baffle us in its limited framework. Is Ego good or bad? It is so natural to persist, to breathe or make an identity in this material world. Is there any purpose for attempting to understand Godliness? What sense does it make to contemplate on things that have always remained intangible right from when the Universe was born? These are some of the strongly ingrained subconscious conditionings we have been impregnated with. Fortunately, there are no straight </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>answers since even the questions may have no meaning. That is why life is so interesting. </P>
<P>The multitude of expressions life throws at us are subtle gestures of Godliness. The vivacious energy that encompasses us works dualistically – it gives you the aura to elevate spiritually and at the same time opens up the equally complimentary world of Maya so that our being can jostle in this flux, flow in this contradiction and glide through the paradoxical maze of endless enigma. </P>
<P>Shoonya is a stateless state, an absolute nothingness, where neither space nor time has an identity. In fact, language is impotent to express this statelessness because it cannot be rationalized. It’s measureless, dimensionless, stateless and any attempt to define it will only fall short of it. Even the word nothing can (in some sense) be something as in space or emptiness. However, Shoonya is far subtler and hence, the word “nothingness” (which is the “qualitative attribute” of the word “nothing”) can come closest in language to it though it is still incomplete. This spiritual–abyss, this all–pervading energy (again energy maybe the closest language that can describe nothingness) – Shoonya – is the final destination. This Shoonya is the abode of Godliness. This Shoonya is what you are. This Shoonya alone is you. </P>
<P>And the most ironical and beautiful part of all this linguistic hypotheses is the fact that all this can be discussed and comprehended only in the realm of Maya. This Shoonya is an expression only in this state where there is constant flux of Maya and divinity; this Shoonya can be battled only through the channel of ego–energy. When Shoonya is exposed in its naked form, there is no knowledge or intellect or consciousness. There is no such word such as Godliness or even nothingness when Shoonya stands in its absoluteness. Words such as bliss, statelessness, divinity – all have evaporated leaving behind pure isness. This pure isness is you… and you alone! </P>

<H2>Existence is omnipresent for an awakened being </H2>
<P>ne of the most interesting phenomena that occur naturally to a traveller on the spiritual path is the realization that </P>
<P>existence is witnessed literally in everything, including even the non–living things. For this awakened being, existence is omnipresent right from the living cells of an animal to the atomic world of inanimate (non–living) things. </P>
<P>Existence is not about breath. Nor is it about the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. In fact, it has nothing to do with it. It is the energy, the Universal energy that pervades in all of us including the plants, stones, rocks, ether and every other thing. Existence can be witnessed as omnipresent if we become more </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>reflective to our inner being and to our surroundings. Existence </P>
<P>warps in and out of us. </P>
<P>Just as it is difficult to separately witness a wave from an ocean or an ocean from a wave, it is hard to see how existence warps in and out of us. It’s impossible to separate the existence of you outside the existence of the Universe (and the converse is equally true – it’s impossible to separate the existence of the Universe outside your being). The microcosm is the macrocosm of existence and the macrocosm exists as a whole of the microcosm. And this is the beauty of it all: a close witness takes you deeper and deeper into this existence and as you hit the abyss of infinity your discrimination of living and non–living things becomes thinner and thinner; existence simply surfaces as one unified entity of which you are a part (and of which you are a part from). In fact this is the pivot on which the philosophy of Ramanujacharya’s Vishistaadvaita stands. </P>
<P>It may be alarming to accept this from a conventional perspective but for a spiritual traveller all non–living things have their own language of existence and they talk to each other. Every subatomic particle is interlinked to the entire array of existence. In reality, when one subatomic particle moves, the entire array of existence shifts by a certain unit to readjust the dynamics so that Universal equilibrium is always the same. There is a coherent, integrated, tightly coupled aura that interconnects everything literally; this universal energy binds everything. If change </P>
<P>happens at the micro level, changes happen at the macro level as </P>
<P>well in the same dimension and this helps in keeping the Universal equilibrium balanced. </P>
<P>We have this “perception” that only humans are aware of existence and that plants don’t have any emotion. However, several experiments have demonstrated various interesting insights about plants. </P>
<P>In 1900, Jagadish Chandra Bose, a famous Indian scientist, conducted experiments to show that plants grow much faster and are much healthier when soothing music is played in the background; their growth becomes slow and stunted if loud/ harsh music is played in the background. An American scientist, Cleve Backster, took this hypothesis to the next level. He demonstrated (with the help of a Polygraph/Galvanometer system) that plants also have emotions. In his simple system where the plants were tied to a galvanometer, the pen of the galvanometer drew lines/curves etc. based on the biological / physiological state of the plants. Experiments subjecting the plants to fire or to soothing human emotions showed consistent patterns on the output of the galvanometer. These experiments were very successful. One plant could recognize a human standing in front of it (one who had ill–treated the plant sometime back) and this demonstrated the fact that plants carried memories too! </P>
<P>And this is not the all of it. Experiments done by various researchers have shown that there is a secret language in all forms of existence – with life or no life. Stones, rocks etc. all have an integral language of existence. The Universal energy just warps infinitely. It’s a deep awakening. As your spiritual experiences elevate, you will find that you are more and more a part of the Universal existence; individual identities will cease to exist and forms get interspersed infinitely. The being just stands naked without any inkling of its truest form. </P>

<H2>Witnessing distraction is the key for meditation </H2>
<P>hen one meditates, distraction is only a natural occurrence. Unfortunately, most people who meditate think distraction is a hindrance; they try and stress themselves in an attempt to stay away from distraction. This is perhaps the single biggest mistake that one does while meditating. Distraction is not a hindrance to meditation but a gateway; a distraction forms a channel or a bridge to reflect on, to acknowledge, to embrace and to transcend. The more you try to concentrate or the more you get averse to distraction, the harder it becomes to get into the groove of meditation. </P>
<P>The essential point here is to move with the chaos, to move with the distraction. It is supposed to be that way. Distraction acts as a catalyst in giving the much required edge to dive into the </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>unknown. Distraction is a carrier and the vehicle on which meditation plies. Consider each distraction (distinct sounds around you etc.) to be a part of your meditative spirit. Acknowledge each of them as they come in. You will suddenly realize the power of this acknowledgement. Each time you acknowledge a distraction, the mind settles down and becomes calmer and calmer. The acknowledging itself becomes an act of living in the moment. By and by, this will make the mind more harmonic and in–tune with the surroundings. You will see that the so–called noise has transformed into music of your liking. Distraction metamorphoses to an absolute lullaby of spiritual awakening! </P>
<P>Many times, the thoughts themselves seem to be the biggest distraction; however, in reality, as we acknowledge each of these thoughts they seem to gradually harmonize and evaporate. Between each thought the awareness of a gap will eventually grow of its own accord. As the holistic embracement of thoughts becomes seasoned, you will witness more and more of silent gaps; the frequency of thoughts becomes lesser. There is this subtle moment when thoughts are in perfect harmony and they seem to have disappeared of their own freewill. Transcendence of thoughts shall surface as this practice reaches perfection leaving behind an engulfed abyss of absolute silence. This transcendence is the key and this can happen only by witnessing the distraction, not by being averse to it. Transcendence can happen only by embracing the distraction, not by rejecting it. Witnessing distraction in totality is the only way to start the beginning of a new journey! </P>

<H2>Faith manifests from Intuition </H2>
<P>aith arises predominantly out of intuition. It is finally one’s intuition that actually leads to a faith system. Intuition itself is a subconscious process; it works at a level beyond logic and mind. And that’s the precise reason why it’s called “Intuition” and not “Inference”. Faith never arises out of logic and if it did, it doesn’t become faith but Inference. </P>
<P>Personally, I don’t quite understand the term “Blind Faith” because in my opinion faith can only be blind (as in purely intuitive); it cannot be a process of rationality. If there is a term called “Blind Faith” then are we saying that there is a term called “Logical Faith”? It’s absurd! In some of the intellectual circles, humanity has coined this term “Blind Faith”. Actually, the nature of faith itself is supposed to blind with no reason. This is why </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>faith is called “pure religiousness”. It is never rational, never goes by logic and never depends on science or mathematics. It’s very hard to draw a line and say “this is blind faith and this is not”. Where shall we draw the line? </P>
<P>A person offering prayers in a temple is as eligible to be part of a complete faith system as is one who may NOT believe in going to temples (self realization). It does not really matter what is your “approach”. The fact remains that each is bitten by the stigma of a certain faith system. </P>
<P>The root cause of faith is the underlying dormant intuitive energy and this intuition is a very powerful form of consciousness. It carries a certain spiritual and paranormal element in it. Great discoveries of Science or feats of spiritual enlightenment have been accomplished merely by this spirit of intuition. People like Newton, Einstein, Ramanuja, Shankara, Buddha etc. were very intuitive and hence, they could accomplish something very dominant and strong. </P>
<P>One may be an atheist or a theist, it does not matter. One may be an antagonist or agnostic or anarchist – it does not matter. The fact remains that every human ultimately depends on a certain faith element that cannot be cognized through logic and rationality. Intuition predominantly arises from faith and this fact must not be missed. As we begin to think on these lines, respect and compassion for all kinds of beliefs (debatable) arises. It’s important to acknowledge this human trait. </P>

<H2>Destiny &amp; Freewill are complimentary </H2>
<P>estiny is often misunderstood in that either it’s completely negated (by people who believe in freewill) or is completely accepted (by people who believe that life is prepackaged and nothing can be changed – as in Karmic outcome). </P>
<P>The hypothesis of the Karmic theory only postulates that every effect has an underlying cause; it simply says that life is an echo– system of cause–and–effect. However, karma theory doesn’t take into account “reason for cause” in the absolute sense. This must be deeply understood. There is a ‘happening’ that you will encounter because of some of your past actions. But what made that action happen? Karma doesn’t account for that in the absolute sense and that’s exactly where “freewill” comes into picture. Each moment, the coordinates of your existence in the wheel of life, </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>has a mix of karma and freewill. There are certain things that are bound to happen and which cannot be controlled because of your past actions (in vedantic terms this is referred to as prarabhdha karma); at the same time, there are certain things on which you can take action to control your future (this is your freewill). </P>
<P>For instance, in the so–called chain of births and deaths, your soul manifests as part of the wheel of life and this cannot be avoided. This is karmic outcome. However, with your present action, the “way your soul leaves the manifestation (death) in the future” may be controlled. This may seem to be as ambiguous, paradoxical and inconsistent as it is in reality. And this is its inherent beauty. In reality, the beauty of existence is that there is an “arbitrary” mix of both karma and freewill. This flux is paradoxical but it exists. Hindu tattva depends heavily on this conjunction of karma and freewill. Lord Krishna’s Gita is a meeting point of this. If you deeply reflect and witness your being, you can feel the trace of both Karmic energy and the energy of freewill as part of your existence. </P>
<P>Further, it must be understood that your present action need not be (always) an absolute factor of freewill; it can also be an outcome of your past action, interspersed with the power of freewill. It can also be an absolute outcome of your past action alone. In other words, the ‘happening’ itself could be your ‘current action’. </P>
<P>For instance, a person may (for no specific reason that he can understand) feel like taking a walk. He enters into a park. A snake bites him and he dies. This incident must be deeply reflected upon. The feeling that “he wants to walk” may itself be an outcome of his past action. Also, the fact that “he wants to go to a park” results from his action taken on “the thought that he </P>
<P>wants to walk”. That he went to the park is another happening </P>
<P>stemming from his previous action of “thinking that a park is the place where he would like to walk”. Finally the snake bit him. In this story, it’s very difficult to say what is freewill and what is karma. However, the point to note is that there is no ground rule saying praarabha karma always is a happening; it could also manifest from the form of an action you are currently engaged in. A deeper analysis of life unfolds the mystical unfathomable effects of karma and freewill. </P>
<P>The other important aspect of karma to understand is the fact that karmic effects need not be staggered across different lives; the cause–and–effect can very well manifest within the same life iteration (within one cycle of birth and death). An action of the current moment can even result into the effect of the next moment. Nothing is guaranteed in the framework of the cause–and–effect except for the fact that every cause will be followed by an effect (and every effect shall have an underlying cause that manifested it). Also, there need not always be a single effect associated to a cause; the effects could be single or multiple – occurring at different points in time or these could be staggered across different lives as well. </P>

<H2>Death is only another form of Birth </H2>
<P>ost of humanity seems to have a misconception or rather a pseudo–conditioning about death and its after effects; this has instigated a subconscious, psychological and genetic–fear in people. The very thought of Death sends a shiver and people shudder. This is a complete irony of the life cycle. </P>
<P>Death is only an occurrence, an event that comes in its cyclic order. It’s a passing bridge to your next birth (manifestation of the soul). Technically speaking, Death actually initiates another Birth. The soul or the spirit that manifested in this Birth into this world will project one more manifestation after Death. The culmination of this manifestation is essentially a germination of the next; it’s not an end to itself. The spirit or soul just shifts its house, its true nature being the same – nothing more. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>Like the Sunset for one part of world is actually a Sunrise for </P>
<P>another part at the same time, so is the cause and effect of Birth and Death. To be precise, your spirit or soul just leaves the physical body and gets caged into a new dimension of another world – which may or may not resemble the current world. What actually matters is the fact that the soul has transmigrated in its journey to the next level which means its maturity has gone one step further so that your being (the spirit, the soul) is now much closer to oneness, to your actual home. That is the reason why in many communities they Sing and Dance when someone dies – it’s a celebratory moment. </P>
<P>There is a certain reflection, a catharsis that is essential to get triggered into this plane of consciousness and that comes directly from the inquisitiveness of pondering over “Where was I before I came to this world?” This is one of the most fundamental questions in Upanishadic–schools of thought. Regular contemplation of this question will lead your consciousness to a plane of complete acceptance and realization of the cycle /chain of births and deaths. </P>
<P>However, interestingly, there are chances that the spirit which leaves the body at the time of Death may not take the next form of manifestation at that very instant; in fact, the “Astral Body” sometimes may linger about for a longer time due to some of the “Unsatisfied” or “Deeply Affected” Conditioning and Desires in the current world. This may for sometime make the Spirit hibernate in the current world, neither finding its way to the new world nor retaking its shape back in the old world. It is such spirits that are actually seen as Ghosts haunting (of course, this is debatable and personal to the experience of an individual) their former precincts. </P>
<P>Death is just a label for another Birth. </P>
<P>If you reflect on where you came from onto this Earth, onto this Universe, it may baffle you initially; however, by and by, as you meditate on your being, there is a mystic witness you encounter which makes one aware that “I never ever died.” You (as in your soul) neither can die nor be born. The real you (the soul) is just an eternal state, a stateless state. The identity of your form, your name etc. are mere manifestations. In Zen and in Shankara’s Advaitic school of thought, they exercise and meditate on one Golden Question: “Who am I?” This is one of the most profound questions which the Vedic school also dwells upon. We discover that there are several layers as we meditate on this question. It first answers that you are NOT your name, then that you are NOT your body, and then that you are NOT your feelings; further, that you are NOT your mind, and if you aren’t your identity either, then that you are NOT the breath and so on and so forth. The meditation comes to a point where you realize you are nothing but a witness to this existence and that you are nothing but a being; this finally ends with the dawning realization “you are nothing but a state of nothingness”. </P>
<P>Death is just a transition into another manifestation. Your identity came into this Universe arbitrarily based on your karmic effects. As your body dies, a new birth, a new manifestation dawns; but the “you” remains as–is. Your soul is just a projector, projecting one movie after another. The movies change, the projector remains eternally the same. Death is just a 5 letter word, a label to another manifestation. </P>
<P>Also, there is a very thin hairline difference between being identified with this world and not. And this subtlety is everything. </P>
<P>Fear of death comes only when you find yourself belonging to this Universe. By default, we are identified by this existence. We feel we are part of it. And we believe we should be attached to it. Everything looks so real. Just like when you wake up from sleep you realize that it was after all only a dream (but very real within the dream–world itself), so too is this so–called real world in front of us. Meditation only helps to show that this Universe (movie), this manifestation, is just another bigger and longer dream. Just like a rope wavering in the semi–darkness (due to the breeze fluttering it) that was mistaken to be a snake, and just like a mirage that looks as real as total–internal–reflection – so too is this identification. </P>
<P>There is a very easy way to misidentify with the Universe; you just have to try hiding from yourself and the real truth surfaces. </P>
<P>Meditation is the key to everything; it just makes you realize how simple life is and how simple is the mystery around you. Meditation has the power to break all paradoxes and melt all hypotheses. It makes you realize you are always a child and this childlikeness is the only reality. The utter simplicity of godliness / existence gets unfolded, leaving behind just absolute emptiness </P>
<P>– the Shoonya. Cycle of Deaths and Births are only movies screened on the periphery, one after another; the core remains the same. If you can meditate and witness that each one is just a movie, you will love the experience of death. Drop the fear and embrace this wilderness. You can see many communities dance for Death; this is because it’s a celebration for a new manifestation. You fear because you think this Universe (movie) is eternal which it is NOT. A meditation on your self misidentifies you – you are the projector and then the movie is no more. Death is just a Leela, a charade, a screensaver. </P>

<H2>Polar energies are complimentary and the same </H2>
<P>nergies of desire and control actually are one and the same energy. The form it takes is different but the core energy stems from the same source. For instance, a person who tries to control desires actually is also someone who is very much addicted to desires. It’s the same source that controls these energies. A person who can laugh from the heart is also the person who can very easily be moved to tears because the root of the energy is the same. A person identified with this life will always be in that vicious loop. It is not possible to be a part of the material clinging and yet at the same time be a liberated soul because the source of energy that is kindling both is the same. That is why we cannot overcome suffering, worries, pain etc. as we are conserving the same energy for pleasures, happiness and comfort. This source of energy has to be deeply understood – where it </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>stems from and why it takes different forms, and yet is the same energy. These polar energies actually are not contradictory but complimentary. At the periphery they seem opposite but deep within they are the same. They are two faces of the same coin – with a different embossment on either side. </P>
<P>Thus, in the Wheel of Life, control of desires or moderation of attachment to the material world actually doesn’t solve the problem. The problem can be addressed only by way of reflection, witnessing, meditation and transcendence. The word “balance” actually is a fictitious pseudo state which gives positive vibes at the outset and by definition. In reality, the state of “balance” itself is a simple pendulum with joys and sorrows in its realm and boundary. You will see that the more you try to like something there is always something else which you dislike in the same degree. The more you are attached to something, the more detached you are to something else. Once again, this is because of the complimentary energies of Ying and Yang. </P>
<P>In his famous book The Prophet, poet and philosopher Kahlil Gibran says the following: </P>
<P>“Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven? And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?” </P>
<P>When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is now giving you joy. </P>
<P>The message is clear. If you want to get away from suffering, you also have to give up pleasures. If you want to get away from <SPAN>pain, you also have to give up comfort. If you want to get away from sorrow, you also have to give up joy. If you want to get away from worries, you also have to give up happiness. And lastly, if you are averse to detachment, you also have to be equally averse to attachment. The only way out is to become reflective, go deep into your core, witness your inner being, witness your Indriyas, witness your chakras and become more and more meditative. Meditation leads you to a zone of ZERO TOLERANCE where suffering and pleasures recede leaving behind only peace. You enter this gateless gateway where polar energies are neither opposite nor complimentary – they just exist in their true state without any form; at this juncture, all definitions evaporate and even this current understanding stands meaningless! </SPAN></P>

<H2>World is as real as it’s unreal </H2>
<P>n the theosophical spheres of thinking, one always wonders (this is debated over and over again in multi–disciplinary schools of philosophies) whether the world we experience is real? And if real, how different is God from it? And if unreal, what then is real? </P>
<P>This world, this life, this Universe, this existence, your very being is an expression of the divine. It is not the divine itself in the absolute sense; at the same time, it’s not devoid or isolated from the divine either. </P>
<P>Just like a tree that manifested from a seed, so is this existence, this Universe, a manifestation of the divine. Just as the tree cannot exist independently of the seed from which it mushroomed, so too our existence cannot be independent of the divine. Just as </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>fire cannot be separately understood from the heat it produces, so is this existence and its relation to the divine. Just as the ice cannot be separately visualized outside of the water, so is this existence and its relation to the divine. Just as an ocean cannot be separately cognized from the waves, so is this existence and its relation to the divine. </P>
<P>Adi Shankara proposed the beautiful term Ishvara for this dualistic existence of God and Illusion. Ishvara is not the divine and yet is the divine. Ishvara is the expression of the divine; it’s the form of the divine but not the divine itself in the absolute sense. Ishvara in the Upanishadic (vedantic) term is called the Saguna Brahman </P>
<P>– that Godliness, who has taken a form, is an illusion ‘manifested’ as part of the divine. The so–called Nirguna Brahman is that when Ishvara doesn’t exist – which actually means the divine in the absolute sense (no form, no expression, and no manifestation). This utter emptiness referred to as Nirguna Brahman is the absolute truth, the absolute consciousness and the absolute bliss (as in Sat– chit–ananda). Ishvara is an expression that embodies the coexistence of the states of the Divine and Illusion. </P>
<P>The divine takes this form as Ishvara (maya and divine coexisting) and the being (who is also part of the Ishvara in creation). He who realizes this duality and the paradoxical nature of Ishvara (and yet exists in human form) is called Jivatman in Hindu tattva. Ishvara is actually a catalyst, a tool in itself for the Jivatman to transcend this duality and become the sublimated being referred to as Jiva Mukti. </P>
<P>Hence, this existence is neither real nor unreal in its absolute sense. At the pragmatic level it coexists; at the transcendental level, it’s just the emptiness; Ishvara itself dissolves. All that is left is the sat chit ananda. </P>

<H2>Consciousness and Godliness are inter-related </H2>
<P>ind is just a flow of thoughts. It’s the flow of electricity between neurons inside the Brain that simulates the flow of thoughts. Even the sensory network is part of the Brain and the Mind facilitates the flow of “experiences” from the senses. Mind and Brain are tangible at least so far as biological/ scientific interpretation is concerned. Consciousness is outside the Mind. Consciousness is the “awareness” that “I am”. It is the “sense of I am”. Consciousness has “no thoughts”; it is just the point of reflection, the awareness of the being. Consciousness is very subtle, far subtler than the Mind because thoughts have ceased to exist in the state of consciousness, i.e. its pure awareness. Meditation can take you to this state of alertness, this state of consciousness, this state of noiseless–awareness where Mind is arrested and the being simply exists. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>However, it must be noted that Consciousness is also a term of “subjectivity”. If we say we are “conscious”, it means there is a duality already established – there is “an object of which we are conscious “. So, there is still that sense of Ego but this is very subtle in nature. There is a Witness and hence “an object that is witnessed” and “a subject that witnesses”. Even though thoughts have ceased, the consciousness of “I am” itself still creates the duality. Hence, this is still not the state of ultimate Godliness. Godliness is much subtler than consciousness. Godliness is beyond consciousness. There is no duality in Godliness. There is NO one who witnesses and there is nothing that is witnessed; there is only the “witnessing” in Godliness. A very fragile elementary thought process still lingers in Consciousness that is so fragile that it’s almost empty; absolute emptiness can surface only when consciousness evaporates leaving behind nothingness. </P>
<P>As an allegory of the above, when a dancer is dancing, there is the Dancer (the physical body), the thought that “I am dancing”, the consciousness or witness of the “sense of dance” and the “Dance itself”. The thought that “I am dancing” is of the Mind. The “awareness” of the dance is that of “consciousness” and the dance by itself is Godliness. In consciousness, there is the “dancer” and the duality of “my being is dancing”. The consciousness gives you two states: the “awareness of dancing” and “the person who witnesses the dancing”. In Godliness, it’s just the dancing alone – there is neither the dancer nor the witness to the dance. It may not be an apt example but nonetheless gives one some food for thought. </P>

<H2>Purposelessness is the language of life </H2>
<P>t is you who gives (attempts to give) meaning to life; life by itself has NO purpose (intent) to provide meaning to anyone. </P>
<P>It’s like how you can create a pot or a doll or a rosary of beads from a lump of clay. The clay by itself has no purpose even though the doll or the pot may appear to have some significance (meaning). It is you who attempts to derive “logic” from life; life by itself is illogical in its true nature. It is you who desires life to be perfect; life by itself is imperfect in its true sense. It is you who attempts to make your life strategic and consistent; life by itself is absolutely inconsistent and un–strategic. Finally, it is you who attempts to derive a purpose from this life; life by itself is purposeless. This is the reason why our desires never connect with our contentment!!! </P>
</SECTION>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<SECTION>
<P>Life is neither positive nor negative in an absolute sense; it’s an amalgamation of both the energies. The opposite polarities co– exist and duality is the reality upon which existence thrives. That said, the ever–changing dynamism is life. The inconsistency and the fight against our desires and ego is the actual blossom of life that must be absorbed. Life cannot be seen to be defined in colours; it can only be absorbed by the myriad of shades it can throw on us. Language has produced a psychological barrier to differentiate the good from the bad. It has put labels and frames for every occurrence of life but while reflecting deeper, we need to mask the chattering language in our mind and feel life more holistically. We need to glide with life rather than try to design something that stops the flow of energy for this doesn’t work. Lord Krishna, in the Gita, always said life is a leela (play) and this is a reality that must be deeply reflected upon. </P>
<P>The more you try to derive meaning from life, the more life unfolds its mysticism. The more you search for the purpose of life, the farther it goes into purposelessness. Life is NOT a prose (which is structured with a template); life is more like POETRY (which is intuitive with no rules and structure). </P>
<P>We try to put a frame around life and attempt to define a purpose to it but deep down life is frameless and the purposelessness is its hidden language. </P>
<P>Life is NOT about Intelligence, it’s about Wisdom. Life is NOT about Security, it’s about Freedom. Life is NOT about Beauty, it’s about Ecstasy. Life is not about Challenges, it’s about Wonder. Life is NOT a Lake (which is stagnant and consistent in shape and form); it’s like a River (which is continuously flowing and ever–changing in its form and character). </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<P>At the core, life is all about passiveness. Life by itself opens no choice; we make choices. Life by itself is illogical; we try and give it meaning and logic. Life by itself has no shame, no dimension, no identity, and no definition. All definitions and dimensions are Man’s “take” on life. Life remains unaffected regardless of what man takes away from it. </P>
<P>It’s like an empty boat sailing at it’s freewill in a river. By itself, the boat has no expectations of how to sail. By itself, the boat has no destinations. By itself, the boat has no desires or a definition of how to sail and at what speed. It’s only when you onboard, that the boat gets the “perception” of dimension. </P>
<P>The reflection here is a little deeper than what is apparent. Man has forgotten the true state of life – the state of absolute passiveness, the ecstasy of blissful emptiness and the freedom of nothingness. Life by itself is an infinite dimensionless mirror. It “seems” only as real as your taking from it. </P>
<P>There may be a cause–n–effect within material actions (for instance, if you throw a stone up, it comes down due to gravity) but the actions themselves do not have a purpose at the larger level (why one threw the stone up?). Lord Krishna’s Gita expresses </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<P>the wisdom of Karma which is a cause and effect system. The </P>
<P>cause and effect does work in this framework but it must be remembered that the cause–n–effect by itself has no purpose (Gita explains this as well). God’s language is symbolic; there are NO lyrics or grammar. </P>
<P>Purposelessness is the very purpose of existence!!! </P>

<H2>Meditation is NOT the last resort of the spiritual journey </H2>
<P>editation gives you the glide and the gateway to jump into the ocean of consciousness, but it is not a state of Godliness in itself. It’s a seat of bliss where your material manifestations are shut and your mind is asleep. The being is oscillating beyond the conscious, subconscious and unconscious states of the mind, and there is the experience of acute emptiness. Thoughts have ceased and feelings have ceased. The body and mind have transcended. It’s an absolute condition of stateless equilibrium. However, the Ego still has a hairline connection to your being. </P>
<P>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa illustrates this beautifully in an allegory: It is like a bucket of water dipped into a well. A rope is controlling the bucket through the pulley on top of the well. The </P>
</SECTION>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<SECTION>
<P>bucket is full of water (Godliness) inside and is immersed in the </P>
<P>water of the well (pure Godliness) on the outside; the bucket still “lingers” about in the water as it is tied to the rope suspended through the pulley. Even though the “water in the bucket” (the being of the one who is meditating) is the same as the “water in the well” (Godliness), the rope (ego) still dangles between the pulley and the water in the well. Meditation also takes you beyond (in Sanskrit this is called Thuriya or Shoonya) to a place where neither the meditator nor the meditation exists. It is the free flow state where the water in the bucket and the water in the well have melted into one another and there is no entity of either the rope or the bucket (or the well). Pure infiniteness, pure isness floats infinitely. </P>
<P>Gaudapada (Adi Shankara’s guru’s guru) in his treatise agama shastra (which is an exploratory vision of Manudkya Upanishad) gives another similar allegory: An empty pot has space inside it and outside it. The space inside maybe an absolute state of bliss so far as the pot is concerned; however, the pot still separates the space inside it from the space outside. This pot must be shattered and broken to pieces so that the inner being melts into the oneness. When this barrier breaks, this layer of the pot (the space inside it) is no different from the space outside it – it just melts into oneness. The shell (layer of pot) only acts as a tool that finally dissolves (breaks open) leaving the pure emptiness inside to surface and merge with the emptiness outside. </P>
<P>Meditation is definitely the first step but not the last; it forms a bridge to heaven but ultimately it melts, leaving behind only the heaven! </P>

<H2>Life is an echo-system of your attitude </H2>
<P>his Universe is an interesting entity and life is an unfolding mystery. Do not panic if life is not giving what you crave </P>
<P>for because it is you who is actually creating the effect. Life never committed to anything when you were born; it’s an absolute echo system of what you seek. </P>
<P>You will see that the Universe mysteriously behaves in the way you see it. You will see that a person who is generally “scared to face crime in the city” will naturally see and hear more and more crime news everywhere as compared to others. Another person who feels “nothing is impossible” is convinced that the Universe is wondrous and always has opportunities open for him; for such a person life is a benediction. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>The point to reflect on is how the Universe unfolds and renders life to us. You are the architect of the outcome life offers to you. Universe by itself is neutral. Life at birth is only a skeleton by itself. It is your outlook and response to it that manifests the form and pattern of your life. </P>
<P>In fact, it is your beliefs, ideals, principles, and convictions that form a part of the overall equation of your life. The life you experience is yours alone; it’s a very personal experience. It may appear that this Universe is a common entity to all of us but that’s just a delusion. It may sound strange but each being witnesses and experiences an altogether new Universe and no two beings share the same world in the absolute sense. The experiences that life showers upon us is a reflection of our own beliefs, ideals, principles and convictions we have given back to the world. Life is just a mirror; it will reflect whatever your being dissipates. </P>
<P>We may not realize it but even the objects we perceive and feel are different for each of us. For instance, two people inside the same room will see the roof differently because the perspective view of one person is different from the other as it is based on the angle the eye–lens makes with the roof. In fact, to further complicate this viewpoint, based on the angle the eye–lens makes with the roof, one may see either a trapezium–shaped roof or a quadrilateral–shaped roof (even though the roof is rectangular in shape). But in reality, we go on asserting that we are seeing a rectangular–roof which is not the case. Similarly, one person touching the wall of the room may feel a slightly different sensation as compared to the other person depending on how sensitive one’s skin is to the texture of the wall and the temperature of the blood within his body. We are talking only at a sensory level. When we expand this logic to the mind, thoughts and consciousness then our ideals, principles and belief systems play a predominant role in shaping a Universe that is singular to our own personal experiences. </P>
<P>So, reflect on your thought process. Spend time reflecting on what behavior you have exhibited and observe the way life has responded to you. Be a witness to your response and behavior to life. Nurture your attitude to see life positively. Consciously develop the conviction that life has enough to offer you and actually this Universe is a mirror of your seeking. </P>
<P>Even as you begin this journey, your will see that your happiness has moved to an altogether new consciousness. When Universe unfolds in the way you consciously seek it, life itself becomes a blissful caterpillar morphing into a colourful butterfly! </P>

<H2>Children are the closest reflection of Godhood </H2>
<P>e as adults have the illusion that we are superior to<SPAN><Sub>W</Sub></SPAN>children. Our ego is challenged when we see children. We enjoy guiding them and making them think that we are their guru. It is in their interest to listen to us! Contrary to this, in reality, we as biased grown–ups do not perceive the divine qualities of the children. </P>
<P>The childlike quality of living in the moment, the blissful ignorance of the past, the innocent quality of not foreseeing the future, the ability to sleep like a log, the quality of waking up everyday with a zeal that “today is a new day and I am here to live it fully”, the timeless attitude to daily routine, the quality of speaking from the heart (and not through the mind), of being shameless and non–embarrassed about any action seen or done – I have seen nothing but sheer Godliness all–over (and inside) a child. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>One more interesting pointer: if you carefully watch the abdominal area of a small child of 2–4 years (smaller the better), you will observe that the child breathes from the stomach and not the chest. In the traditional meditation techniques, such as vipassana, it is highly recommended that one breathes from the stomach so that energy flows and the meditative spirit is awakened. We as adults breathe from our chests when left to ourselves and it requires a conscious effort to push our breath–control towards the stomach. This is just one of the many signs that Godliness rests so naturally in children; from the moment they come out of the womb, they breathe so naturally through the stomach. By and by as they grow up and become self–conscious, the ego sets in and breathing eventually moves to the chest centre. </P>
<P>Over time, as the child grows up into an adult, the treasure of childlike qualities are left behind without his awareness; the most essential attribute of “living in the moment” undergoes a paradigm shift to “living either in the past or in the future”. The attitude of “enjoy what you have this moment” is subconsciously suppressed and consciously forgotten. Ego takes the prime place, with or without our awareness, as we grow up into adults. The attitude of reflecting our inner being, of being receptive to what we have gets diluted as we grow up. </P>
<P>Today, when I see my young daughter, the one thing that comes to my mind always is that there is so much to learn from her. I don’t think I can teach even 1% of what I can learn from her. </P>
<P>We have Godhood diffused and flooded all around us; impregnated in most of simple things life has to offer. It takes just a moment to keep our ego and bias aside, to be a bit receptive to life and to reflect on it. We would then be in absolute freedom and ecstasy. You then don’t need a temple or a scripture; we just need to be a child in nature’s lap and the prayer emanates of its own accord! </P>

<H2>Neutrality is the Centre of Gravity for Happiness </H2>
<P>he factor of Happiness shall always remain a topic of ecstasy, a topic of mysticism and a topic of debate in the </P>
<P>fields of human study, psychology and spirituality. </P>
<P>Happiness is like the wave of an ocean – by the time you see the swell come up, the wave dies out. Happiness is like the arches of a rainbow – it gratifies your Ego with its beauty so much that even before you realize how much you are engrossed in it, it fades away. Happiness is like the ice that melts away even before you could define its boundary and form. </P>
<P>If you watch carefully, the Disappointment energy behaves pretty much like the Happiness energy – the same subjectivity, the same unpredictability, the same volatility, the same frequency and the same gravity. In fact, I would say Disappointment and Happiness </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>are just the same energy getting reflected in opposite mirrors in a different form. Happiness and Disappointment are two faces of the same coin. A pot made of clay is no different from the dirty soil that drains into the gutters. It has the same roots but a different form. The monkey mind is unaware and ignorant of the fact that deep down it is the same energy of the disappointment that it’s seeking, even as it chases the energy of Happiness. </P>
<P>The point of reflection is the understanding that being “Neutral” is the key to true Happiness. This doesn’t mean that one must not get engrossed in good things when they happen; neither does this mean that one has to be cold and unemotional when Disappointments surface. Being neutral is all about being reflective of the energy flow, of being watchful of the sense– organs and of the emotional patterns. Being neutral is about allowing your being to be seated in the plane of consciousness, watching your Ego rise–and–fall, watching your actions, watching consciously how the Happiness and Disappointments come (and go) wearing different masks while being the same energy form underneath. </P>
<P>If you acknowledge it, Neutrality is all about being “PEACEFUL”. The nature of Peace is neither that of Happiness nor that of Disappointment. The so–called Good and so–called Satan have no meaning in the state of Peace. Being Neutral is all about aligning our being to be reflective of this state of Peace (which we go on missing) in the race of being identified with our actions and thoughts. </P>
<P>One may argue that Happiness is far better than Peace; this is NOT true since Happiness is only a charade, underneath it’s just </P>
<P>the Desire energy. Peace has no form; it brings out in your being </P>
<P>the Quality of “Neutrality”. This neutrality is a just a science of being reflective, of living in the moment; neutrality is a meditative practice, a way of life, a new consciousness of attitude, a launch vehicle into blissful meditation. </P>
<P>Neutrality cuts across the Happiness and Disappointment waves, and leaves behind a beautiful world – serene and ecstatic. </P>
<P>This “neutrality” or “the meditative witness” must penetrate all the five layers of the body eventually. Patanjali (the father of Yoga sutras) defines these layers beautifully as: Annanmaya kosha (after the word anna, which means food) – this layer of the body is the physical body, the gross body, the sheath that germinates from the panchaboothas (food, water, air, fire, soil); this layer comes from the anna (food) and when the body dies, it goes back to the panchaboothas. Then there is prananmaya kosha which is the layer of body that is concerned with “breath” or “prana”. This sheath is much subtler than Annanmaya kosha and controls the indriyas. The third layer is manaanmaya kosha which is the sheath of the mind and intellect; this layer is even subtler than the first and the second, and provides the energy chakras for the prana and indriyas. The fourth layer, which is even subtler than these, is gyaanmaya kosha, the layer or sheath that encapsulates “consciousness” which can only be felt and is beyond science and tangibility. Witnessing happens through this kosha. Meditation happens in this kosha. The final layer (fifth) is the most subtle layer, the aanandamaya kosha which is the state of your being in absolute “neutrality” that we are talking about. Meditation germinates in gyaanmaya kosha and leaves you beyond that; the escape from the meditative state to the beyond is a state of aanandamaya kosha. It’s beyond any form and any state but it’s still a subtle layer of Maya </P>
<P>(identification or manifestation). Godliness shows up when all </P>
<P>these five layers are transcended. In Vedas, we also refer to this as Thuriya or Shoonya. Zen calls this the gateless gate and the stateless state. </P>
<P>In the context of neutrality, the practice will percolate your being gradually from Annanmaya kosha through aanandamaya kosha; this is what the word Yoga is all about – it’s a practice to bring in awareness to mind, body and soul and to penetrate these five layers through mere witness, reflection and transcendence. </P>
<P>Neutrality truly is the Centre of Gravity where Happiness and Disappointments converge, leaving the being in an ocean of splendor and mystery! </P>

<H2>All actions and thoughts are aligned concentric to the Ego </H2>
<P>t may sound absurd at the outset but if you reflect, every action (and thought) we go through is for the gratification of ones’ Ego. It really does not matter whether you are doing a work of philanthropy or a work of disruption to society – everything revolves in concentric circles with the core being your Ego. </P>
<P>Does this mean it doesn’t matter whether one performs actions pertaining to be the so–called Good or Bad? Yes and No. The answer is “Yes” in the framework of reality because doing the so–called “Good” is just choosing one more circle from the frame of concentric circles, the centre being the same (your Ego getting gratified); the answer is “No” in the material framework where so–called “Good” seems to have a more pleasing impact on one’s life than the so–called “Bad”. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>Understand this: when you do something good to others – you </P>
<P>get happiness; would you have done the deed if you didn’t get any happiness by doing so? Even when one does charity, the charity may be consciously done to help someone but deep down, subconsciously, the act of charity itself is done to get personal happiness (most times without awareness); if charity doesn’t result into personal happiness, would someone do it – think about it! Similarly, when you love someone, somewhere deep down you actually love yourself; you are craving for the happiness you get by loving. If you didn’t get this happiness, would you love someone just to keep the other person happy? When someone dear passes away, we cry; but why do we cry? We cry because “we are hurt”; we cry because “we feel heavy”; we cry because “we miss the dead”. We don’t actually cry for the dead; deep down we are actually crying for ourselves. By crying we are making sure our heaviness is shed. Our hearts become lighter and we can now look forward to more comfort and happiness. </P>
<P>This happiness we look forward to – in each and every action and thought (regardless of whether the thought or deed translates into a good or bad) – is because of our Ego, our desire to keep ourselves materially happy. </P>
<P>In essence, we laugh for a purpose and we cry for the same purpose (deep down). This requires a deep reflection although at the outset it appears very discouraging and flat. Everyone of us needs to ask only one single Question for every action we do (or for every thought we exercise) – “What am I doing this for” and you will find that after asking this question several times, it leads to only one centre – the centre of satisfying ones’ Ego. Is there anything wrong about it – NO; there is nothing right or wrong about it. However, a reflection, a holistic understanding brings </P>
<P>your spiritual elevation and consciousness to a totally different </P>
<P>level that is more elevated and much closer to your being. </P>
<P>You will see that the more you reflect on this, the more you become aware of your Ego. The more you witness this, the more you become conscious of your own selfishness that you have been living on without your awareness. The deeper you dwell in this understanding, the more you transcend your desires. The more you reflect on this, the more your life moves out of the concentric framework – to your actual core of nothingness. This reflection is one form of meditation known as Witness meditation; it finally brings your being to a state of standstill, to a state of absolute neutrality i.e. a state of Shoonya. </P>

<H2>Totality is the metamorphosis to Divinity </H2>
<P>he word “totality” here has a very profound meaning. Totality could either mean you are embracing life holistically or it could also mean you are rejecting life holistically. Godliness surfaces only when the induction to life is total. It does not matter whether you are a theist or an atheist or an agnostic – the question is whether you are in totality. </P>
<P>For a person in totality, a blade of grass is no different from the moon dancing in the sky. For such a person, life doesn’t come in instalments, it comes in completeness. Life impregnates his being in utter oneness; for such a being, life impregnates him in totality and life is omniscient, ecstatic and feverous. For such a soul, death is a celebration and the word “negative” is not there in the DNA of his consciousness. Life for such an individual is a leela – a play, a dance, a carnival, a celebration of cosmic music. Such a </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>soul has a different quality to his being – he pulsates with cosmic rhythm and melts in the myriad of challenges that life throws at him. </P>
<P>The most interesting point to remember is that totality can happen even through rejection, the process of elimination where Universe ends up as a mere delusion. But such a rejection, if it must happen in totality, should happen (and can happen) only through transcendence (and not by control). </P>
<P>Totality is all about absorbing life as–is, with NO categorization. </P>
<P>Have you observed that when we see a Sunrise, we immediately tend to add adjectives and labels to it such as “How beautiful the Sunrise is?”, “The colour of the sunrise is not that good today” and so on. On the contrary, when a child sees the same Sunrise (a child less than three years who doesn’t know how to speak) he doesn’t say or even feel anything good or bad about the Sunshine. For the child, its sheer acceptance as–is– with no labels, no adjectives and no categorization attached. The reason is, we as adults have lost the “childlike” attitude in us; we have become more rational, subjective, intellectual and speculative of life around us. We naturally jump upon things and immediately categorize these as Good/Bad, Ugly/Beautiful, Divine/Devil etc. This is the biggest root cause of all our problems. </P>
<P>Totality is the quality of being “childlike”, mesmerized in the ocean of utter innocence and being blissfully ignorant of what Good and Bad is. It is being ignorant about the opposite polarities </P>
<P>of life. The acceptance then becomes complete, and in this very </P>
<P>holistic–acceptance, Divinity surfaces. </P>
<P>I have heard people say, “I have lived life fully because I did this and I did that when I was at so and so age”. This is sheer stupidity. You cannot live life fully by what you have done earlier; likewise, you cannot live life fully by what you want to achieve in the future. You can live life fully only if your current moment is accepted in totality (and life continues every moment in that spirit). </P>
<P>If you can live this moment fully, then you will always live life in totality. If you miss living moment–to–moment – then regardless of what you have achieved in the past (or what you wish to achieve in the future) – you always remain incomplete and Godliness hides far away from you. </P>
<P>The other point was on Rejection. If you reject life, then Godliness cannot arise; if life rejects you then you transcend desires. At the peak, the entire life and universe is nothing but a liberated element of your being. But such transcendence can arise only by reflection of the moment, by witnessing your ego, by witnessing your desires, by being total even in this moment of transcendence. </P>
<P>Remember – life can be witnessed either as a Leela or as a void. Godliness can surface only when the ignition sparks from such a Leela or a void. Both Leela and Void are two faces of the same coin, the same energy form. </P>
<P>In totality, you don’t live life; in totality, you are life. In totality, </P>
<P>you are no more than an actor – you are the acting itself. In totality, you are no more the spiritualist, you are the spirit. </P>
<P>If we do not know how to live the moment, if we do not accept what life has offered to us holistically, if we cannot move in totality – we will always end up being in a desert chasing one mirage after another assuming each one to be an Oasis! </P>
<P>Let’s take a break! </P>

<H2>Silence is an absolute symbol of the Divine </H2>
<P>ilence is a gift of life, but unfortunately we go on missing the beauty of it. If you reflect for a moment, you will </P>
<P>observe that the human mind is a continuous chatter–box </P>
<P>– thoughts keep flowing in and out of it. Also, the gap between each thought is almost negligible. The mind is always cocooned either in the past or in the future, never in the moment where there is gold hidden in abundance. </P>
<P>Between each thought there is a moment of silence, a gap that’s ignored. In that silence dawns the wisdom. It is this silence upon which Buddha meditated. It is this silence upon which seers have contemplated for centuries. It is this silence that acted as the discovery point for the myriad of meditative techniques that have mushroomed. It is this very silence that opens the umbrella to the hidden mysteries of the Universe. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>You might have observed that the nights are so peaceful. When </P>
<P>you see the dark sky in the night from your roof terrace, you feel a vibration; energy pulsates in your being. Even in the ancient scriptures, they refer to night as being close to Godliness; it has its own singular feeling. Night symbolizes silence. </P>
<P>Similarly, when one is in deep sleep, there is absolute bliss. The unawareness of deep sleep itself is the ecstasy. The nothingness itself is completeness. The silence of deep sleep has a different quality to it. In Mandukya Upanishad, this silence is expressed as susupti – the state of deep sleep where conscious and subconscious minds have ceased, leaving behind an abyss of utter emptiness. This meditative state, in Vedic terms, is also referred to as Yoga Nidhra. </P>
<P>Meditation means living in this boundlessness, embracing this silence, impregnating this emptiness; it is where thoughts cease to exist, where there is an absolute vacuum, where knowing and being melt into one another, where the inner mirror (your being) reflects just pure infiniteness (the divinity). You just have to stop for a moment and reflect on the silence. This kindles the magic of awakening and the flowers of nature bloom! </P>

<H2>The abode of Godliness is hidden in sheer subtlety </H2>
<P>od lives in a very simple down–to–earth home. Humans<SPAN><Sub>G</Sub></SPAN>have unnecessarily made it look very complex. You just have to be a little alert – that’s all. Godliness is just there, right in and around you. In fact, you are it. Upanishads keep saying it – Thatt Thwam Asi (You Are It). </P>
<P>When you see the morning dew, a joy springs up in you and in this very joy, godliness thrives. When you laugh from your heart and your eyes are filled with tears of joy, in the very crescendo of this divine laughter Godliness springs and showers your being. When I hear my little daughter asking the difference between “Lalbagh” and “Landmark” (just because they sounded similar to her), there is Godliness flooded and impregnated in her innocence. When I am walking in the rain and sunshine, suddenly a mammoth rainbow hovers from nowhere and embraces the </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>infinite sky: Godliness just emanated there in sparks, in those </P>
<P>moments. When I see a differently abled person struggling for a meal and find myself moved to tears – Godliness once again surfaced in a very subtle way. </P>
<P>You can hear God sing when birds chirp in the morning; you can hear God roar when you stand near the waves of an ocean hitting the boulders and cutting in–between the solid rock; you can see God stretching his arms and inviting a warm embrace when you see the huge snow–capped mountains; you can witness the energy and dynamism of God in the flowing river; you can feel the wild ecstasy of Godliness when you see the silver moon floating in the black velvet sky; you can see God shimmering when you watch the lovely sunset bathing the sky in crimson–red across the horizon. In deep sleep, without your conscious awareness, Godliness has surfaced of its own accord. Godliness is omnipresent; it is our ignorance that’s stopping us from feeling it. </P>
<P>Godliness is perhaps the simplest in its true nature; the charade of complexity is built out of man’s insecurity. For many centuries, Man has been driving a blind vehicle that neither has a destination nor a track. You just have to keep your identity aside for a minute, just put a mask around all the learning and knowledge you have gained for a minute, just drop all that you think you have achieved for a minute – in this spontaneity and very holistic receptivity you will become the dance of Godliness. </P>
<P>There is no Einstein’s theory or the Big Bang theory or Shankara’s Theory required for this. You just have to look into the mirror without any prejudice – just like a child with simplicity, spontaneity and humility. The mirror escapes and leaves you alone. Bliss! </P>

<H2>So-called Securities are superficial </H2>
<P>ll securities are limited to the extent of ones’ pervasiveness to the situational needs of the material world. You were born out of Freedom, you exist in Wonder and leave in Ecstasy; you own this entire manifestation. Drop all your fears and notions of creating securities for yourself. You are in need of Security only if you are insecure and insecurity is not the nature of existence. Freedom is the nature of existence. When you were born, there was neither Security nor Insecurity; it was just freedom, wonder and ecstasy. When your soul leaves your body to manifest into another, none of your securities is carried with it. It’s the freedom, ecstasy and wonder that you finally carry. </P>
<P>Be brave. Do not get too much attached to possessions. Let life flow like a river. A paper–boat glides swiftly in the currents of a river: the boat by itself neither knows that it’s floating in a river </P>

<P>nor does it get entangled with anything during the journey on the </P>

Existence is like that – it can flow only swiftly like the currents of a river, without an inkling or attachment or bonding to the manifestations of this journey and the odyssey of life that unfolds. </P>
<P>Embrace life. Break the barriers and prejudices you have built all along your superficial life. Empty the cup of your perceptions and conclusions that have corroded your mind. Become a Free Mind. Let your energy penetrate the freedom, let the wonder of existence marry your consciousness. Be a puppet in nature’s lap and glide along the ecstasy and mystery that life unfolds. Then the securities of life will look small. Then life becomes an absolute temple and your being flowers into a prayer. This prayer, this religiousness, this fearlessness and this ecstasy is the need of the hour. </P>

<H2>Black Magic &amp; White Magic stem from the same energy </H2>
<P>ven though the enchanting world of magic continues to bedazzle us, various debates in different dimensions </P>

<P>Through your spirit (energy of your being), you can actually create anything. Even though this sounds absurd at the outset and is debatable (personal to the experience of an individual), it cannot be ignored that through the power of the spirit (energy) one can create things that may appear as miracles to the common man.

Swami Rama’s book “Living With The Himalayan Masters” exposes some of the ‘magic’ of mysterious Mystics, Yogis, Siddhis, fakirs etc. who live in the Himalayan caves for thousands of years and could create miracles out of thin air. Some of these miracles are die–hard experiences that one must be blessed to witness. The book by Paul Brunton “Search Through Secret India” is a similar treatise. Through the book “An Autobiography of a Yogi”, Paramahamsa Yogananda explains how this energy can transmute into the material world and make things seem like miracles for a common man. And remember, these are some of the deep practices in mystic India that have been prevalent for thousands of years (and little or NO evidence exists to either disprove or debate on them). </P>
<P>Anything that you do using this Universal energy which doesn’t harm others is referred to as White Magic (for instance, a Yogi in a Himalayan cave creates a cup of hot steaming fresh coffee from air when Paul Brunton visited him at his ice–cave); Black Magic is the act by which one can cause harm to others by again using the same Universal energy. Swami Rama describes one of the strange incidents he witnessed with a Fakir who miraculously produced sweets out of thin air. These sweets were the same as those in a restaurant hundreds of kilometers away from the Fakir and were what the disciple had desired. Later it was found that all those sweets had been physically moved from that restaurant into the </P>
<P>fakir’s hands by his use of this Universal energy. And this only </P>
<P>(once again proves) that Universal energy (or Godliness) is just an amalgamation of the so–called good and the bad. Both coexist and the duality of existence only proves this again and again. </P>
<P>I must bring some explanation here: there is a misunderstood concept called Witchcraft which is believed to be negative. In reality, Witchcraft emanated from a 5000 year old religious practice (perhaps the oldest traditional practice) called Wicca. Wicca is still practiced widely across many parts of the world and practitioners use this Universal energy to create miracles out of thin air. Wicca worships this universal energy in the form of nature and regards nature (Moon, Sun, Mountains, dancing naked etc.) as a reflection of this energy. Wicca used this Universal energy (even today) to do so–called good deeds. I have read that there were rival religious missionaries wanting to dominate this religion of Wicca and spread the message that “this Universal energy is misused by the Wicca community to harm humanity”. They labelled Wicca rituals as Witchcraft. This false propaganda and negative campaigns by missionaries changed public perception about Wicca and soon the world began to believe that Witchcraft is negative. Even today, the concept is largely linked to Voodoo (black magic using pinpricks and dolls) to the extent that world famous movies such as the Harry Potter series also reinforce this wrong perception (which is very sad). </P>
<P><SPAN>Reiki is also a similar practice – it uses the same Universal energy and transmits positive energy into the human body to cure diseases; it works without the use of any medicine, just through transmitted radiations. The so–called positive effects emanating </SPAN>from elderly blessings (which we traditionally follow in Indian culture) again has its origin in the same root – radiating energy to cause a good effect on the human who is blessed. </P>
<P>Creating so–called mysticism using Universal energy is an exhilarating experience. It requires faith, intuition and an acceptance of manifestation. It then works. I am a strong believer of this practice. </P>

<H2>Your Joy is self-contained through others’ Joy </H2>
<P>ften the human mind is selfish and it takes a bit of courage and attitude to accept this reality. Our identity and the deep attachment we have to the material world (due to our ego) makes us develop a sort of jealousy towards others’ happiness in our subconscious mind. For some it may happen often while for a few others it may happen always; but for most of us it’s sitting in our subconscious mind wihtout our being conscious of it. </P>
<P>For instance, when we see someone who has bought a new fabulous car, instead of rejoicing in the happiness the owner of the new car we try to immediately map ourselves and see whether we have such a luxury in store for us. We may say “congratulations”, but how often does the mind inside not say, </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>“How I wish I had it!” Even though consciously some of us may not be jealous, the Ego rooted in the subconscious mind will emanate selfishness and jealousy in some way. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, we miss the point that our own joy is nothing more than an amalgamation of the joys that overflow in and around us. If you can permeate into the being of the others’ joy, you will be in absolute joy yourself. The point is to feel the expression of joy the other person is undergoing and not try to speculate on what object or subject made him happy. The object and subject of happiness must be kept aside. Then there is a certain transformation you will undergo. You will then begin to see that whenever someone is happy, you are equally happy as well. </P>
<P>This requires a certain practice; the practice of seeing joy in others the way it pulsates in them. We have to go against the natural tide of emotions within us. This can come only through a transformation in your heart, in your attitude to what you daily witness, and through your embrace of Mother Nature. Remember, your joy is not just an outcome of what happens to you alone; it’s an outcome of how you see and perceive what happens to others as well. In fact, most of the time, it’s the latter that often matters more than the former. Unfortunately, man has somewhere forgotten that Happiness is a universal phenomena and not something that is personal (even though it is felt at a personal level). </P>
<P>So the next time you see someone happy become a bit reflective and observe how your own energy levels cause ripples in your happiness level. Take the courage to accept any subconscious </P>
<P>selfishness or jealousy that may naturally creep up. At the outset, </P>
<P>your mind may say you are not selfish or jealous. Allow the mind to relax and reflect. Then come out of the mental box and see things outside of you. See how the joy is overflowing in the happy people around you. Observe the happiness energy and the way it’s penetrating their body and mind. Feel the omnipresence of the divine moment that the other person is experiencing. Swim through this by being a mere witness. Dwell into the being of the person and feel the joy that person is undergoing. Transmute your being into his and float in this sea of happiness. You then are on your own; you are then part of a larger consciousness. You have then merged and melted into oneness with this existence. Then happiness to you can even come through the withering of a blade of grass. Every moment of yours then becomes a celebration of this wonderful, ever dynamic existence we are flowing with. Your being then becomes an offering to this existence and you simply float in blissful ecstasy. </P>
<P>Embrace this wondrous joy that is hidden in others – which is essentially your own. Let’s meditate for a minute on this!!! </P>

<H2>Desires act as a gateway to the ultimate </H2>
<P>esires are not hurdles but the stepping stones of the<SPAN><Sub>D</Sub></SPAN>journey through your life cycle. On the one hand, you cannot avoid Desires and on the other, you should NOT avoid it. Each Desire is an outcome of the myriad of forms your Ego takes after you are born. You need to address them to cross the bridge. You cannot ignore Desires. You cannot repress Desires. Repression will lead to obsession and can transform into adverse effects. Best is to live with your desires, cherish them, and over time become a witness to them. </P>
<P>Even though it may sound that Desires seem contradictory to self–realization, actually it is NOT. Desires are NOT contradictory but absolutely complimentary. Desires form the ladder for you to cross the bridge; each step of this ladder must be trodden upon </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>to reach the abode of divinity. Desires deserve respect and attention but with awareness and witnessing of this energy.</P>
<P> In the Karmic cycle of the Gita, Lord Krishna clearly says that the liberation of the soul can come only when all your desires are quenched through the chain of births and deaths. Your actions from desires will cause the birth and your rebirth will in turn cause actions from desires; this cycle goes on like a rotating wheel until all your desires are fulfilled. </P>
<P>In each life–form, your soul manifests and has its quota of desire to quench, regardless of the form and action. It does not matter whether your soul manifested as a human body (as in this manifestation) or as something which is totally unfathomable. The soul–wheel or cycle–of–life has its self intelligence to quench your desires with every birth (manifestation) in its own form and language regardless of whether in each birth this can be remembered or not. </P>
<P>Jiddu Krishnamoorthy says “you are the world” (desires come and go within the realm of the human body–and–mind). </P>
<P>However, in the preview of Desires, sense–organs or the framework of the body–mind is not the trigger or the house that holds the Desire energy. Desire energy stems from the very soul manifestation and links each of the births that the soul shall move on to in the wheel. There is a spiritual link on the “quantum of desire” between each birth. So there are reflections towards this </P>
<P>– whether this can be transcended, whether this needs to be controlled, whether this is complimentary or contradictory to self– realization and so on. </P>
<P>A desire can be questioned but mere questioning cannot eliminate the identity of the desire. A desire can perish only on two circumstances – one is by living it fully (transcendence) and the other is by contemplation (meditating on it to misidentify from the Ego causing it); the latter is not as easy as said, but the former is human and natural. Karma in Gita goes only purely by the actions performed and each action performed has an impact on the Quantum of desire the soul carries to its next manifestation. </P>
<P>At a broader level, desire is a form of ego and a way the ego transmutes its identity (thereby creating the paradox of duality of life). From this standpoint, how the wheel of life (chain of Births and Deaths) morphs into this desire (ego) getting eventually degenerated is interesting. </P>
<P>Also, in this manifestation, Human Bondage will be the last of the desires to transcend. Sex, wealth, material desires, food etc. all will be transcended before human bondage. Human bondage is the last to evaporate. There is this moment when you will cross human bondage as well (not by control but by transcendence) and you will feel so liberated. You will start to see how the circus happened and how the reality has finally dawned. However, it’s equally important to understand that one may not transcend any of these desires in a particular birth. The transcendence will stagger across successive births based on the maturity of the soul in the wheel of the life cycle and on the karmic effect of one’s thoughts and actions. </P>
<P>It is, therefore, essential to accept desires gracefully, to live them and to cherish them. You must pedal your life cycle to finally become aware (and a witness) of your desire energy. Desires may lead to disappointment in a cycle of life but as you elevate </P>
<P>to a state of awareness and witness and transcend desires, this </P>
<P>disappointment is of no relevance. The journey will only be an absolute benediction, an absolute celebration. </P>
<P>You have then walked through the toughest border; you have broken the hard shell gracefully. Now you can sail!! </P>

<H2>Thirst for Realization is beyond Desire energy </H2>
<P>n a Zen story, a disciple asks his master one of the most inter-<SPAN><Sub>I</Sub></SPAN>esting questions: whether the Seeker of God is also entangled in the web of Desires (since the very seeking is a Desire in itself). </P>
<P>However logical the Question might seem, we must remind ourselves that Desire energy stems from Ego energy and the Ego energy itself is a clinging (warping) to the soul with each manifestation (birth) we undergo. In the wheel of life (that may encompass many Births and Deaths), the fundamental GOAL of life remains that of “freedom”. This freedom is an escape to Godliness, is an escape to your core, is an escape to where you actually reside, and is an escape to your own home, your abode. We must remember that the Ego energy doesn’t create this </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>“freedom”. This “freedom” surfaces of its own accord. The Desire energy which is a by–product of the Ego has no relation to this freedom. One cannot plan or strategize or conquer God due to a Desire. The happening surfaces of its own. When the happening surfaces, you become a witness to it; in fact you realize you were always that and now you witness it. Then the entities “You” and “It” have only one meaning; one unified state. The duality merges and melts into just the state of being one; Convergence alone remains. The “Doer” and the “Done” become one. The “Knower” and the “Known” become one. The “Seeker” and the “Seeked” become one. “You” and “It” become one. In fact you always were “it”. It’s just that now you have awakened from a deep sleep; you have come out of a deep ignorant spiritual hypnosis. </P>
<P>As an analogy, think of how Love comes by. You do not plan to Love someone. You cannot put out a strategy for Love. Love simply happens. Of course, in the case of Love there is the desire energy driving it, but the point to understand is the way Love surfaces. Love just happens and when it happens, you can only be a witness to it. You become it. When in Love, the identities of you and love are lost; Love alone remains. You are Love. The thirst of Realization occurs in a very similar plane; the happening comes by and the thirst comes by regardless of how the Ego or Desire manifests. You are then beyond desires. In fact, the Ego energy gets diluted automatically as you begin this journey leaving behind utter emptiness, naked and absolute! </P>

<H2>The language of success thrives only in the moment </H2>
<P>he word Success perhaps is the most grossly misunderstood word in the field of positive thinking. If you go a bit deeper, a common man’s preview of the word ‘Success’ is just an expectation, a desire of the Ego energy; however, the nature of Success is in the way it is witnessed and accepted. </P>
<P>If Success is a destination, you will never be able to reach it for the simple reason that the Ego once gratified will still search for more success. Ego will involuntarily say, “This is good, but what next?” and the blind chase for success goes on and on endlessly. What we miss is the ecstatic quality of Success – the way it thrives in the very moment, in the very action, in the very journey. Success is NOT an outcome of an action but is the action itself. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>Success is NOT the result of a doing but is the doing itself. Success </P>
<P>is NOT the destination of a journey but is the journey itself. </P>
<P>The Ego energy blinds us so much that we keep searching for happiness in the future (and in the past); we miss all the beauty the journey offered us and persist in casting our desire–telescopes far and wide... ignoring the galaxy of happiness that is bubbling here and now, in the very moment. If you can accept this moment in totality (regardless of what the outcome is the next moment), you have begun the most auspicious step towards Success. If you can become a witness to the infiniteness opened by this very moment, you are sailing in the right boat. Rest follows like clockwork. You are then on the beginning of a new wave, a new consciousness, a new benediction. </P>

<H2>Transcendence of Belonging is an Awakening </H2>
<P>elonging is a beautiful state to be in; it is like Love, like a flower blossoming. The language of belonging can be reciprocated only through the medium of the heart. Even though Belonging is intrinsic to humanity (and is such a humble state to be in), nonetheless, the gravity of belonging by itself will get diluted of its own accord as we begin to move towards our core. </P>
<P>There are times when we live as if we will never die; there is human–belongingness and then there is material–belongingness. As the awakening surfaces, one transcends these. Human– belongingness is the last to get liberated. We go on believing in Securities of life: Security from wealth, Security from assets, Security from family and so on and so forth. If you watch </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>carefully, it is these very securities that generate the insecurity. </P>
<P>Insecurity arises out of Securities and this is one of the mystic life experiences one can discover. </P>
<P>If there is no need to possess and if there is no belonging, then there is no search for Securities – which also means there is no Insecurity. </P>
<P>It must be noted that belonging by itself is neither Good nor Bad; it’s a natural outcome of our desires and desire itself persists because of the ego. This Freedom or Freewill can arise when detachment naturally arises; when you come to realize that you are just a witness of the pure state–with no inkling, no bonding, not even to your close family and friends. This belonging should not be seen with bias. It must be embraced. It must be respected. It must be nurtured. It must be pampered. Then the living happens in totality. Then belonging becomes a joke eventually and will disappear of its own accord. We must witness and meditate (like the child) in this belonging. </P>
<P>Man needs to traverse through the web of this Belongingness. It is through this very Belongingness that man moves into the Zone of Freedom &amp; Freewill. This Freedom or Freewill can arise when detachment naturally arises; when you come to realize that you are just a witness of the pure state – with no inkling, no bonding, not even to your close family and friends. This spark arises eventually and is a very significant milestone in the spiritual odyssey. You are then in just a state of absolute nothingness. You are just a pure infinite mirror – reflecting the ‘mirrorless’! </P>

<H2>‘Security’ is the most disillusioned amongst all Desires </H2>
<P>here is nothing such as Security in its true sense. At the <SPAN><Sub>T</Sub></SPAN>most you may “lease” certain things but someday you will have to forgo the leased assets, including relationships and bondage. Some people think by hoarding wealth they are secure. Some feel secure just because they are married. A few others seem to feel secure because they have children and possession of a house, a car and a dog seem to shower Security for a lot of them. Remember: Life never offers any Security. And it’s not right to call life “insecure” either. Life by itself is neither Secure nor Insecure. Freedom is the way of life. </P>
<P>You can choose certain things as a “lease” and relinquish these when you depart from the station but you cannot create any “security” with it. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>All possessions – including wealth, relationships and bondage – </P>
<P>only “appear” to give a sense of security. How can such possessions generate Security, especially when the possession itself is not eternal? Possessions do not provide security not because these are limited but because life never thrived on security; it simply doesn’t work that way. There is only “freedom” in life, not security. Security is only a temporary lease; so long as you are within the lease–tenure, Security seems to be there but the nature of the so–called securities is only a wave in the ocean. This ocean of freedom has to be understood. Then you can choose or discard everything that comes as waves within the ocean. All possessions then will come as waves of temporary joy and not as securities and so long as the ocean which encapsulates our freedom is in our awareness, the eternal Security unfolds on its own. </P>
<P>The word ‘Security’ then looks like a small fish in the ocean. This is what ecstasy is all about – you live yet you don’t identify; you like, yet you are not bonded; you cherish, yet you don’t possess. This neo–man has to be awakened in you. Then there is eternal joy, freedom and celebration. Life then becomes a beautiful prayer </P>

<P>and Failure are just our definitions to create a so–called “Secure” life. But Life itself is not Secure and nor does life believe in Insecurity. These are man–made divisions that lead to an artificial system. </P>
<P>In birth, there is freedom. In death, there is freedom. This freedom alone thrives. Life doesn’t believe in Security, it believes in Freedom. Life doesn’t live in ambiguity, it lives in Wonder. Success, Failure, Fame, Possessions: all are pseudo–intellectual man–made castles. </P>

<P>When you get into an elevator, you see a couple standing next to you. How much do you care for what they are, where they came from, what they do, why they are in the elevator, are they good or bad, are they successful or failures and so on? We do not care absolutely about anything. Why? This is because your mind knows that within seconds or minutes each one will have to leave the elevator and so do you. You are also aware that after this association in the elevator there is no further connection with these people and one may not meet them again at all. The million dollar question is – when did this great attitude disappear from our life, from our existence? Why can’t we replicate this in our day–to–day life? Where has this delusion of identification surfaced from? How have the yardsticks become totally different in quality and measure – between the elevator and the world outside it? </P>
<P>In the world we live, we are all on a similar elevator – it may be for minutes, days or months or years – but everyone has to finally get off this artificially built elevator. Your so–called success and failures are only some floating shadows within the elevator. You came into the elevator empty–handed and in reality, you will walk out of the elevator empty–handed. Whether you achieve Success or Failure on the elevator or whether you create Fame or Shame on it, the moot point is that in reality one day you will have to walk out completely empty–handed – just the way you stepped onto the elevator of life. The shrine in you, the consciousness in you, and the awareness in you is the only genuine quality your being possesses – the immortal, the eternal, the spirit – and that alone shall prevail whether you are outside or on the elevator. </P>
<P>There is nothing such as Failure in reality. It’s only defined to </P>
<P>the extent of your Insecurity. A perfect Buddha soul reflects a transcendental unperturbed attitude and watches everything that happens in the elevator. It is like looking into a mirror or watching a movie. For such a soul, all that happens is just a Leela, a play. For such a soul, life is only an interim resort; it’s a game of fun, excitement, thrill and grandeur. Today’s man has become a silly fish searching for water in spite of being inside the ocean all his life. Break the barriers, move towards your core and reflect on what you witness; reflect on the fact that you are just pure consciousness. Success &amp; Failure are then mere toys, just a charade, a mask; your being is now bathed in holy thoughts. Let’s witness. Let’s meditate. </P>

<H2>The need for Ego is dialectically paradoxical </H2>
<P>go is one dimension of our life that is absolutely challenging to understand, especially from the viewpoint of our attitude towards it. Many schools of theosophy advise us to stay away from Ego but essentially this is not quite right. </P>
<P>Ego is one thing that is easily misunderstood and easily missed in the larger sense. It may be easy to witness Ego when we are selfish or when we try to fulfil our desires or have expectations from Life. What is challenging is to also be witness to Ego even during the most divine moments – be it doing Charity or Praying to God. Ego is always there so long as you are here in this Universe </P>
<P>– regardless of whether you do anything that is positive or negative. This Ego that is impregnated in all our actions, in our thoughts, in our very breath, and in the duality of our very being must be witnessed and reflected upon. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>It’s important to reflect that the very birth, the very manifestation, and the very reason why you are in this living form is because of your Ego. If there is no Ego, we would not have been born. So long as your being is manifested, Ego is impregnated as part of the existence. The Duality of Existence – God and Ego (Illusion) </P>
<P>– thrives to coexist inherently and inter–dependently, so long as your soul is manifested in this Universe. </P>
<P>It must be recalled that it is through this very Ego, in this very illusionary wold that realization dawns in for us. Ego by itself is neither Good nor Bad so long as it’s just a witness! Ego is like the shell of an egg – for the chicken to survive it needs the shell to protect it for a certain time and it is the very same shell that gets broken into pieces when the chicken comes out alive. Ego is the very same shell we have in us; it cannot be avoided but it has to be transcended for liberation. </P>
<P>To break this shell of Ego, man has wondered, “Where can I find self?” Reflecting on this question, we observe that there is an immediate distinction between “I” and “Self”. There is a fundamental flaw in the nature of the question itself. Let’s reflect: “You” cannot find self. You are it. How can you find “you” as something “outside you”? There is this wondrous charade of having a Universe around our “bodily senses”, but this universe is only as real as a spiritual illusion. Your Body, Mind, Senses, and even your Breath are all perceptions of your identity. They are not you. </P>
<P>Reflect: Where were you all the while when you woke up in the morning from sleep? Where were you in your dreams? Where were you in your deep sleep? Where are you when you are </P>
<P>awake? You are “here and now” in all these states. How can you </P>
<P>“hide” from “yourself” – it’s impossible. How can you say whether Ice and Water are separate? How can you say Air is distinct from Breath? How can we see Waves outside the Ocean? The “projections” were different but the “projector” was the same. The “experiences” may have been different but the “being experienced” was the same. Your axle or the centre has been at par always but the periphery goes on changing. Mirages look dauntingly realistic in a desert but the ignorance is swept away when you reach the point of the Mirage. So the first step is to start the journey inward and nothing can be better than making use of the eternal vehicle of Meditation. Move towards your core </P>
<P>– what you are – and there is definitely the point where the Self shows, Self is and “only self is”. This is not empirical but simply is the reality. The Mirage is real only until you come home. Once you are home, the mirage, the oasis, and the desert all perish of their own accord. The answer for “where is self?” is: it is “everywhere”; it is “here now”; it is “inside and outside” and “you are it”. </P>
<P>One must view Ego that manifests in several dimensions – the Ego that is imbibed in our very birth, the Ego we value for our material so–called self esteem, the Ego we value for our material so–called self–respect, the Ego we value for our so–called ignorance and the Ego we value for our so–called arrogance. Thus, we see Ego jostling between a “Need” and a “Desire” on its own terms. This paradoxical nature of Ego is dialectical and cannot be discounted. </P>

<H2>Birth and Death are merely complimentary states </H2>
<P>eath is the germination of a new Birth and Birth is a culmination of an old Death; these are just complimentary states. Neither state is Good or Bad – they are just dividers in the Wheel of Life. They are just valueless delimiters that surface in the path of the Wheel. They do not have any importance attached to them nor do they have any logic. These are just transient states that intermittently put up a new show every now and then. They help in making Life only more colourful! </P>
<P>Soul (God or Reality) is like a Film Projector and the Movie that we see on the screen is this World (Illusion). The Projector goes on throwing one movie after another on the screen. The Projector by itself has no intelligence; the projector by itself has no purpose; it simply goes on showcasing Movie after a Movie. The beginning of each Movie is the so–called Birth and the ending is the so– </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>called Death. The Projector has no reason for why it casts the movie and the movie by itself has no reason for why it began and ended. </P>
<P>But the point to understand is this – the projector will simply go on projecting movies one after another and the movies simply go on starting and ending until one day the Projector stops working. This is the end of the Wheel. This is Shoonya. This is Godliness. When the Projector stops working, neither the film nor the Projector itself has any identity. Space, Time and matter melt into a state of “Dimensionless Dimension”! </P>
<P>Also, when the Projector is casting the film there could be an intermittent Power Cut during which the Projector hibernates and there is a spark of silence before the Projector starts running again when the Power comes back. This short intermittent silence is what we call the state of susupti, the state of Yoga Nidhra or in other words, the state of “Meditation”, “Enlightenment”, “Consciousness” and so on. At some point in the Wheel, the soul will jostle between this intermittent silence and the movie – again and again – until it finally doesn’t. </P>
<P>Remember – Life is not what happens between Birth and Death but what happens between the “first birth” and the “last death” in the Wheel. Death, therefore, is celebratory. It is a celestial happening because you are only nearing Godliness with every Death. That is why in several communities Death is celebrated with Dancing. It is as divine as the Birth itself. This grace to embrace Death is essential. This beauty of Death has to be witnessed. Then each manifestation (each Birth) is just a movie to watch. Life becomes a temple of bliss and every moment becomes a joyous prayer. </P>

<H2>Happiness is an equation of Simplicity and Balance </H2>
<P>ote that in this context, we can only try and argue for relative–happiness that is material. There is NO MEANING for debate on absolute happiness or the so– called paradise–bliss because there simply isn’t anything such as absolute happiness (other than the state of the very being, the very existence itself). This so–called relative–material–happiness tends to take a path shaped like a bell curve and is experienced when one leads a life of Simplicity and Balance. </P>
<P>Indeed, the words Simplicity and Balance themselves are too abstract and there is no yardstick to evaluate them. However, in my opinion, there are certain immaculate pointers that tend to (remember they only tend to) define a broad meaning to these words and attempt to clear away most of the smoke, but this is still contradictory in itself (in other words, this is only a sort of foolish attempt to redefine happiness). </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>Simplicity is NOT the mindset to create a deliberate lifestyle just </P>
<P>to show–off that one is simple. Wearing slippers or dhoti or sleeping on the floor may NOT be the factors that define Simplicity. Simplicity is really an attitude to draw contentment from what you have. One may be blind while another may be blind and deaf. One may have a bicycle and another a car – neither one speaks of Simplicity unless one draws contentment with what one has. Simplicity is really a way of life. Everyone is in relative happiness and nothing can be more powerful than being self– content. Simplicity is a way of life where one really questions whether it’s worth the stress to chase a castle that is unreachable. </P>
<P>Balance is perhaps more abstract than simplicity. Balance is NOT the mindset that deliberately tries to live in the centre and vanishes from the extremities. Balance is a way of life to neither regret the past nor fantasize about the future. Balance is the way of life one follows to live in the ying–yang of the opposite polarities that life offers to us. Balance is the attitude to embrace all forces that act upon us without the labeling of “Good” or “Bad”. Balance is a way of life in which one lives to cherish the extremities and yet be able to bounce back to the centre just to create the harmony of change. The so–called Balance is neither in the centre nor in the extremities; it lies in the mix of both, in the embracement of both, in the shuffle of both, in the jostling between the two, in the very essence of the changes between the two, and in the very act of balancing between the two! </P>

<H2>Existence thrives in opposite polarities </H2>
<P>ontradiction is the language of existence however unacceptable this may seem. Existence simply cannot live without contradictions and this existence is everything we see, feel and live with or without awareness – inside and outside, in all associations and dimensions (boundless and infinite). </P>
<P>Every polarity has an equal and opposite polarity. Every energy form has an equal and opposite energy form. Every matter has a topology in contradictions: male and female, the good and the evil, the beautiful and the ugly, the saint and the sinner, the divine and Satan, the ebb and the flow and so on. Everything has the soul of duality as its life–form. </P>
<P>The most interesting point to acknowledge is that one has NO meaning without the other and as they live dualistically together, </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>their individuality doesn’t carry a meaning but is a paradox, a </P>
<P>contradiction. Hence, each by itself does not stand out as a well– etched meaning but together they embody a unified dimension. Together they make sense. In comparison one gets defined, in solitude they stand meaningless. </P>
<P>In Taoism they call this ying–yang; in Hinduism, existence is as a fusion of avidhaya and vidhya (illusion and reality in this context) and all honest schools of philosophic thoughts seem to accept this paradoxical nature of existence. </P>
<P>Interestingly, one may even consider the inanimate objects, the so–called non–living things of existence: it is all matter and matter is again made up of atoms. Atoms have this contradiction of protons and electrons – positive and negative energies without which matter cannot exist. Even in the most simplistic events of our life, we can see this trick of duality; we see the roadblock to conclude anything absolutely. We simply cannot conclude anything because of this dualistic hibernating nature of existence in all forms. </P>
<P>Even our breath, our life, our very being, mind, consciousness, Godliness, the very moment (even as I am writing) of infiniteness and timelessness is a warping of Maya and reality – it simply is that way! </P>
<P>This duality is the reality. This flux is the nature. This contradiction is the essence. This paradox is the beauty. This inconsistence is the consistence. This convolution is the language of manifestation. It is in this sheer unfathomable acceptance that divinity speaks. Let’s meditate for a moment. </P>

<H2>Choice breeds Greed </H2>
<P>hen we do not have anything, the so called monkey– mind gets tuned to that. Happiness settles in the </P>
<P>provided bay. The moment choice is there, the monkey in the mind gets charged up. Greed follows. It happens all the time, with or without awareness. In Bangalore, once upon a time, there were just Ambassador &amp; Fiat cars. There was only one type of cheese or safety pin available in the market. Today, with a plethora of brands and choices, the maddening choice has evolved of its own accord.</P>
<P> Choice by itself is not negative; in fact, it creates a perception that it is very positive because then “we can choose the best” and it is in this very statement, in this very invitation that the greed is hidden subconsciously. The rural class and below middle–class </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>get frustrated because they cannot afford to buy the goods that are available to others. This frustration is because of the subconscious greed that germinates with choice as there is a huge variety of the same product. </P>
<P>Take it or leave it – all the goods appear to come with choice and greed follows (like a thread) subconsciously. That, in a nutshell, is what Choice is to us today as a whole! </P>
<P>However, let’s see “freedom” at a different level. We are born in freedom and shall die in freedom. Freedom exists; it’s not a creation. We cannot choose freedom. Freedom is there. It is omnipresent – either we take it or leave it. Regardless of whether there is choice or not, freedom (freewill) will continue to persist eternally. This cannot create greed because this never depended on anything such as choice or variety. This freedom is fundamental to everyone but is outside the realm of greed. It’s simply there – either it’s invisible due to ignorance or is cherished as–is, but there is nothing such as “choice”. </P>
<P>Choice makes the monkey–mind get excited. While one desire is chased and cherished, the monkey–mind still looks for another – especially if there is choice. We see beggars on the streets; they do not have much of greed because they have nothing to lose in life. They have a simple agenda of getting a meal or two in a day. Similarly, a wealthy man (even though he has a house, a car, a good family, lots of money and luxuries) still looks out for more and more. This is because the wealthy man has plenty of choice. He has money and the Ego is continuously pestering and troubling his monkey–mind to do something with the money. Choice naturally becomes a victim of him. This choice breed’s </P>
<P>greed, this choice breeds disappointments. The satisfaction levels </P>
<P>get diluted. Contentment becomes alien. This choice has a cascading effect. </P>
<P>It is, however, imperative to understand that choice by itself is not negative; it is the monkey–mind’s restlessness that is the core problem. Somewhere man has forgotten the differentiation between wants and needs. He thinks every want is a need. These wants are mushrooming every moment because of the abundant choice. Choice plays its tricks subconsciously. For instance, a person who is born blind will not dream of seeing beautiful nature because deep inside him, he has no choice. He has accepted what life offered him. His subconscious mind is conditioned and the monkey–mind rests. But the moment choice is given, man starts building castles in the air. With a little bit of reflection, sensitivity and witnessing, you can overcome the trick of choice. It just requires the quality of seeing things from the outside. Then choice is simply there. It does not bother you. It does not tickle your mind. It simply stays in its place. You then take it only if there is a need; you will then take it as a “want” with the awareness that “it is a want”. Then choice has no connection to greed and the monkey–mind rests in peace. </P>

<H2>There need not be a reason for every happening </H2>
<P>very happening has to have a reason behind it – However <SPAN><Sub>E</Sub></SPAN>logical this may seem, reality is very different. For some of the happenings there need not be a reason. Everything cannot be understood in terms of logical capsules. Everything cannot be philosophized. </P>
<P>For instance, there is no reason for this existence, there is no reason as to why the sunrise looks beautiful or why there is the Wheel of Life. In fact, we should ask, “Why should there be a reason at all for a happening?” Why cannot the happening just be as–is, in an equilibrium beyond any reasoning? </P>
<P>The human mind always likes to rationalize and fails to agree on anything that is illogical; that is the true nature of the human mind. The Ego will not stop at anything less than intellectuality. But existence and life is beyond mind and beyond ego. Existence – the very being, the very moment, the timelessness – has no rules, no </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>logic, no boundary and no definition. Life simply flows on and on. </P>
<P>It simply remains that way, for no reason. Unless the shell is cracked, the reality never dawns. </P>
<P>While the karma theory of Lord Krishna has a cause–and–effect system, the cause–and–effect by itself has no reason, no purpose. In the karmic hypothesis, every effect may have a cause underlying it, however, there is no reason for the cause itself. The happening could be because of past actions (what is referred to as praarabha karma) or the happening could be because of your freewill (which has no bearing absolutely on your past karmic actions). However, neither this praarabha karma nor the freewill by itself has any reason for why the happening is what it is. </P>
<P>There is no reason for acceptance of the innocence in a child. There is no reason for the blissful state of sushupti (dreamless sleep) and there is no reason for the existence of the Wheel of the karmic Lifecycle. The mind is rational and asks, “Why?” Existence does not understand this question nor is existence bothered about this question. Existence simply flows like a river, unperturbed and seamless – with no awareness, no identity, no intellect, no reason. This is why rationality and spirituality never connect – they are concentric circles, they are parallel railway tracks, their grammar is different. The prana of rationality is in a way very different from the prana of spirituality; they are caged in different houses, in different climatic conditions and they speak a different language. Rationality can, at the most, touch your mind and excite your ego but it cannot give you momentum beyond that. Rationality becomes impotent when it confronts existence. Existence is empowering – absolute, total and reasonless. Rationality simply escapes without a trace as it begins to conquer the shores of existence. It cannot knock on the door of existence. It cannot walk through it! </P>
<P>Thus reasons exist only in the realm of the mind, logic and ego. Reasoning has no place in the abode of Godliness. In the abode of Godliness, where you always are and where you always have existed, reasoning is impotent and has no identity! </P>

<H2>Women &amp; Existence mirror each other </H2>
<P>here is a tangible difference in the way a Man thinks and how a woman thinks. A man by default thinks logically </P>
<P>whereas a woman thinks intuitively. A man thinks like an arrow (in straight lines) while a woman’s thoughts follow a zigzag path. A man is like prose while a woman is like poetry. A man is structured and rational while a woman is spontaneous and impulsive. A man is like “growing” while a woman is like a “flowering”. </P>
<P>Godliness has no formula, no logic and no rationale. That is why its richness is preserved – untouched and uncontaminated by society. Existence or Life or God or Truth or Reality is like a Woman – spontaneous, irrational, flowing, intuitive, inconsistent, flowerlike and childlike. It will simply go on without barriers </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>and boundaries, with a river–like flow, nature like tranquility, childlike ecstasy and unbiasedness. </P>
<P>If we reflect deeper on this viewpoint, we will find that both Men and Women are Equal but have opposite energy–polarities. As master Osho commented, remember – they are ‘Equal’ but not ‘Similar’; this is very important to understand. </P>
<P>The Male psyche and the Female psyche is diametrically opposite in energy and thought patterns; this will be reflected in all facets of life including our tastes, emotional–quotient, behavioral–traits (including the sexual behavior), impulses and psychological conditionings. But when one weighs each quantitatively (which is not done empirically for us to understand), they both are Equal in their Power or Qualities, but very dissimilar in traits. </P>
<P>However, it must also be noted that interestingly a male has a feminine part to his psyche and a female has a masculine psyche to hers. The Tantric school of thoughts speaks of this in great detail – of how a Male psyche has the feminine traits and vice versa. That is the reason why it is also scientifically believed that orgasm need not be an outcome of a biological phenomenon and that it can be simulated within the brain itself by exciting the Male psyche and the Feminine psyche in each of us. It is a bit complicated to understand this dual–energy existence within each of us as it works at a very intuitive level and is quite often a bit too esoteric to understand. </P>
<P>Man and Woman are opposite polarities of one human form; together they give a complete meaning to the description of a human being; individually they do not personify the true </P>
<P>meaning of a complete human entity. That is why marriages have </P>
<P>been in vogue for thousands of years now. There is a certain spiritual connection in the meeting of Man and Woman. In Sanskrit, they call this meeting Mithuna. Mithuna is not just a mere physical meeting of male and female; it’s a meeting of the consciousness itself. The symbolic love of Lord Krishna and Radha is personified as an attraction that is beyond physical attraction. To Lord Krishna and Radha, their union was a cosmic Mithuna – beyond the physical intimacy. That is why in Hindu legends the relationship of Lord Krishna and Radha are placed high on the pedestal and revered with folded hands. The ying– yang has a certain vibration that connects to oneness of existence. Even though the attraction between a Man and Woman may sometimes start at a physical level, as they transcend the sexual state their consciousness unfolds. Master Osho’s spontaneous talks in the book Sex to Super consciousness speaks volumes of how the circuit of Sex and Consciousness are connected. Tantric scriptures expound this Man and Woman consciousness, their opposite polarities and their meaning in totality. </P>
<P>Women symbolize the spirit of oneness. Women are templates of Godliness. Women psyche is replete with the attributes of Godliness namely Sat Chit Ananda (the truth, the consciousness and the bliss). Thus, Women are regarded with reverence in Hindu scriptures. Even the panchaboothas are symbolized with womanhood (like Earth is referred to as “mother Earth” and country is referred to as “she”). Even biologically, women are the source of procreation which symbolizes manifestation into this existence. </P>

<H2>The no-reasoning mind is a mirror of true wisdom </H2>
<P>easoning is a roadblock to the awakening of wisdom. It is only in the nascent phases of spirituality does reasoning </P>
<P>look perfect; as the journey unfolds, one will realize that Reasoning and Judgment have no place in the throne of Existence. To see things as they are (and to accept them for what they are) – with no intellectual speculation, with no reasoning, with no bias, with no prejudice, with no judgment – is the greatest Wisdom that can dawn in one’s mind. This is the beginning of a new consciousness. </P>
<P>The mind always wants logical answers. The comprehension of ambiguity and the esoteric nature of existence are unfathomable to the human mind. That is why intellectuals will always remain mere intellectuals – speculating, interrogating, debating, </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>challenging – without realizing that one can never break the barrier of spontaneity and ecstasy which is where existence thrives. </P>
<P>While the quality of inquisitiveness and intellectual speculation is welcome, one must not forget that inquisitiveness can only act as a tool to expose the skeletons of existence; it cannot expose the river–like flow of existence, it cannot compliment the esoteric nature of duality in existence, and it cannot fathom the mystic nature of Godliness. At the most, intellectuality can only answer questions on “How?” The questions centered on “Why?” remain, just like a rock. This barrier can be shattered only by going beyond the plane of rationality. </P>
<P>Allow your being and attitude to accept the way the world is around you, to accept the people as they are and to accept the way life unfolds about you. Do not speculate or reason intellectually. There is absolutely no need for this. This is what the meditation technique Vipassana means. Vipassana means “to see things as they really are”. </P>
<P>A two year old child looks ecstatic on the blossoming of a rose. The child does not understand the colour, the texture, and the biology of procreation. The child has absolutely no awareness of his joy either. He simply accepts the blossoming as it is. For an adult, the same blossoming could have a different impact. The adult might think: “The rose is so beautiful. However, pink is neither my favorite colour nor is the Rose my favorite flower. I must pluck this Rose as it has bloomed. This Rose will fade away soon so I must keep it in water” etc. </P>
<P>Just see the fun and the contrast between how a child feels on </P>
<P>seeing a Rose blossoming as compared to an adult. Though language, society, and education are required for intellectual growth, these can create psychological barriers and make us ignorant. Mind gets corroded with rationality and intellectuality as it grows up to be an adult. See how the child can accept life so spontaneously – there is absolutely no judgment, no prejudice, no categorization, no distinction, and no percussion thinking. For the child, the rose is neither a flower nor anything; for the adult it is “a flower” and the Rose is not his “favorite” flower. For the child, the flower is beyond the comprehension of colour but for the adult “it is pink in colour” and pink is not his favourite colour. Again, for the child it simply does not matter what happens next or how the flower blossomed – there is sheer acceptance of the moment and totality of the joy; the adult, on the other hand, is already worried “that the flower will fade and he has to protect it for the future”. The child is living in the moment, with sheer ecstasy and exuberance overflowing from his self; the adult (through his intellectual / rational / educational speculation) has already lost the moment, the joy. The adult’s mind is already in the future – he even missed the “total acceptance” of the Rose blossoming. This is the joke thrust on us by intellectuality, education and logic – it comes with its adverse stimuli. </P>
<P>So–called Intellectuals spend all their life reasoning “Why this is good”, “Why that is bad” etc. All this is mere stupidity. To embrace life in its multi–dimensional oneness is the greatest blessing for man. Be a child in the lap of nature’s spontaneity. Drop your intellect and float in the ecstasy of existence that you are a part of. Drop all reasoning and become a puppet in the mother’s womb of this wondrous manifestation. Be a tail–less kite gliding in the awe of existence and moving on into a new life at every moment. Become the egoless baby (that you always are but have forgotten) and melt in the mystic flow of Godliness. Awakening begins here! </P>

<H2>Love is an unconditional Prayer </H2>
<P>ove is very unconditional; one cannot strategize and fall in<SPAN><Sub>L</Sub></SPAN>love. One cannot plan to love. One cannot make logical moves in either falling or growing in Love. Love remains absolutely unconditional, impromptu and off the cuff. If it has to happen, it will, come what may. Once you are in Love, you are just a puppet in the hands of the emotional gravity and the escape velocity it pulls you into. </P>
<P>You would have felt this while in love – the Lover and the Loved are separate entities only in the inception. When Love descends, Love alone remains. The identities of the Lover and the Loved melt into one another, emanating a deep prayer – that is beyond language and beyond inference. Some may call this Love genuine and some may label it as infatuation; however, this state is unquestionable and undisputed. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>If one thinks a bit deeper – love is a flowering, an innate osmosis of hearts. In the crescendo one forgets the Lover and the Loved. Love alone remains. In the Tantric school of thought, it’s argued that one loves not the lover but one’s self. In fact, this is a very deep understanding of the situation. The Lover is only used as a subject but as one progresses towards the peak, deep down one ends up loving one’s self without his or her awareness. Deep down, it’s the ego that gets cherished for the lover and fundamentally, it is this subconscious ego that actually instigated the desire to love in the first place. Actually, one loves one’s self and not the other to cherish the ego causing it; the stimulus is from the ego more than in the compassion for the loved one; the Loved is used as a tool to satisfy one’s ego. Esoteric it may seem but this is true of all our actions and thoughts (in general, all actions and thoughts are centered on one’s sleeping serpent of ego), regardless of how cruel a thought this may seem like. </P>
<P>In the abyss of peak–love, love alone remains. The Lover and the Loved have cosmically infused into each other’s being. </P>
<P>Jesus, Krishna, Kabir, Mirabai, Chaitanya prabhu etc. spread the message of Love so compassionately that even today it continues to have a positive influence on us. Love has no language, no grammar. Love is also the language of Ecstasy. Love is the nectar of life upon which it thrives. Let Love pervade. Allow yourself to be loved. Let Love be dissipated. Let Love become your dance of life. Let the tentacles of love spread wide – beyond your Lover and family – let it spread like wildfire onto every human, onto every animal, and onto every piece of matter. Let your being melt with existence. Let the prayer arise and awaken a universal cosmic celebration of Love. </P>

<H2>Learning to Unlearn is the toughest learning </H2>
<P>nlearning – even though it is a very fancy word in today’s times – is one of the most important factors for mental </P>
<P>growth, whether it be for material or spiritual reasons. </P>
<P>The human mind is so biased that we live in a totally programmed world, within a programmed set of Ideals and in a programmed set of ethics we believe to be right; this automatically creates a “psychological definition” of our personality. We tend to believe “this is what I am.” This is the biggest fallacy and the showstopper to our growth. It’s very important to understand that most of what we feel about ourselves is a “psychological bias” we have built over years. The being is absolutely empty in its true nature. The child in us is absolutely the same as it was when we were born. The purity of the mind is still the same as ever. Society, the </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>psychological conditionings and our own bias has over the years </P>
<P>developed a “perception” of our abilities and of our personalities. </P>
<P>This is essentially a cemented–attitude. To Unlearn is the toughest learning because you will have to break all the walls you built, all the so–called foundations you believed in, and all the so–called judgments you were so convinced about. To grow, to evolve and to awaken – this quality of Unlearning is most essential. Man has been trapped in a myriad of illusions about his own understandings, limitations and strengths. To break this, one needs a deep catharsis – the courage to challenge ourselves and the audacity to listen and say, “Yes, I am boundless, with no definition and an open medium”. </P>
<P>It must be reflected that mind is like a lump of clay. You give the shape and it takes it. You make a doll of it, it becomes a doll. You paint it to make it look beautiful. Your mind easily gets influenced, with or without your awareness. Many times we may be assuming that “I am a strong person and I do not get influenced” but this is not true in the absolute sense. Even though one may consciously attempt to ignore the influence, the subconscious mind is already programmed. The subconscious mind is as delicate as it is powerful. This subconscious conditioning, without our conscious awareness, builds a barrier (a periphery) – it builds a fort, a stone fort that goes unnoticed. This is the learning we have amassed over years and years. It’s impossible to dig into this topology that encompasses so much of prejudice and bias. Our conscious actions and our thoughts heavily depend on this cemented conditioning sitting like a coiled serpent in our subconscious mind; we really do not know when this serpent will raise its hood and inject the poison into us. </P>
<P>There must be a way to tap this conditioning, this cemented bias </P>
<P>and to detach one’s self from it. Meditation is the answer. Through meditation, one can become an absolute witness to one’s mind and consciousness; meditation can reveal the mutating negative energies and it can cleanse the subconscious mind. Even hypnotherapy can cure this cemented bias we have developed. Self hypnosis is very powerful – it directly attacks the unconscious conditionings prevailing in us; self hypnosis can awaken our complexes, prejudices, fears and phobias. It is like the Open Sesame effect of Alibaba – it opens the door to the mystic wonder of you. </P>
<P>When this happens, there is a deep catharsis in you – an inner revolution which is a battle with the consciousness; this battle is essential to break all the learning which we have been thinking to be useful. This battle is the diehard effect that is required to unlearn and reach a new dimension of consciousness. This unlearning unfolds life in a billion dimensions and moves you into an orbit of acute wisdom. Keep the Ego aside; drop all your definitions and feel the freedom life has to offer you. Revolutionary it is, Cathartic it is, Ecstatic it is, Celebratory it is and a Benediction it is! </P>

<H2>Identity respect takes the last place </H2>
<P>hy are we so worried about our image (identity)? Why are we so conscious of what Society thinks about us? Why are we living most of our moments for others and not for ourselves? Why is it that most of the “stress accumulated” within one’s self is due to “stress from others” and not “ourselves”? Why the rat–race, the peer–pressure, the domestic– pressure and the corporate–pressure?</P>
<P> In every action and in every thought, our identity is made to preserve its so–called “glory”. This is perhaps the first biggest fallacy of our existence. We go on imagining that such–and–such people expect such–and–such outcomes from us and we are NOT ready to forgo that expectation and proudly say “Don’t expect that from me, I am this”. Everyone wants to be someone and has </P>

<P>someone else! This is the second biggest fallacy of our existence. </P>
<P>I am NOT saying you should be selfish – NO! If your actions and outcomes are a “compromise” to keep someone else happy then it is alright to do so. However, most of our actions and outcomes revolve in concentric circles around the treasures and thrones we have built to preserve our so–called Identity, for our so–called self–respect and to protect our so–called self–esteem: these are just different forms of the same Ego energy! </P>
<P>For once make an attempt to look at yourself in the mirror and accept the true beauty that you have hidden yourself from for decades. Try and see the “Halo” in you which you have forgotten unconsciously from your birth. </P>
<P>Break the Ice. It’s time. Walk Out. Live fully. Live truly. Live with beauty, with wonder and awe. Face life with courage, with humility and love. Let the naturalist in you Awaken and percolate the freshness into your being. </P>

<P>ou do not need to make deliberations in your search for God. In fact, any effort to do this search is absolutely useless. You just have to be a bit receptive. Be more reflective to the life in and around you. Let your intuitive energy open up. Be more natural. By being more aware of life you will see that there is a deep communion with you and the divine – in fact, with you and your inner being. There is a secret echo that subtly whispers that there is bond between you and yourself. </P>
<P>You just have to open your eyes a bit. Just watch the splendour in the myriad Stars and witness the spectacle of the crescent Moon glistening in the night sky. Just watch a kite hesitantly fly in the sky with so much conviction and beauty. Look with awe at a Rainbow hovering for a second and then disappearing in the sky. </P>

If we are receptive, intuitive and natural to our living, divinity will unfold its tentacles and embrace us. The multi– dimensional oneness just stands absolutely bare and naked as we begin this journey. </P>

<P>Only one thing is certain in the Wheel of karmic Life. Between the first Birth and the last Death that your soul manifests into there is one moment when Enlightenment will Dawn. It will surface and transcend into your being. Suddenly there is an eternal spark and you will see that you are it (You were always it) and you are now everywhere (You were always everywhere). You are that – birthless, deathless, timeless and stateless.

<P>Very interestingly, it is the Humans who are the most consciously developed part of this life we witness. Animals are less conscious than humans; they have lesser Bondage and lesser Desires than Humans. Plants are even subtler – they have almost nil– consciousness; yet plants live, they exist. Plants are really in a Stateless State – that is why they look so beautiful and meditative. In fact, if you ask me, other than plants nothing better can be compared with a Meditative State. You just have to watch them to see how blissful they are – no Bondage, No Desires – yet there is a living, a sense of peace, a sense of silence and a sense of bliss. </P>

While the material world is the state with the conscious mind in the foreground and the subconscious mind taking the backseat, the dream world is exactly the opposite. </P>
<P>However, both these are just states of the mind where the material world may “appear” more real but this is just another face of the delusion we witness. In fact, the dream world is perhaps much closer to the self because it’s a pure subconscious state. The subconscious mind is like a thread that can link your previous </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>life to your next life (this belief is of course debatable). Your subconscious mind is an eternal repository of different life–states. </P>
<P>But in reality, all these are mind–games. So long as the mind is alive, these projections will go on. One is a short movie (dreams) while the other is a feature film (awake state). But at the end – both are movies. Both are cast by the same projector (mind) and made by the same filmmaker (soul). One may appear more structured, logical and continuous (material world). All this is a fallacy because the continuity exists for only so long as the mind functions; it’s purely matter and biological, and exists in the realm of the manifestation. One day, both will vanish into thin air and this fact cannot be discounted. The material world may look realistic but it’s only a screensaver – mere soap–bubbles on water. </P>
<P>There is only one thing that must be remembered – the being. That being has not changed, regardless of whether you were a baby or a child or an adult or an old man. The being remains untouched, uncontaminated, unpolluted, detached, non–resilient and stateless. The dream world and the material world are like ice–cubes and frost (temporary) that finally dissolute into their true state – the element of water (H2O) that has always remained the same! </P>

<H2>Meditation is a flowering of the no-mind </H2>
<P>he general perception that Meditation is mere Concentration is a grossly mistaken notion. Meditation has nothing to do with Concentration. In fact, Meditation has everything to do with “No Concentration”. Concentration is mind centric; Meditation is no–mind centric. Concentration is to focus and be fully aware of the state of the mind. Meditation is exactly the opposite – to defocus and be unaware of the mind. Concentration is within the realm of mind. Meditation is beyond the Mind! </P>
<P>However, it must also be noted that it is not concentration but the “Witnessing” that is perhaps the right word – the beginning of Meditation. Concentration requires you to understand the subject, judge the subject and force your mind–energy to fixate on a particular thing. Witnessing, however, does not judge the </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>subject. Witnessing means simply “watching” without making a judgment, without prejudice, without any pull or control from any form of energy. It is just like when you watch something – the sunrise, the flower blossom, the silver–moon, the birds chirping – you simply watch it with awe and wonder. There is no judgment!</P>
<P> Witnessing can happen on anything – it could be your mind, it could be your breath or it could be the sky above you. All one must do is not to concentrate but to simply watch. Simply watch the mind watching. Simply watch the mind getting diverted from watching. Simply watch the mind come back to the same watching after a diversion. Watch this Watching. And you will suddenly see yourself come into contact with your core – your centre, your being.</P>
<P> There is Dynamic Meditation which follows a witnessing after a deep catharsis of Dance and Dirty Shouting. There is Vipassana which witnesses the breath, there is Kundalini which witnesses the energy–centres (Chakras), there is Sky Meditation that witnesses the Sky etc. In all of these you see the seed of “Witnessing”. Once the Seed is sown, your job is done. The plant will grow on its own accord and the flowering will blossom of its own accord. You can only sow the seed (Witnessing) but you cannot control the growth (the flowering of the no–mind). </P>
<P>Witnessing is a practice like music. It is like learning to drive a car – in the beginning it looks almost impossible but by and by, you will get so attuned to it that your consciousness just becomes a poetry of this practice. </P>
<P>In its peak, witnessing takes you to where you are and where you always were – here and now. For the first time, you are home! </P>

<H2>Knowledge is only a toy in the hands of Wisdom </H2>
<P>ll your Knowledge accrues from society, parents and others. Wisdom, on the other hand, is an inner growth. </P>
<P>While knowledge is external–learning, Wisdom is internal–growing. Knowledge is borrowed, Wisdom is cultivated. Knowledge is imbibed, Wisdom is individualistic. All Knowledge can be shared but Wisdom cannot be shared – it can only be experienced. That is the beauty of Wisdom. It’s an inner osmosis; an inner flowering that cannot be stolen away by anyone. </P>
<P>Knowledge can kindle and pamper your ego, but it cannot show you the light of existence. At the most Knowledge can make you Learned (scholar) but it can never make you Wise. Knowledge is only a tool. It is a lever to feel the shadow. Wisdom touches reality directly; it hammers at your very core (your very being). </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>It mushrooms from your very centre. That is why the phrase is </P>
<P>“wise sages” and never “intelligent sages”. Wisdom is a spiritual awakening; wisdom is a spark that ignites the sleeping snakes of Ego; wisdom is the gulf of fire that erupts like a volcano amidst the chaos of ignorance. </P>
<P>All scriptures, holy books and philosophies can at the most shower Knowledge onto you but this knowledge is utter waste. All philosophies are a waste because they reside within the realm of the mind, just good enough to gratify one’s ego. All philosophies are others’ experiences but never your own. There is a certain qualitative difference in the vegetables you buy from the shop and the vegetables you cultivate in your garden. That precisely depicts the taste of Wisdom. </P>
<P>Knowledge is essential only to the extent of triggering certain points of reflection. It can never be the direction or the solution. Knowledge is like the stick to a blind man – it can give you certain security but it can never cure the blindness. The blind man will have to make an attempt to remember where things are intuitively, through his gift of sixth sense and internal perceptions. The blind man will have to make an attempt to create a visual image in his brain system in order to function accurately for a day–to–day living. This visual construction (intuitive science) is what attributes to the blind man’s Wisdom. The stick can only help to some extent but the stick can never create the visual blueprint in the subconscious mind of the blind person. The stick is only a tool – the intuitive study, the experience of the blind man’s movements, the way he cultivates his inner blueprint in his subconscious. Upanishads, Vedas, Koran, Bible, Jesus, Moses, Krishna, Buddha – all are mere sticks like that of the blind man. </P>
<P>You need them but they are not the end to the journey. They are </P>
<P>just pointers – just guidelines and grammatical framework. A Buddha can at the most provide you with a set of alphabets. He cannot create poetry for you. You alone have to write it. </P>
<P>What is really needed is an inner transformation, an opening of a spiritual umbrella, an existential transformation for you to move with or an inner catharsis that is your own. As this inner flower blossoms, you realize the dark alleys you were residing in and you accept that this renovation was essential. Now for the first time you see life with courage because life now looks like a mere joke, like a mirror or a play of some sort. The seriousness has suddenly been dropped. The story has suddenly convoluted to an ending. There is a pulsating awakening. Wisdom is the fruit laden from a tree that is nurtured by your own experience. You are now a new man with a new dimension and a new consciousness. Now, for the first time, you are on the right journey towards the right destination. Now you are awake! </P>

<H2>Dancing is the most cathartic form of relaxation </H2>
<P>here is no other exercise or stress buster that is as cathartic and rejuvenating as Dancing. </P>
<P>In Dance, there is a certain divine quality – the quality of working at the heart–centre. When the Dancing is at its peak, the mind gets disconnected and the heart–centre opens up. If danced in the right rhythm, a deep catharsis surfaces. For this to get transmuted to the being, one must Dance in ecstasy – in wilderness, in absolute shamelessness, in sheer childlikeness, in the lap of nature’s spontaneity, and with no predefined steps. This Dance should simply be thoroughly dirty – with no consciousness or awareness of society, ethics and ideals. Then Dancing becomes a prayer. It is a deep celebration with oneness. It becomes Yoga in itself, percolating the energy–ripples through all the veins, muscles, blood, heart, mind and Soul! </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>If you are engrossed in the Dancing, you might have reflected </P>
<P>that your consciousness has been silenced and the heartbeat has become faster. The more engrossed you are in Dancing, the deeper will be the throbbing sensations in the heart. The mind gets into a hibernating mode while the heart–centre opens up. However, dancing cannot be artificial. It must never be done with preset steps. If the Dancing is done with conscious steps then it becomes an exercise. It’s NOT a Dance. The Dance is complete only when all your inhibitions are shed and flow like a river. Dance is the quality of poetry – intuitive and flowing. Dance is never structured like prose. Dance must mutate your sensations; it must hammer your core and pulsate your being. Only then does a great communion arise – a communion between your being and existence. This communion is a seed to Godliness. It opens a hidden gateway to a new wave meditation. Osho’s Dynamic Meditation gives tremendous respect to Dancing. In fact, Dancing forms an integral part of the whole process of Dynamic Meditation. The Dancing prescribed in Dynamic Meditation is that of absolute shamelessness – a dance that is beyond your mind, Ego and consciousness. The dance in Dynamic Meditation forms a bridge to superconsciousness, a staircase to higher levels of being and leads to a state of perfect equilibrium – of bliss, tranquility and ecstasy. </P>
<P>God is not great but Godliness is. Religion is not important, but Religiousness is. Being Human is not divine, but Humanity is. In the very crescendo of this celebratory dance, one touches all these elements – the Godliness, the Religiousness and the Humanity! </P>

<H2>Humanity never connects to Intellectuality </H2>
<P>here are many traits that Humans display and of these, Laughter and Tears occupy a very special place. This is because Humans are the only animals of this Universe (other than dog and cow), who can laugh and cry (tears associated with emotions). No other animal can do it even it if wants to. </P>
<P>In this context, Laughter and Crying are very divine emotions to exhibit. They erupt out of your being, out of pure compassion, out of sheer simplicity, out of utter innocence and are completely untouched by intellectual forces. </P>
<P>It’s a grave crime to think intellectually when you actually want to Laugh or Cry; it’s a suicidal act to rationalize about your Laugh or the tears that flow out of your eyes. In fact, one must enjoy these states with pure childlike innocence. That is when Laughter </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>has meaning. That is when Tears have meaning. You must accept </P>
<P>them without a mind and live with them in ecstasy. That is when the meaning of the word ‘humanity’ is impregnated in us. </P>
<P>The moment the mind becomes calculative, manipulative, intellectual and rational, the very energy (divinity) of Laughter or tears die. The very thought of speculating on “why the tears?” or “why the smile?” kills the very purpose of existence; in the very inquisitiveness, we end up becoming intellectual fools. People who speculate about Laughter and Tears have become rational idiots. They neither live in the human world nor understand the intellectual world. They are stuck in a hypothetical hypocritical wedge that neither allows them to flow with the divinity nor allows them to merge with the intellectuality. They become useless entities of sheer negative energy. </P>
<P>You cannot plan to Laugh or plan to Cry. It simply doesn’t work that way; that is the innermost beauty and the stark reality of these two emotions. When it has to happen, it simply erupts like a volcano; it awakens like a coiled serpent (that was suppressed for years) raising its hood to the haunting music of a snake– charmer. When it happens, you must not stop it either. Let the Tears flow like a river; let the Tears embrace your being. Let Laughter celebrate its ecstasy. Let your Ego become a puppet for a change in the hands of a human impulse. Keep the mind aside and live those blissful moments. In the very spirit of a natural laugh, in the very energy and the deep abyss of its innocence, you will witness the spark of God! This awakening is a deep transformation and your being melts into the multi–dimensional harmony of existence. There is a spiritual ignition that will glide your being into the warmth of nature’s poetry. This journey can only be a benediction! </P>

<H2>A true intellectual is unaware he is one </H2>
<P>ntellectuality must stem from humility. The moment the mind acknowledges that you are an Intellectual, the very purpose of it is defeated. The ego gets gratified and you get carried away with pride. Most of the so–called intellectuals are actually “pseudo intellectuals” because they not only think they are intellectuals but are also convinced that they really are that. They even try to show– off their intellectualism in their mannerisms, in their attitude, in their very body language, in their very dressing and in their very smile. They will make all attempts to make sure that people call them intellectuals. They are actually not intellectuals but hypocritical fools. They not only try and fool others around them but also end up fooling themselves. They are like the blind mice in a blind race where neither the mice know their destination nor the purpose of the inclination to reach it. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>A true intellectual lives life in its purity – without sophistication, in the total originality of his being, without bothering about his image, name and ego. A true intellectual lives life by the moment, without any bias towards what comes his way. A true intellectual does not even try to understand what an intellectual means; because to him, there is no objective in being an intellectual. Intellectuality is a material awakening that stems from humility, by living life as purely and naturally as possible. For a true intellectual, wisdom dawns of its own accord. For such an individual, it doesn’t matter what the world thinks about himself. Intellectuals truly live life as it comes without any categorization, without any labeling, and without any ideals. For such souls, life is all about freedom. The idea of “Security” or “Insecurity” does not arise. Their self image, esteem etc. become situational in their lives. They never get identified with them. </P>
<P>An intellectual always is in a state of folded hands and bowed head to the wonder life throws at him. His ego does not stop him from embracing life moment–to–moment. He accepts his childlike behavior in completeness and is never embarrassed by the harsh judgment of people around him. You will see that in a true intellectual, wisdom flows seamlessly as if he was born to express it. Even the eyes and smile gleam with radiance in such an individual. In fact, just standing near an intellectual makes you feel the positive vibrations emanating from him. For a sensitive person, the holy Halo can be felt as well when you stand next to such a great soul. </P>
<P>While Intellectuality is a material awakening, Wisdom is the spiritual awakening. Both are complimentary attributes and one fosters the other in their growth. </P>
<P>Intellectuality is not about intelligence, it is about Wisdom. Intellectuality is not about rationality, it is about being intuitive and receptive to nature. Intellectuality is not about speculation, it’s about sheer acceptance of the wonder and awe that existence throws upon us. Intellectuality is not about the mind–centre, it is about the heart–centre. Intellectuality is not about gratifying one’s ego, it’s about transcending it. Lastly, intellectuality is not an outward expression, but an inward osmosis. </P>

<H2>Jealousy stems from Insecurity </H2>
<P>ealousy is an absolute manifestation of Insecurity. Insecurity is a sub–conscious psychological disorder that stems from </P>
<P>Ego. Jealousy is one form of Insecurity, Hatred is another, and Greed is the third. All these are rooted in our subconscious mind essentially because we never took time to reflect on the Ego energy that is creating it. </P>
<P>There is absolutely no need to be jealous of anyone for anything. You are what you are. You are born out of freedom and when your soul departs from the station, it happens with freedom again </P>
<P>– there is no purpose to prove to anyone anything, anytime, ever! </P>
<P>You unnecessarily get worked up looking at what others possess presuming that it’s your destination of happiness (and thus </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>jealousy surfaces). How does it really matter what others possess, </P>
<P>when your own possession is meaningless? What use is this jealousy that doesn’t understand the intrinsic nature of life but just shoots negative energies back? There is no purpose to be rooted in these silly games of the mind and the Ego. These are artificially induced echo–systems emerging out of peer pressure, pseudo esteem and false values we have been unconsciously presuming. </P>

<H2>The subtle difference between Hope and Expectation is in its Attitude </H2>
<P>t may sound too close to differentiate but once the motive behind an Attitude is reflected, one can see a visible contrast </P>
<P>between Hope and Expectation. Both are manifestations of a root desire, but the form is different. Both are driven by the Ego energy. However the impact on each is different. The inner voice of Hope says, “I will be happy if this happens.” However, Expectation says, “I want this to happen!” </P>
<P>An Expectation may sound more positive at the outset but this Attitude is a killer of happiness levels. A Hope, on the other hand, lives in your heart and glides along with your dream. </P>
<P>While an Expectation can give so–called happiness only on tasting success, a Hope will have a normal neutralizing effect regardless </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>of the outcome. An Expectation becomes a liability for your so– </P>
<P>called happiness while a Hope just opens up the possibility of a happiness coming by. An Expectation is very weak since it’s dependent on an event, while a Hope lives on its strength of self– confidence, regardless of the outcome. </P>
<P>The glitch here is that the understanding that Hope is better than Expectation can itself become another Expectation. However, given the awareness, my belief is that the subconscious mind will treat it as a Hope! </P>
<P>Of course, there is a very thin line demarcating the underlying attitude between Hope and Expectation. Someone may go to an Astrologer with the Hope that his problems may get resolved and in this very Hope there is also the element of Expectation. Hence, certain situations have the dualistic form of both Hope and Expectation. Awareness alone can cure this flux and take you to the zone of absolute Hope. The state of absolute Hope is that of living in the moment. This Hope factor subsides of its own accord leading the being to total acceptance of what life has to offer. Hope is a gateway to the abode of Godliness, but such a quality of Hope can arise only by absolute contemplation – by witnessing and meditating. </P>
<P>Hope is something we have to watch and glide with. It’s not like an Expectation that drives us. In Hope, we witness the desire energy rise and fall; in Expectations, we are in a frenzy carried by desire. In Hope, we rise; in Expectation, we seem to rise initially but fall flat eventually. </P>
<P>In the larger context of spiritual evolution, neither Hope nor </P>
<P>Expectation is relevant. They are just forms of Desire energy and somewhere transcendence of both has to happen for the being to merge with Divinity. Hope looks more positive in the materialistic realm. Hope will (at some point) form a ladder to the higher planes and eventually melts while taking us through the successive gateways in the spiritual evolution. The Desire energy that’s mutating the Hope shall at some point in time evaporate because the very characteristic of Desire has a temporary lifetime. It has to leave its shores one day and on that day, neither Hope nor Expectation will make any sense. In fact, there is no awareness of what has transcended when the Desire energy leaves its shores. Such timelessness can happen merely by the power of a meditating spirit. Meditation, as we see it, is the only mantra for the myriad of multi–dimensional paradoxes we encounter. Meditation is the single biggest tonic to all the chronic illusions life throws at us. </P>

<H2>Regret is the most dominant form of negative energy </H2>
<P>here is simply no looking back at life. The past is history and shall always remain as fragments of memory – </P>
<P>nothing more! Decisions and actions might have happened based on certain priorities. So–called mistakes or wrong–doings might have happened with or without one’s freewill. There is no point in regretting past actions for the simple reason that it’s of no use to brood over spilt milk as life has to move on. One may encounter learning or one may mature more by the experience. That is all the take should be. Nothing beyond that! </P>
<P>In the Gita, Lord Krishna explains the subtleties of past actions and how it translates into karmic effects. Even though every cause </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>has to have an effect following it, there need not be a reason for why the cause itself happened in the first place (or why this cause and not some other cause). The idea of freewill also comes into place and destiny jostles between the karmic effects and freewill. Under these revelations and the strange play existence throws upon us, the past is just a part of the whole game we have to witness. The past happened either due to your own karmic effect or due to freewill – in neither case is there anything Good or Bad about it nor any reason for why it happened. The happening is purposeless and the mystery shall eternally thrive. </P>
<P>So regretting the past is utter waste. There is so much to relish from the moment; from our dreams of the present and the future. So drop your fears, insecurities and the shadows of the past and live every moment as it is, here and now. Keep the past aside and glide with life. We have forgotten to make time to relish the moment so where is the time to regret the past? Let’s move on! </P>

<H2>Dreaming is better (and beyond) Achieving </H2>
<P>ne must dream. It is in these dreams we actually cherish our goals, ambitions, passions and fantasies – everything </P>
<P>we desire. The most inspirational quality of Dreams is that it lives in–the–moment; the happiness is carried along the journey of the dreams. The moment you achieve your dreams (or realize you cannot achieve and stop dreaming), your moment of happiness culminates. The happiness you craved for every moment becomes a void. The so–called Monkey–Mind immediately prepares itself for newer targets (newer dreams) because essentially that is where happiness lies. Of course, this does not mean that one should not achieve a dream. However, one must reflect on the happiness that is carried as part of one’s dreams and cherish those moments in totality. The irony is that most of humanity misses the joy of dreams and is always focused </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>on “achieving” the dreams alone. Dreaming is a way beyond </P>
<P>achieving! </P>
<P>There is something to actually reflect on in the “expectation” part of your dreams. It’s true that the conscious mind will have expectations. After all, that is the motive for dreaming and the driver of our Ego. However, if you live your dreams in totality by embracing every moment of the joy it spreads, “achieving the dreams” becomes immaterial. The ego and the conscious mind become impotent in front of the mountainous joy you would have accumulated through the journey of dreams. The net effect is, you will be surprised that your being is hardly affected by what the result is! Even though this is not as easy as said, the fact remains that expectations will melt in front of the true power of living one’s dreams. </P>
<P>In a movie, I can recall that a child dreams (while in sleep) of a beautiful pearl hidden inside the sea–shell on a seashore. In the morning, the child gets up and runs towards the sea–shore (in sheer anxiety). The child is running with excitement to discover if there really is such a magical pearl hidden in a sea–shell on the sea–shore. After running miles, the child comes to the sea–shore and discovers to his surprise that indeed there is a sea–shell. The child jumps onto the sea–shell and with thrill and throbbing excitement, opens the sea–shell to only discover that the magical pearl was not there. The child gets terribly disappointed. The point to note here is, so long as the child dreamt of the magic pearl and was running towards the sea–shore with excitement, he was brimming with happiness, ecstasy and the ultimate joy of living in the moment. Unfortunately, the child did not reflect on that journey of happiness. The child was only thinking about the results, the destination, and the dreamt fantasy. The child’s anxiety was caused by his expecting that the pearl might be really there. Thus the child is shattered when he discovers that the dream was nothing more than an illusion. As the charade of the dream ends, the child is very disturbed, disappointed and shaken. This is the same plight every common man suffers from. The child never reflected on the hidden joy (from the dream) when he woke up in the morning nor did he witness the momentary happiness that glided with him on the journey towards the sea– shore. In fact, to make it more clear – even if the child had found the pearl, the happiness would have culminated because the child never enjoyed the greater contentment from the journey itself. </P>
<P>The subtlety lies in the fact that the mind cannot rest without creating newer targets because it never enjoyed the journey in totality. All through the journey, the mind only thinks of results and expectations from ultimate destinations. It forgets the joy of being part of the very ride to reach there. Once this art of witnessing the totality of journey is mastered, the game becomes a simple toy. The game may still go on, but your being remains unaffected. I agree that this is easier said than done and there is no logical formula to achieve the same. But with awareness, the practice comes by naturally and leads to a zone of zero tolerance. </P>

<H2>Faith need not be consistent always </H2>
<P>aith is a very powerful word. It’s pure “religiousness”.<SPAN><Sub>F</Sub></SPAN>Remember, as master Osho says, Religiousness is nothing to do with the so–called Religion. While Religion is a pre– conceived doctrine, Religiousness is following a faith with spontaneity. It’s a natural embracement with no categorization and no rationalization. While Religion is someone else’s, religiousness is purely yours. Faith is all about Religiousness and has nothing to do with Religion. However, it could so happen that your religiousness may align to a particular religion but such religiousness is bound by faith and not belief. </P>
<P>Again, there is a fundamental difference between Faith and Belief, and this is very important to understand. While Belief is driven by rationale, Faith is driven by intuition. While Belief relies on certain facts, evidence, logic etc., Faith has no rules or grammar </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>to base itself upon and just springs of its own accord. Belief is </P>
<P>the cultivated outcome based on historical facts/events/ observations whereas Faith stems spontaneously and it can be a spark, an awakening or an inner wisdom that sprouts. Beliefs can have a flavor of the “benefit of doubt”, but never does Faith. Belief is more on a rational and intellectual plane while Faith is more on the intuitive and irrational plane. Belief is given to you by society, by observation, by speculation, by inference, by logic, by assessment, by analysis and so on. Faith is inborn, home– grown, cultivated and nurtured by your being. Belief neither comes with your Birth nor is it carried away with your Death. Faith comes with your birth and carries its spirit to the next birth as well. Beliefs are situational and conditional whereas faith is involuntary and unconditional. </P>
<P>Faith in itself is not a static phenomenon. Man’s faith may go on changing; it may be very different ten years from now to what it is today. But the point is that his faith is a phenomenon of totality at any point of time. If it is constant, you just witness it. If it changes, you again just witness the change. There is no room for debate. It’s an existential continuum and can take its form in any way as we evolve through the Wheel of Life! Faith can be as true as that moment and will take its shape according to the situation. Faith is sheer surrendering – regardless of whether it is about following principles or praying in a temple or simply not following anything (being an atheist). This faith is a backdrop of our consciousness. It will tell us what our inner instinct is and it’s wise to follow it. </P>
<P>No other Guru is essential so long as one’s Faith has emerged from one’s purity and spontaneity. Just follow these God–sent pugmarks. You will reach home! </P>

<H2>Being childlike is the greatest human trait </H2>
<P>s we grow – somewhere around 4 years – we start losing our innocence, our childlike attitude towards life. Mind starts getting corroded with reasoning, with society, and with parental teachings of Dos and Don’ts. The flower–like spontaneity that we exhibited gradually fades away and we tend to become so called Rationalists or Intellectuals or to put it simply, Adults. This is perhaps the saddest transformation in human life. The childlike spirit is not only lost but also grossly forgotten forever. </P>
<P>As master Osho says in one of his commentaries – being “Childlike” is very different from being “Childish”. Being childlike is living in absolute bliss, with a totality of freedom in all dimensions. It is like the attitude of a new born child and is </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>as natural as a flower that blossoms or the Sun rising in the sky. </P>
<P>This is the single biggest human trait one can achieve. </P>
<P>It is worth an attempt to reflect and to revive the child in you – the feeling of living in totality with no categorization, no rationalization, no Good or Bad, no Right or Wrong, and no Ying or Yang. In fact live a NO NOTHING – just live in spontaneity, in acute exuberance, and in the very roots of innocence where body and mind merge with the being. </P>
<P>As adults we always start doing something with speculation and reasoning; mind is always biased for adults. In children, there is spontaneity, innocence, ignorance and the quality of “seeing things as they are”. There is no embarrassment in children and they speak from their heart as the heart–centre is more active in children than in adults. The subconscious mind is much purer and active in children than in adults. The room for the mind to get corroded is lesser as they are yet to get exposed to society. This is precisely the reason why being childlike looks so beautiful. It has that innate presence of Godliness. No wonder children are compared to Gods. </P>
<P>We adults are also responsible for the child losing his/her quality of being childlike. Every adult / parent in the society wants his/ her child to be the best. In this blind rat race and unwarranted peer pressure, children are treated like adults; we pressurize them and expect them to be someone other than themselves. We have curbed their freedom right from their childhood. We never allow children to be children because of our self esteem, egos and peer pressures. This is grossly wrong and humanly not correct. Rather than learning from children the quality of their ecstasy, we instead start teaching them and overruling them which is essentially a suicidal act. It is said that children are capable of asking 400 </P>
<P>questions in a day if you allow them to ask but we, as parents / </P>
<P>adults, cannot tolerate a single question. The moment a question is asked we ask the child to keep quiet and further de–motivate them by saying they are still small and have to grow up to understand. We never appreciate their inquisitiveness nor do we attempt to see it in the right perspective. The failure is ours and not of the child. Since we lack the creativity to answer the question and encourage the child’s perspective, we suppress the child and build a complex that “this is bad, you should not ask” etc. </P>
<P>It is necessary to give the child many things – society, parental guidance and direction, education, ethical systems, tradition, culture etc. but it must not be forgotten to allow life to flow and encourage the ecstasy in children. In the fray of Insecurities, we as adults must not take away the childlike quality of children. If its learning, I see more of the adult to learn from children than the vice–a–versa. </P>
<P>Let’s go home and make a beginning by folding our hands to our little children! Peace! </P>

<H2>Humility is a great catalyst for a meditative-mind </H2>
<P>meditative mind requires the Ego to be dropped. A certain quality of receptivity, acceptance, and silence is required and these stem from humility. Humility opens up all possibilities and mysteries of existence. In fact when humility arises, Ego disappears of its own accord. </P>
<P>A small speck of Ego can cloud the very osmosis of meditation. Just a passing thought – “I can meditate” – is enough to create chaos in our minds and obscure the real power of meditation. A momentary feeling – “now I am meditating” – is enough to disturb the bliss and bring you back to this illusionary world. Even a subtle thought – “I am now getting into the trance slowly” </P>
<P>– is enough to shake the screen–saver and bring your awareness back to this chaotic world. </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>Humility is a great weapon. It stems from openness, in sheer acceptance, in being utterly silent and watchful of life, and lies in the very energy of simply witnessing without any categorization. This quality of humility is enough to catapult our being into the state in which we always were, always are! </P>
<P>The first principle is to keep Expectations aside and this is not an easy challenge. The human mind is so much attuned to expecting results that even before one starts meditating, the subconscious mind is already excited to see if something miraculous is happening. This is the precise reason why many cannot achieve the ideal state of meditation. It requires plenty of inner reflection and one has to take “one step at a time”. Meditation is a flowering and the entire genesis has to take place before the trance sets in; and for that, humility is most essential. Drop the thought of becoming ‘somebody’ by meditating. People have a built–in preconceived notion that “we become elevated souls” when they begin to meditate. Drop all these fallacies and enter the meditative spirit with an openness to explore its wonder and mystery. </P>
<P>You are not going to become ‘somebody’ by meditating. In fact, you will be a ‘nobody’ if everything goes well as expected. This state of being a ‘nobody’ is also the effect of becoming ‘everybody’. </P>
<P>Remember – Meditation will only take away the unwanted and leave behind what is wanted. It does not create anything new. A sculptor removes the unwanted layers of a rock to carve out the sculpted idol. He believes the idol was always there. He just chiseled away the unwanted fragments in the rock to get the idol that was always there. The sculptor never created anything new. He was just a good craftsman and had the eye to penetrate into the rock to get what he wanted. Meditation is very similar. It does not create anything new – it just takes away the foreign </P>
<P>bodies we have accumulated leaving behind the inner core which </P>
<P>we always are, which we always were and which we will always be. </P>
<P>Humility leads to the very genesis of a new transformation of life. In its purity, humility becomes an ocean melting all our identities. Societies cease to exist, ideals and philosophies disappear. Consciousness and identity evaporate leaving behind only a state of absolute nothingness, utterly empty! In fact, as you begin this journey, you will encounter at every moment of your being the heavy baggage of Ego it is carrying. As you practice this and become a witness, your heavy baggage of Ego automatically disappears. Even the awareness that “I am no more the Ego” cannot be comprehended, since the mind is completely at peace, and your being stands naked and absolutely truthful. Bliss! </P>

<H2>Mind is a stoned hypothesized framework </H2>
<P>ost times, it’s a perception that Mind is thinking logically.<SPAN><Sub>M</Sub></SPAN>We assume we are being “rational”. In reality, most of the time, we are thinking through a framework of the mind that is already biased, conditioned, prejudiced, corroded and pre–packaged with Hypothesized conclusions. </P>
<P>For instance, we may see a person is being chased by a set of (presumably) hooligans. Immediately the mind starts to clamor with sporadic chatter: the mind will tell you “the person being chased is innocent”, “the gang chasing him are bad people”, “the act of chasing an innocent person is bad” etc. After a few months, you may see that person who was chased. Your subconscious mind has already registered that “he is a good person” etc. regardless of whether (in reality) he was really Good or Bad. We </P>
<P>Shoonya-final layout.pmd </P>
<P>may not even realize that there were so many assumptions and hypotheses in our mind. Also we did not even try to find out why he was being chased in the first place. This is the typical manner in which Human Mind functions: it doesn’t realize how prejudices, biases and conditioning get imprinted in its deep layers. In Freudian psychology it’s argued that it is actually the “unconscious mind” that gets deeply conditioned and has many psychological inhibitions and implicit assumptions based on how the subconscious mind is continuously brushed and conditioned. </P>
<P>In fact, whenever we see things, we are already biased without our awareness. For instance, we see a sunset and instantly the mind chatters, “Lovely sunset!” In reality, upon deep reflection, one may realize that the sunset is just by itself and the word ‘lovely’ was a “thought knowledge”; every moment we might have grown up hearing that “nature is beautiful”, “sunset is so pleasing” etc. that it would have conditioned the mind in multiple dimensions. I am not saying this does not mean one does not like the Sunset when one sees it. All that I am saying is, the magnitude and the gravity of thoughts / feelings that impulsively come to mind are at most times prejudiced. </P>
<P>We always think through a “conditioned framework” and do not realize that this framework itself was an outcome of multiple hypotheses, conditioning, education, society, parents and contemplations. </P>
<P>In Zen, that is why the entire movement is towards being a witness to the Mind and dropping it eventually. Zen believes that the Mind is the barrier to consciousness and the ultimate will unfold itself as we wipe off this rocky layer of the Human Mind. </P>
<P>Human Mind is stoned, drugged and hypnotized even when it is in its scientific conscious state (awakened state). We assume that the Mind is Open &amp; Clear, but the Mind is often closed and stoned with multiple conditioning and works only through the “conditioned framework” by default. We do not realize how dangerous this is because we are assuming we are on the right track even as we glide away from reality. It is like a mirage – we may go on assuming it’s an oasis, until we fall into the pit. </P>
<P>Mind is a screensaver, it’s a charade, it’s the “perceptive container of the Universe”, and it is the reservoir of “our sensations and feelings” contained within the “conditioned framework”. This prejudice goes on building exponentially in us and becomes a coiled serpent sleeping in our subconscious mind. You never know when and how this esoteric snake will raise its hood and inject the poison. A deep witness is essential; a deep meditation is required to break the thick layer and penetrate the consciousness that will reveal the oases to be mere mirages; it will unfold the reality that all the snakes we visualized were mere ropes dancing to the breeze in semi–darkness. </P>
<P>Let’s wake up! </P>
