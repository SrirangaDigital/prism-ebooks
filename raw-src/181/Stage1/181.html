Since the rubber industry was in trouble, he decided to join coffee planting with Consolidated Coffee Estates in 1929. In 1936, Mr. Bull was appointed General Manager to take over the affairs of the company in India. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>In an article, Mr. Bull recalled the traumatic situation brought about by the war: “The Second World War brought another period of great anxiety to planters. At that time I was the Chairman of the Coffee Section of the UPASI, and with memories of earlier days in Australia, I wrote to Mr. Howie, the then Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, who had been a neighbour in South Australia, some 20 years previously. I was aware that these growers had evolved a scheme many years ago, by which an artificial higher price in the Australian market was averaged with the actual realisations on exports which were lower. All produce was graded to fixed standards and pooled for sale at home and abroad.” </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-right:38px; margin-left:0px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>“In the result, growers received a fair price for their fruit. Mr. Howie’s response was immediate and enthusiastic. He sent over all literature regarding their own organisation and also his own views. With the loss of our export markets, it appeared as if we might have to rely on a similar scheme for coffee. The UPASI, carefully studied everything which had been sent and adjusted the Australian scheme to suit our own industry. Our proposals were forwarded to the Government of India as the UPASI recommendations for dealing with the situation.” </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-right:38px; margin-left:0px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>“The proposals were not adopted by the UPASI without opposition, and I still have vivid memories of a frustrating meeting with the curers at Mangalore.” </SPAN

<P style="margin-right:38px; margin-left:0px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>“In Delhi, Sir Frederick James who held the European seat in the Legislature was very helpful, and eventually identical proposals came back to South India for discussion at a coffee conference, with the added prestige of being the government’s own recommendations.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>Since the world market could not indicate a price, Mr. Bull did much to persuade the Government to depute somebody to study and recommend a price for coffee. S.L. Cook, the chief cost accounts officer of the finance department, was deputed to undertake the cost study in 1944. Thereafter, the costing of coffee was to become a periodic exercise for nearly 50 years. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>Mr. Bull was keen on research and provided facilities for Wilson Mayne’s early work in coffee. He was instrumental in the leasing of UPASI’s experimental farm in Balehonnur to Leslie Coleman’s Coffee Research Station, which is now under the Coffee Board. Wilson Mayne was a close friend of Mr. Bull’s. When the pooled marketing system was being moved through UPASI, Mayne was serving as the UPASI Secretary and Mr. Bull worked closely through him. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>However, the Coffee Amendment Bill, 1952, moved in the Parliament by the newly formed government was not to the liking of Mr. Bull and it was said that this had something to do with his decision to retire from India in 1954 and return to farming in England. * </SPAN

<P style="margin-left:38px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>The former chairman of the Coorg Planters Association, Mr. K.P. Uthappa recalls an incident that shows the affection that Mr. Bull had for the people of India. “I first saw Mr. Ivor Bull in August, 1942, when the Quit India movement was launched. A large group of high school students from Virajpet came to our school in Pollibetta in Coorg, collected us and marched up to the head office of the Consolidated Coffee Estates Ltd., and started shouting patriotic slogans. Mr. Bull came out of the office and talked with the leaders. Our leaders offered him a ‘Gandhi cap’ which was a red rag, as it were, to the British. Mr. Bull smilingly put the same on his head and we all clapped.” </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:38px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>From the beginning, Mr. Bull had taken to Coorg and its people with an instinctive insight and warmth which remained with him for the rest of his life. He was an austere man with a formidable forehead and a scarred cheek. His war-time injuries made him somewhat stiff and straight. He had a keen sense of humour. </SPAN

>It is well established that coffee drinking originated in Arabia. The popular legend of how a goatherd named Kaldi in Abyssinia found his goats happily dancing and prancing one evening after eating the coffee berries is the oldest reference to this beverage. The goatherd brought this phenomenon to the notice of a mufti who experimented with the berries and made a brew using the beans. The mufti who had a problem of falling asleep during his prayers now found himself exhilarated and able to keep awake longer. His seminary came to be known as the ‘wakeful monastery’. This news soon spread, and the concoction gained popularity in the Muslim seminaries in the neighbourhood. </SPAN

<P style="margin-left:0px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

><SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

Most of those in Muslim seminaries in Arabia used to conduct their religious discourses in the evenings to avoid the blistering heat during daytime. Drinking Kohwah kept them alert and awake late into the night. By the end of the fifteenth century, coffee drinking spread to Mecca, Medina and Cairo. It was only a matter of time before the </SPAN

>mosques and a section of the rigid clergy started arguing against the beverage. They equated coffee drinking to consumption of wine which was strictly prohibited. Around 1511, the governor of Mecca banned the use of coffee and shut down all the coffee houses. However, the governor’s ‘indiscreet zeal’ was disapproved of by his lord and master: the Sultan of Egypt. Coffee houses were reopened, but many activities such as gambling, singing, and dancing were forbidden. </SPAN

People of Constantinople took to the drink and the concept of coffee houses was elevated to a higher level. Kaveh Kanes became like clubs where like minded people could drink coffee and indulge in recreational conversation. In some of the coffee houses in Damascus there were orators who were hired to tell stories – ‘Thousand and One Nights’ being the favourite.

They called the beverage ‘Cavee’ and it became trendy in Venice. With coffee becoming increasingly popular in Rome, it came under criticism by the clergy who denounced it as an invention of Satan! Pope Clement VIII was approached by the priests to prohibit the consumption of what they called the ‘Devil’s Drink’ by Christians. The priests further informed the Pope that the drink was being introduced by the infidels to entice Christians to fall into a trap set by Satan. </SPAN

The Pope found the aroma so pleasant and inviting that he was tempted to taste the drink. After drinking it he exclaimed: ‘Why, this Satan’s drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We shall fool the Satan by baptising it, and making it a truly Christian beverage.’ To the astonishment of the priests, Pope Clement VIII ceremoniously baptised coffee and proclaimed it as a truly ‘Christian beverage’. This papal act gave a strong fillip to coffee and its popularity started spreading all over Europe. </SPAN

They vastly improved upon the concept of coffee houses. European coffee houses attracted all classes of people.

There were also adverse propaganda and attacks on coffee by the pub and ale-house keepers who found their business being usurped by the coffee houses.

There were several philosophers, writers, and artists who had their own favourite coffee house and anyone wanting to meet these gentlemen could do so at their most preferred haunts. There were animated discussions but unlike in the pubs and ale houses none were intoxicated. In Austria, some of the regulars such as psychologist Sigmund Freud had the name and address of their coffee houses printed on their letterheads. </SPAN

>It was in eighties (1880s) that I came out to Coorg (Kodagu) for a visit and stayed for fifty years. Life in a coffee district in those days differed widely from that in towns and gay hill stations which offered a constant variety of amusements. Here, Europeans were sparse and widely scattered, and often a distance of twenty or thirty miles intervened between estates and European neighbours. </SPAN

>Upon first coming out, therefore, a woman was apt to find life more than a little dull, especially if she had been brought up in a town. But she soon got used to changed conditions, and settled down quite contentedly to the quiet lot of a planter’s wife. The state of the crops, the aspect of the clouds, the conditions of coolie labour, and other matters incidental to coffee planting would gradually assume for her an all-absorbing interest, and in a year’s time she would probably wonder how any other life could have held any charms for her. </SPAN

>On a coffee estate, the day began early. At six-thirty, one was wakened by the clanging of the estate bell, which summoned coolies to muster-roll before starting their day’s work. At the same hour, the early cup of tea materialised for the dorai and doraisanny (Master and Mistress). Then at seven, out on the verandah, chota hazri – a substantial meal of porridge, eggs and bacon, coffee and fruit. For the dorai there came the morning round on the estate. For his wife the walk, or ride, before engaging in the usual household routine, such as the ordering of meals, the weighing-out of all the commodities required for the day, seeing that the drinking water was boiled, and, by using a lactometer, finding out that the milk had not been watered, and so on. </SPAN

This is explained by the fact that a native of Skye was one of the early pioneers of coffee in South India. Through his influence, many Highland boys gravitated to Coorg, where they found careers as planters. When sufficiently </SPAN

These included dinners and dances, tennis tournaments and gymkhanas, race meetings and early morning riding picnics. As all this went on mostly without a break, we used to arrive back on the estate exhausted wrecks. It was, however, a wonderful change, and made up for many dull days throughout the year.

>And then, a party given by Harry Graham to usher in the New Year stands out in my memory. Harry was a well-to-do bachelor who liked entertaining and who prided himself on doing things in better style than anyone else in the district. If a dinner is to be judged by the profusion of its courses, the splendid repasts at which we periodically assisted always excelled in this respect. Harry, being a Scot, was rather economical of speech, and we always figured at those symposiums because George, who never knew when to stop talking, was counted on to keep things going and talk agreeably to the ladies. </SPAN

>In our district, my husband had a wholly exaggerated reputation as a witty conversationalist, which made him a welcome guest at any dinner table. Shortly after our marriage, I came to realise my own complete insignificance in the general scheme of things, and when we were asked to parties I knew full well that it was not owing to my own personal worth or charm, but because George could keep a dinner table interested and amused with a great deal of nonsense. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>On this occasion, we were told that oysters from the West Coast, sixty miles distant, were to be the chief item on the menu, and as there was no railway, coolie-runners were to be posted every five miles to ensure that the delicacies should arrive in a perfectly fresh condition. Humble people like ourselves had to be content with things out of a tin, presented in the guise of “oyster fatties” or “oyster escallops”, but to Harry, who was prosperous, expense was no object. </SPAN

>We had a ride of eight miles to negotiate, and I remember I was strangely attired in a black lace evening dress covered with a riding apron, and a moth-eaten fur cape. This was to avoid the fag of changing, and bachelors’ bungalows in those days were rather deficient in bedroom appointments. But George elected to send his evening kit -which was packed in a flat tin box -on ahead. In Harry’s spare bedroom I was engaged in adjusting my hair in front of an inadequate glass with an eruption of black spots, which had an annoying habit of swinging round and hitting me on the face, when I heard a blast of lurid language issuing from the adjoining dressing room. On investigation, I found George in his shirt sleeves contemplating with horror the bodice of a pink satin evening dress, which he presently rolled into a tight ball and flung into the furthermost corner of the room. Other articles of female attire, such as a frilly petticoat, shoes and silk stockings received the same drastic treatment. I recognised the pink satin as the property of Mrs. Brown Jones whom I knew was due to dine at a bungalow eight miles away. The obvious solution was that our respective coolies had foregathered at a wayside arrack shop, and that in the darkness the boxes had got mixed up, for after all one flat tin box -the usual receptacle in those days for carrying clothes -was much like another. Although not naturally vindictive, the thought of Mrs. Brown Jones having to sit down to dinner in a tweed riding habit, amidst an assemblage of </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>pretty frocks, did not excite my sympathy, for a month before she had not only bribed away my cook with the offer of bigger wages, but had by the same ignoble means lured away the only coolie on the premises who had the intelligence to comprehend the eccentricities of my Tamil. George, to his great annoyance, had to dine in his riding kit, as he was unable to borrow any garments from Harry who was of much shorter build. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-left:38px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>We all sat down expectantly to enjoy fresh oysters straight from the coast of Malabar. But the advent of the soup crushed our hopes, and we concluded that the coolies had not run fast enough. When Harry’s enquiries in an agitated whisper elicited the reply, “Please, sar, cook done make into oyster fatties”, our host sank back in his chair bereft of speech, and an apoplectic fit seemed imminent, while we ate our “fatties”, which we could have got at our own dinner tables any day of the week, with the contempt born of familiarity. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>During the next course, a collision occurred between two of the boys, resulting in the floor being decorated with foie gras in aspic and fragments of crockery. This time, Harry uttered a stream of horrible language under his breath. The foie gras, having been retrieved by the hands of native boys and presented to us, was not unnaturally declined by all, excepting George who, engaged in fluent conversation, remained undisturbed by the fact that he partook of food liberally coated with dust. The turkey was half raw, the curacoa soufflé watery, and the angels on horseback uneatable. It was clear on the face of it that Harry’s cook, who was really an excellent servant, had been “celebrating”, and I knew he would be summarily dealt with on the morrow. </SPAN

>After dinner, George excelled himself. He sang five comic songs and, to the music of Mac’s bagpipes – played out on the terrace – he gave an exhibition of his own special interpretation of the sword dance, prancing round a carving knife and fork crossed like swords. In short, he monopolised the whole evening. At twelve o’clock the rum punch circulated, healths were drunk, and Auld Lang Syne sung with fervour. Soon afterwards we rode out into the night amidst a chorus of “Happy New Years”. At parting, our host wrung George’s hand and said he had been the life and soul of the evening, to which George replied modestly, “Do not mention it, old chappie”. </SPAN

Out of pure goodness of heart, George drove out in his dogcart fifteen miles of the way to meet her. It will be an agreeable change after miles of jolting in a crawling cow carriage, he had said amiably that morning. But when I saw him tearing down the drive at a furious pace, Kitty, who was fresh and skittish, having done a little preliminary waltzing among my flower-beds, I was seized with misgivings as to the success of the enterprise. George was an utterly reckless driver, and truth compels me to state that the occasions on which I trusted myself to his care were fraught with such painful memories that, latterly, I preferred to take my drives abroad in a more safe, if less dashing, bullock vehicle. </SPAN

>They were expected by tea-time. Long before that hour, however, I beheld Kitty galloping merrily up our drive, with fragments of George’s cherished dogcart dangling behind. By the time the grass-cutter had extricated the animal, Hussein the syce, breathless with much running, arrived and put me in possession of details. When passing a native village, the horse had shied at the sound of tom-toms, and the Sahib, being unprepared, she got out of hand and bolted. Rounding a corner, they were all three pitched out and Kitty galloped home. No one was hurt and the Sahib was able to engage a bandy (country cart) to bring the Mem Sahib home. Hussein’s report prepared me for the melancholy procession which, about an hour later, wended its way at a snail’s pace up our drive. Aunt Eliza, much dishevelled and looking the image of grim despair, sitting bolt upright in an empty, filthy manure cart and George, a disreputable-looking object with battered topi and dust-covered garments, walking gloomily behind. </SPAN

>When Aunt Eliza had been with us for about a month, which seemed like years, Mac appeared on the scene. Mac, at that time, lived on one of the outlying estates, far removed from his own kind, and craving for a little excitement and change from the monotony of jungle life, he invited himself for the Christmas weekend. He was a popular favourite, especially with women, and Aunt Eliza succumbed at once to his fascination and charm of manner. He treated her with such courtly deference, and displayed such an interest in all the matters that she had so much at heart, that he went up in her estimation by leaps and bounds. He discussed foreign missions and temperance reform with a seriousness that might lead one to suppose he had given such matters his life long attention. With his tongue in his cheek, he deplored the giddy frivolity of our district. He sternly denounced Sunday tennis and card playing. And he informed her sadly of his vain efforts to rescue planters from their riotous and evil habits. Aunt Eliza was enchanted, and she expressed to me her gratification in at last meeting, in our benighted district, a man who could converse intelligently upon sane and ordinary topics, and whose mind soared above such imbecile matters as pig-sticking and shikar. She thought I ought to encourage his visits to our bungalow, because of the wholesome influence he was bound to exercise over poor George, who she feared was not really as serious-minded as he ought to be. I did not shatter her illusions by presenting her with my own private and unvarnished opinion of Mac, but inwardly I was amused at the idea of his being placed upon a pedestal high above my husband, who was a pillar of rectitude and virtue by comparison. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:38px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>But Mac’s fall was imminent. Christmas came and, as far as I was concerned, my Christmas dinner was emphatically not a success, for it had not proved the hilarious affair that custom had familiarised me with. The presence of my aunt had doubtless acted as a deterrent. But, as the meal progressed, and the champagne flowed, a certain liveliness manifested itself (we had several men-guests), and aunt Eliza’s usually austere and disapproving manner was considerably mellowed by the glasses of milk punch with which Mac plied her, insisting that it was quite a harmless concoction, composed exclusively of milk and lemons. Under its influence, she became loquacious, and in a semi-intoxicated condition she discoursed with eloquence on the need for temperance in India. I was too weighed down by my responsibilities as hostess (two courses at least had turned out failures) to perceive what Charlie was up to, but I dealt severely with him on the following day. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>Christmas Day fell on a Saturday, which was unfortunate, because it meant that if they sat up late they would be desecrating the Sabbath. Not, unfortunately, that this troubled any of us, for the Sabbath was like any other day. But I wished Aunt Eliza’s feelings to be respected. We both retired early. My aunt was nodding in her chair, and I conducted her gently to bed. The rest of the party retired to the verandah, where I knew from past experience that they intended to make a night of it. They behaved exactly according to my expectations. Loud bursts of laughter, gay sing-songs, mostly out of the Students’ Song Book, somebody performing on a mouth-organ, the “boy” being constantly called for to replenish whiskies and sodas. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>At one o’clock in the morning the noise was deafening. I hoped very much that the milk punch would have had a soporific effect upon Aunt Eliza and induce a deep sleep, for in an Indian bungalow it is impossible to deaden sound. At two o’clock in the morning, the noise still went on, even louder. I donned a dressing-gown and went out to request less noise, and to suggest that our guests should depart. But the effects of the milk punch had been more transient than I had hoped, for I found my aunt -a strange looking object in a pink flannelette dressing gown -standing at the drawing room door, looking out in complete bewilderment. Mac, at the moment, was emulating Lottie Collins, then at the zenith of her fame, by dancing a kind of skirt dance to the strains of a gramophone. </SPAN

>Mac, being Highland, always affected a kilt for evening wear, and as he manipulated it in the course of the dance, he raised it higher than accorded with the canons of decency. When he caught sight of my aunt, he, nothing daunted, staggered up to her, made a very low bow and, smiling fatuously, asked her for the pleasure of a dance. But the bow was so profound that, because of his semi-intoxicated condition, he overbalanced and fell on his head at her feet. Too many whisky pegs had proved his undoing. Aunt Eliza rushed from the scene in terror, and a solemn hush fell upon the party, which broke up shortly afterwards. My aunt left two days later to stay at the house of a Scottish missionary in Madras where -she said sadly -she hoped to find herself in more congenial surroundings. I never heard from her again. </SPAN

For, in the backwoods, padres were rare in those days, and christenings and marriages had to be arranged to synchronise with their visits. Funerals were conducted without benefit of clergy, the service being always read by a planter.

Coaches, tongas, bandies, all bullock-drawn, lurched up to the church, whilst a waggonette and a few dogcarts imparted a touch of elegance. The clothes worn by many of the men presented a delightful variety. Some came in their smart volunteer uniforms. Some looked odd and prehistoric in shabby morning coats and large pith sun topees. The only top hat which the district could muster -a shabby affair of a former decade -was borrowed by the bridegroom. </SPAN

At last, we thought, Heaven had been in our favour, for during the past few seasons things on the estate had worked out at a loss. So, on the day the blossom was fully out, I accompanied George when he went round the entire estate to make his estimate. We rode through acres of coffee bushes which were smothered in a glory of snow-white bloom. The flower, which bears a strong resemblance to jasmine, grows in small clusters along the branches, and its perfume is rather overpowering. That morning, the estate presented a brave show under its lovely mantle of foamy white. </SPAN

That evening, after dinner, we sat out on the verandah and engaged in the pleasant task of building air castles. The night was beautifully clear and cool, and myriads of stars hung in a blue-black sky. Fire-flies darted about like jewels, lizards rustled in the bignonia creeper, bull-frogs croaked in the pot plants edging the verandah, and the air was heavy with the strong sickly scent of coffee blossom. But to scents and sounds we were quite oblivious, being busy weaving plans for next year’s hot weather, by which time our fifty-ton crop would have materialised. Of course, we visualised a trip home to see the twins who, naturally, would be overjoyed to see their parents, from whom they had been so long separated. We would arrange to arrive in time to see the daffodils and tulips blooming in the London parks. </SPAN

>Then we proceeded to draw out a glittering programme of all the exciting things we intended doing during our six months’ leave. In imagination we flitted about from one gay and crowded scene to another, and Epsom, Ascot and Goodwood were, in their turn, to be graced by our presence. George sighed happily and said how good it would be to eat decent English beef and drink fine English beer again. My own tastes were less vulgar and inclined to mayonnaise of salmon that had never seen the inside of a tin, and strawberries and cream. </SPAN

This part of the programme was more pleasing to me than the orgy of gaieties which we had arranged to participate in. In imagination, I was back again among the hills and the glens, breathing in, not the sickly perfume of coffee blossom, but the clean, wholesome smell of heather and peat and bog myrtle, and the tang of salt sea-breezes. </SPAN

After an excessively hot day, the sound seemed pleasant, bringing a promise of coolness, but I thought the stream of blasphemy that issued from the next bed strange and quite uncalled for. Then I suddenly came to, and remembered that the blossom was out and had not had time to set, and that heavy rain on it spelt, if not ruin, at least an insignificant crop. It would have been futile for me to utter the consoling words, “Never mind, darling, we at least have each other”, for they would not have been received in the spirit in which they were offered. </SPAN

An unfavourable monsoon, for instance, or a bad attack of leaf disease, or an epidemic of the dreaded borer fly, not to mention a sudden fall in the price of coffee in the London market. Fortunately, however, most planters were the possessors of hopeful temperaments, which helped to carry them through the difficulties with which the thorny path of coffee-growing was beset. And if things went wrong, there was always a “next year” to look forward to. </SPAN

>The River Cauvery rises in the province of Coorg. It is called the Ganges of the South, and devout Hindus make annual pilgrimages to its source and bathe in its waters. In its course through the province, it is tortuous and its bed rocky. Its banks are covered with luxuriant vegetation, a large part of which consists of bamboos. Once, and only once, did we ever picnic on its banks, for it was some distance away, and the roads not too good. Then, a group of men calling themselves Tritons, because their estates extended for some miles along the riverside, conceived the idea of inviting the community to a river picnic. It was the height of the hot weather, always a dull and slack time for those of us who had not gone on holiday. We accepted the invitation with alacrity, and I visualised a lovely, peaceful day on a quiet river-bank, away from coffee and coolies. </SPAN

We drove through some miles of shady estates, across stretches of paddy fields and, finally, through tracts of thick jungle. The river-bank looked like a fair. Dogcarts, tongas and bullock coaches were all cluttered about, while the drivers with their animals sheltered in the shade of thickly foliaged trees. Further down the bank, on a green sward backed by large clumps of bamboo, the guests were assembled. The river looked cool and placid, if rather muddy. Farther downstream, dhobis washed clothes, beating them vigorously against stones. A group of Indian women in bright coloured saris washed their brass cooking pots. Ugly black buffaloes wallowed in the water for coolness. On the spot selected for tiffin, all was noise and hubbub. Some two dozen boys (each guest brought his own servant) unpacked hampers and issued orders in raucous Tamil to the numerous coolies in attendance. </SPAN

It was always a deep mystery to us why this woman, whose father was a London Universal Provider and a Jew (this she did not like to be known, so we considered her an unworthy member of a great race) should think herself better than the rest of us who, though mere Gentiles, were mostly of quite respectable origin.

>of all the men who ostentatiously called themselves Tritons, not one of them could swim. So it was left to Mac to plunge into the river and effect a rescue. When they were both hauled up the steep bank they were wet to the skin. The women led Mrs. Brown Jones into the privacy of a clump of bamboos and helped to divest her of her wet garments, which were spread out to dry. The supply of clothes that could be lent to her for the time being was naturally limited. One lady contributed her much befrilled nainsook petticoat, and another a short box-cloth cape, much in vogue at that period, which she had brought with her as a protection from the night air during her drive home. Mac was led into another bamboo grove to disrobe, but little in the way of male attire with the exception of a blazer and a cummerbund could be offered him. Trousers being unavailable, a tonga dust rug was requisitioned which, when fastened with safety pins, helped to cover his limbs. In this quaint attire he strode about quite unconcerned, just as if they had been his everyday garments. </SPAN

Another, observing that snakes were hypnotised by music, seized the tea-kettle and banged it with a spoon. A resourceful boy, anticipating an attack, had the tablecloth ready to fling it over the enemy and engulf it in its folds, while coolies shouted and gathered branches to ward off an attack. The snake seemed to regard with some surprise the vast army of human beings arrayed against him and the very peculiar tactics which they adopted, and perceiving that the contest was quite unequal, he slithered away into the jungle in disgust. </SPAN

Mac -quite roused -retaliated by hurling the cold fowl in front of him at the culprit. Then the fun began. Rolls, potatoes, curry puffs and other eatables were flung about with great dexterity. The attendant coolies -hands clapped to mouths -giggled at the strange proceedings, but the white-robed “boys” remained impassive. They, doubtless, thought it regrettable that their masters should comport themselves with such an utter lack of dignity. Such riotous conduct on the part of planters seemed to have been regarded with indulgence in the eighties. People argued that young men, isolated for a week or more on outlying estates, had to have an outlet for their high spirits somehow when they emerged from their seclusion, and flinging food about was, perhaps, as harmless as any other diversion. But a visitor, up from Madras, who removed herself from the line of fire and hid behind a banyan tree, was heard to say that she could never make out why planters were held in such low esteem in the cities, but that now she knew! </SPAN

There were, occasionally, epidemics of cholera, when coolies were found dead or dying by the roadside, and when Europeans in outlying districts often succumbed for want of medical care. For, with only one doctor over a wide area and only coolie runners to summon him, he would arrive after a long ride to find the patient either dead or dying. Once we had a bad epidemic of a virulent type of smallpox, a deadly scourge which natives made no effort to avoid. I think it was because they worshipped the Goddess of Destruction, called Kali.

The memory of her funeral still haunts me, for most of the women of the district turned out to pay their last respects to one who had been a great favourite. The funeral was held by torchlight that same night. In the tropics the dead have to be buried at once, and the cemetery was some distance away. The service was read by a planter, and the ceremony made an unforgettable impression as the torches and lanterns flickered in darkness and pouring rain. </SPAN

I allude to superintendents and salaried manager who had not been able to save enough money for their dependents. In such cases there would follow the usual pathetic procedure. The widow’s list sent round the district, or a sale held at her bungalow, when curious people would turn up to view her cherished possessions, which would probably include most of her wedding presents. Then a cheap passage home for herself and her children, to face a new and hard life among strangers, carrying with her poignant memories of happy days that would never return. Always they went home, those tragic widows. Indeed, there was no other resource left to them in those days, for there was little they could do to earn a livelihood in India. </SPAN

>Sustainability is a natural outcome of one of the most important requirements for coffee planting – shade. Indian coffee is one hundred per cent shade-grown, and we owe it to the pioneer planters who, during the period 1820–70 cleared tracts of land for cultivation, yet maintained the second and third tiers of shade trees. So while coffee bushes, inter-cropped with pepper vines are at the base level, the tall ficus, white cedars and mahogany trees form the double and triple layer canopies that are seen throughout the coffee regions, especially at higher elevations. The coffee plantations in the region are demonstrably some of the world’s finest acres of sustainable agriculture. </SPAN

<P style="margin-left:38px; line-height:20px">
<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

While coffee consumption is growing both in the domestic as well as in the international markets, coffee growers face a number of challenges. There is an enormous strain on the land, with coffee growers trying hard to cope with the increasing costs of production and shortage of labour. Coffee cultivation is highly labour intensive, and in the old days it was common to find three generations working on the same estate. Today, thanks to education and improved opportunities, the aspirations of the younger generation have increased, and many are moving out to urban centres in search of more profitable work. Coffee growers are finding it harder and harder to find hands to harvest their crops in the peak season, and the economics of cultivation are increasingly problematic. </SPAN

While coffee is still the mainstay, spice cultivation, floriculture, plantation tourism…all these are making waves in the coffee lands. The net result is that the coffee country of India is on the path to rejuvenation and greater bio-diversity – adding new dimensions, yet again, to the natural heritage. With its sustainable coffee economy, the coffee districts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are justifiably recognised as a national asset – a unique case of Nature and commerce in harmony. </SPAN

The first India Coffee House opened on Churchgate Street in Bombay on 28th September 1936, and quickly became a rendezvous for an entire generation swept up in the political maelstrom of pre-Independent India and through to the revolutionary sixties. The outlets were part of a larger strategy to promote coffee consumption in India, and the India Coffee House chain, later operated by the Coffee Board, reached a peak of 72 outlets, before getting downsized, as the younger generation in India took to colas and carbonated drinks. </SPAN

The credit for raising the profile of coffee retailing in India goes to Barista Coffee Company, which opened shop in New Delhi in March 2000. Over the years, there have been ownership and management changes: the original promoters, Turner Morrison and Co., sold out to the Chennai-based Sterling Infotech Group; and in March 2007, Lavazza, Italy’s largest coffee company, made a strategic entry into India by taking over Barista. Currently there are over 200 Barista Lavazza Espresso Bars and Barista Crème Lavazza’s in over 30 cities in India.

Urban youth of every new generation always tend to stake out a certain public space as their own; certainly the coffee pubs in the Indian metros are the social milieu where the bold and the beautiful get together today. Further, an Indian twist – the accent is on conviviality, on group activity – way different from the coffee pubs in the Western world which are designed for the individual wanting a quick, quiet cuppa. </SPAN

However, with the winds of globalisation and liberalisation reaching Indian shores, forest grown Indian coffee is making inroads in the West as a speciality coffee. The coffee grown under the shade of forest trees has a unique taste of Nature in the cupping quality. There are three key ideas here. This uniqueness is not only the result of the forest factor but also due to the fact that the coffee habitats are an integral part of multi-crops, herbs and spices. In addition, Indian coffee plantations harbour thousands of species of old, diverse and significant species of rare birds, insects and endangered wildlife.

They had the ‘Live and let live’ approach at the back of their mind.

Also, during the hunting season, care was taken such that the female of the species was not hunted down.

>The big cats were selectively shot only because they were man eaters. Planters never killed wildlife indiscriminately. They never used to overdo things. Today the situation is pathetic. The forest itself is in trouble. The wildlife numbers have declined alarmingly due to hunting and clearing of restricted zones within the coffee forest. Deforestation and extension of plantations has also made the task of conserving that much more difficult. Migrations are earmarked as opportunities for poaching. All that remains are fragments of a once pristine wildlife habitat. </SPAN

Dr. Romulus Whitaker, a leading conservationist, is of the opinion that the Western Ghats is one of the largest unbroken pieces of forest. Cutting even a single tree in the dense Western Ghats can cause severe damage to thousands of beneficial microorganisms.

>The fact of the matter is that mono-cropping is the exception in Indian coffee plantations. The rule is a range of simultaneously growing crops. No other plantations in the world have the range of diversity as that seen in Indian coffee plantations. Pepper vines are grown on shade trees; cardamom, arecanut, ginger, orange, citrus, vanilla and a few other spices are grown as multiple crops inside the coffee plantations. Rice and bananas are commercially grown in the valleys. Most of these crops are not only ideal food for elephants but more importantly have higher nutritive content and palatability. These multiple crops act as powerful magnets attracting herds of wild elephants into eco-friendly coffee farms. This leads to negative interactions between humans and elephants, commonly referred to as the ‘human-elephant conflict’. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"

Elephants are known to spend about three-quarters of their time, day and night, selecting, picking, preparing and eating food. An adult elephant in the wild will eat in the region of 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb.) of vegetation per day depending on the habitat and the size of the elephant. </SPAN

>In fact, competition has defined the eating habits of elephants. Each herd needs its own territory to survive. Elephants are not territorial, but they inhabit a particular area if food supply there is in abundance. They also make use of the existing migratory corridors to go from one forest range to the other. Unlike most other mammals, elephant migration consists of a series of migrations in the quest for food. This migratory map is passed on by the matriarch to subsequent generations through the trials of life. Research also indicates that elephant home ranges vary from population to population and habitat to habitat. Individual home ranges vary from 15 to 3700 square km. </SPAN

However, with the advent of modern technology (timber cranes, electric chain saws, bulldozers,etc.) the forest landscape has changed for the worse. A good network of roads leads to the heart of the forests making it that much easier for the poachers. All these factors have a direct impact on the sustainability of the elephant population. </SPAN

The early warning system uses strong, two plus nylon ropes, a few poles and an alarm bell. The rope is tied to the poles, at a height of about 6 feet and the poles are fixed to the ground at a gap of 200 meters. This network connects to an electric bell on a watch tower. As the elephant comes in contact with the nylon rope, the hair on its head gets caught between the plies of the rope and the resultant tension pulls the hair out. Instinctively, the elephant turns away and simultaneously, the alarm bells are triggered warning the villagers. </SPAN

Since chicory helps to retain or hold water a little longer, it enables the water to extract and absorb more flavour from the ground coffee. This makes the South Indian brew a lot stronger than the Western version of drip-style coffee. Ideally, if the coffee brew is allowed to drip naturally, it will slowly collect in the lower container. It would take approximately 45 minutes for all the water to strain. </SPAN

>Usually, about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the collected potent brew is enough to stir up a good cup of coffee in a tumbler or cup of hot milk. Sugar is then added to taste. Quite often, the trick is to avoid stirring the coffee and milk. Typically, piping hot milk is poured over the brew and the sweetener is added. This mixture is then blended together by deftly pouring it back and forth between a steel tumbler called “lotaa” and a lipped bowl called “dabarah”. This swift action of pouring the brew in streams of wide arcs, has a trifold role to play – firstly, it helps to cool down the coffee, secondly, it mixes all the ingredients evenly and thirdly, it works up a rich bubbly foam head above the coffee, without any dilution; much like the action of a steam wand used to make frothing cappuccino. </SPAN

>It was probably the skill of the person who stretched the distance between the tumbler and bowl to about a metre, while pouring the brew without spilling the contents which helped South Indian Filter Coffee earn another moniker – Metre Coffee. Another typical phrase in South India is “By-two coffee” which literally means “one coffee divided by two”. Clearly, the convenient division of drink could be attributed to the social role of coffee – where two individuals can enjoy a shared sense of bonhomie or perhaps, indicate a draining wallet. </SPAN

>Finally, the appreciation of coffee has gone beyond the satisfying “mmmmm” or “aaaah” after the first sip. It has evolved from a personal habit in individual homes, to a social culture popularised by large chain café bars and outlets and more recently, to a global speciality coffee movement called the Third Wave Coffee. The humble brown beverage now relishes the same niche status as high brow forms of culinary appreciation like wine, tea, and chocolate. Not bad, for a little brown seed that suffered an identity crisis of being a fruit, a cherry, a berry and a bean in its lifetime. In the end, it’s just coffee. </SPAN

>The coffee grind – The particle size of the coffee grounds can vary typically from granular to small in the following manner: coarse, medium, fine and espresso (or very fine). Over-extraction can occur if the grind size is too small and could result in the coffee being bitter and too strong. If the granules are too large, under-extraction could leave you with a weak coffee. A coarse grind can be used for a coffee pot, medium grind for a cafeteria (French Press), medium to fine for a typical filter drip machine and super fine grind for an espresso machine. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>Freshness and amount of coffee – Coffee beans must be stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. Long exposure to moisture or atmosphere will cause ground coffee or powder to lose its subtle flavors and aromas. Using less coffee than the recommended amount for an extended brewing time will result in an over-extracted brew. An under-extracted coffee is the consequence of using more than the recommended coffee for a shorter infusion time. </SPAN

Roughly, 10-30 seconds for espresso grind 3-6 minutes for fine grind 6-8 minutes for medium grind 8-10 minutes for coarse grind. </SPAN

Keeping all equipment washed and cleaned is crucial to preparing the perfect cup of coffee. Filters with tiny holes tend to get blocked, so make sure the holes are clear. The filter should be completely dry when you add the powder. </SPAN

>– The world’s most expensive, low-production coffee made from the beans of coffee berries found in the scat of Asian Palm Civet and other civets. The civet eats the berries for their fleshy pulp. As the berries pass through its digestive tract, proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans. The beans are finally excreted, but retain their shape. They are gathered, washed thoroughly, sun dried and light roasted before brewing. Kopi luwak beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness and is still rated as the most expensive coffee in the world! Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago, in the Philippines and East Timor. </SPAN

>The story goes that a flight full of American passengers was recalled to Foynes Airbase (now Shannon International Airport) after braving heavy storms for many hours. Mercifully, the flight landed safely but the panic-stricken passengers were cold and wretched in the icy night air. Joseph Sheridan, the chef at the airbase terminal restaurant took one look at them and decided to whip up a concoction that would warm their bodies and their spirits. He brewed some hot coffee and added a splash of good Irish whiskey to it. The travellers loved it. When one of them asked whether it was Brazilian coffee, Chef Sheridan famously replied, “No, that’s Irish coffee.” Today, you can savour the original Irish Coffee drink at Joe Sheridan Café Bar in the airport, where a plaque marks his achievement. </SPAN

This will result in a layer of liquid cream that floats on top of the coffee. Drinking the coffee through the layer of cream results in the rich, authentic flavor that coffee’s drinkers originally enjoyed. Do not stir. Irish coffee is best enjoyed by sipping the coffee through the cream. Makes 1 serving. </SPAN
