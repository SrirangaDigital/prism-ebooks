      <H1>Ivor Bull -Father of the Indian Coffee Industry </H1>
      <P>Mr. Ivor Bull, the British founder of the Consolidated Coffee Estates Ltd., of Pollibetta in Coorg (Kodagu) and a former chairman of the Coffee Board, could be considered as the father of the Indian coffee industry. </P>
      <P>The ‘pooling system’ of marketing coffee was his brainchild which was put in place during the Second World War to save the planters who were on the verge of ruin. The pooling system was in existence until the mid-1990s for almost 50 years. </P>
      <P>Even as the ‘Quit India’ movement sent panic among the British, Mr. Bull took the bold decision to convert the Consolidated Coffee Estates from a Sterling Company into a Rupee Company in India, in keeping with the prevailing Swadeshi spirit. When other fellow Britishers were getting ready to leave the Country, Mr. Bull demonstrated his abiding faith in India. </P>

      <P>Mr. Bull had also played a pivotal role in establishing the Central Coffee Research </P>
      <P>
        <em>1894–1971, father of the </em>

      <P>
        <em>Indian coffee industry. </em>
      </P>
      <P>He was born in 1894 to a Norwegian father and an English mother. After schooling in Glasgow, he moved to Australia. He was planting fruits in Murray River when the First World War began. He joined the Imperial Australian Army and saw action at the landing of Gallipoli when he suffered bullet injuries on his head. After recovering from his wounds, he returned to action and was shot again, this time through the lungs. </P>
      <P>After the war, he tried to settle down to farming in Kent. Subsequently, he decided to accept a job with a rubber planting company in old Travancore and came out to India in 1929. Since the rubber industry was in trouble, he decided to join coffee planting with Consolidated Coffee Estates in 1929. In 1936, Mr. Bull was appointed General Manager to take over the affairs of the company in India. </P>
      <P>The year he took charge coincided with the launching of the Indian Coffee Cess Committee under the Act of 1936. It was a statutory body set up to promote coffee and expand its market, both within the Country and abroad. </P>
      <P>Mr. Bull also became a member of the Coffee Product Sub-Committee of the United Planters’ Association of Southern India (UPASI). That gave him an opportunity to keep himself posted with developments related to coffee in the Country. </P>
      <P>Around this time, the Second World War broke out. As his young managers were called up for war services, Mr. Bull was forced to manage a large and widely dispersed group of estates in Coorg as well as the curing works at Hunsur, on his own. </P>
      <P>Suddenly, in May 1940, the export market collapsed when the Germans invaded Europe. It was at this stage that Mr. Bull came into his element and the struggling coffee industry found a saviour in him. </P>
      <P>Mr. Bull was also one of the main visionaries of the coffee ‘pooling system’ -a system where all the planters pool their coffee together and market it as a cooperative society. </P>
      <P>In an article, Mr. Bull recalled the traumatic situation brought about by the war: “The Second World War brought another period of great anxiety to planters. At that time I was the Chairman of the Coffee Section of the UPASI, and with memories of earlier days in Australia, I wrote to Mr. Howie, the then Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, who had been a neighbour in South Australia, some 20 years previously. I was aware that these growers had evolved a scheme many years ago, by which an artificial higher price in the Australian market was averaged with the actual realisations on exports which were lower. All produce was graded to fixed standards and pooled for sale at home and abroad.” </P>
      <P>“In the result, growers received a fair price for their fruit. Mr. Howie’s response was immediate and enthusiastic. He sent over all literature regarding their own organisation and also his own views. With the loss of our export markets, it appeared as if we might have to rely on a similar scheme for coffee. The UPASI, carefully studied everything which had been sent and adjusted the Australian scheme to suit our own industry. Our proposals were forwarded to the Government of India as the UPASI recommendations for dealing with the situation.” </P>
      <P>“The proposals were not adopted by the UPASI without opposition, and I still have vivid memories of a frustrating meeting with the curers at Mangalore.” </P>
      <P>“In Delhi, Sir Frederick James who held the European seat in the Legislature was very helpful, and eventually identical proposals came back to South India for discussion at a coffee conference, with the added prestige of being the government’s own recommendations.” </P>
      <P>Since the world market could not indicate a price, Mr. Bull did much to persuade the Government to depute somebody to study and recommend a price for coffee. S.L. Cook, the chief cost accounts officer of the finance department, was deputed to undertake the cost study in 1944. Thereafter, the costing of coffee was to become a periodic exercise for nearly 50 years. </P>
      <P>Mr. Bull was keen on research and provided facilities for Wilson Mayne’s early work in coffee. He was instrumental in the leasing of UPASI’s experimental farm in Balehonnur to Leslie Coleman’s Coffee Research Station, which is now under the Coffee Board. Wilson Mayne was a close friend of Mr. Bull’s. When the pooled marketing system was being moved through UPASI, Mayne was serving as the UPASI Secretary and Mr. Bull worked closely through him. </P>
      <P>Mr. Bull’s involvement with the affairs of the Coffee Board was increasing and finally he was elected to be its Chairman succeeding Sir Datar Singh who was at the time special advisor to the Government of India. </P>
      <P>However, the Coffee Amendment Bill, 1952, moved in the Parliament by the newly formed government was not to the liking of Mr. Bull and it was said that this had something to do with his decision to retire from India in 1954 and return to farming in England. * </P>
      <P>The Bill was reportedly presented to Parliament without prior consultation with the Board of which he was the Chairman, or with the industry. The amendment put an end to the Board’s autonomy. </P>
      <P>The former chairman of the Coorg Planters Association, Mr. K.P. Uthappa recalls an incident that shows the affection that Mr. Bull had for the people of India. “I first saw Mr. Ivor Bull in August, 1942, when the Quit India movement was launched. A large group of high school students from Virajpet came to our school in Pollibetta in Coorg, collected us and marched up to the head office of the Consolidated Coffee Estates Ltd., and started shouting patriotic slogans. Mr. Bull came out of the office and talked with the leaders. Our leaders offered him a ‘Gandhi cap’ which was a red rag, as it were, to the British. Mr. Bull smilingly put the same on his head and we all clapped.” </P>
      <P>From the beginning, Mr. Bull had taken to Coorg and its people with an instinctive insight and warmth which remained with him for the rest of his life. He was an austere man with a formidable forehead and a scarred cheek. His war-time injuries made him somewhat stiff and straight. He had a keen sense of humour. </P>
      <P>His outstanding characteristics were directness, simplicity and total commitment towards any principle that he felt deeply about. </P>
      <P>On his return to England, he bought 365 acres of farm land at Badingham in Suffolk with a bank loan. With the assistance of his daughter Sonja and her husband Russel, he grew fruit and seed crops. </P>
      <P>Mr. Bull built up a flourishing farm business. He passed away in December, 1971, at the age of 77. His wife Catherine, who was once an Australian tennis star, died soon after. </P>

        <H1>Evolution of Coffee </H1>
      </SECTION>
      <P>It is well established that coffee drinking originated in Arabia. The popular legend of how a goatherd named Kaldi in Abyssinia found his goats happily dancing and prancing one evening after eating the coffee berries is the oldest reference to this beverage. The goatherd brought this phenomenon to the notice of a mufti who experimented with the berries and made a brew using the beans. The mufti who had a problem of falling asleep during his prayers now found himself exhilarated and able to keep awake longer. His seminary came to be known as the ‘wakeful monastery’. This news soon spread, and the concoction gained popularity in the Muslim seminaries in the neighbourhood. </P>
      <P>The earliest written reference to coffee is by Rhazes (850-922A.D.) who was a highly respected philosopher, astronomer and physician in Baghdad. The concoction made from coffee bean was known as bunchum at the time, and it was ‘primarily’ recommended for its medicinal properties. In Yemen, this drink gained rapid popularity, and was referred to as Kohwah – precursor to its present name: Coffee. </P>
      <P>Coffee drinking became ritualistic, and the potion was consumed by the devoted dervishes. Most of those in Muslim seminaries in Arabia used to conduct their religious discourses in the evenings to avoid the blistering heat during daytime. Drinking Kohwah kept them alert and awake late into the night. By the end of the fifteenth century, coffee drinking spread to Mecca, Medina and Cairo. It was only a matter of time before the </P>
      <P>general public too took a liking to this beverage. Soon the quality of the decoction was improved by roasting the beans. </P>
      <P>It was in Mecca that the first coffee houses known as ‘Kaveh Kane’ were established. These became recreational centres where people played chess, listened to music and danced. This resulted in poor attendance at the mosques and a section of the rigid clergy started arguing against the beverage. They equated coffee drinking to consumption of wine which was strictly prohibited. Around 1511, the governor of Mecca banned the use of coffee and shut down all the coffee houses. However, the governor’s ‘indiscreet zeal’ was disapproved of by his lord and master: the Sultan of Egypt. Coffee houses were reopened, but many activities such as gambling, singing, and dancing were forbidden. </P>
      <P>With the passage of time coffee drinking flourished and spread to other parts of Middle East, in spite of several attempts by the religious zealots to label the beverage as against the tenets of Islam. People of Constantinople took to the drink and the concept of coffee houses was elevated to a higher level. Kaveh Kanes became like clubs where like minded people could drink coffee and indulge in recreational conversation. In some of the coffee houses in Damascus there were orators who were hired to tell stories – ‘Thousand and One Nights’ being the favourite. Women too drank coffee but only in the privacy of their homes. Around the 17<SPAN><Sup>th </Sup></SPAN>century, refusal or denial of providing coffee for the wives was a legitimate cause for divorce amongst the Turkish men! </P>
      <P>
        <em>Story Teller in a Coffee house in Turkey </em>
      </P>
      <P>Leonhard Rauwolf, a renowned German botanist was the first European to make a written mention of Kohwah in 1573. Venetian traders introduced coffee into Europe in 1615. They called the beverage ‘Cavee’ and it became trendy in Venice. With coffee becoming increasingly popular in Rome, it came under criticism by the clergy who denounced it as an invention of Satan! Pope Clement VIII was approached by the priests to prohibit the consumption of what they called the ‘Devil’s Drink’ by Christians. The priests further informed the Pope that the drink was being introduced by the infidels to entice Christians to fall into a trap set by Satan. </P>
      <SECTION>
        <P>Pope Clement VIII was curious and wanted to make a thorough study of this beverage. He asked for the concoction to be brought to him for inspection. The Pope found the aroma so pleasant and inviting that he was tempted to taste the drink. After drinking it he exclaimed: ‘Why, this Satan’s drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We shall fool the Satan by baptising it, and making it a truly Christian beverage.’ To the astonishment of the priests, Pope Clement VIII ceremoniously baptised coffee and proclaimed it as a truly ‘Christian beverage’. This papal act gave a strong fillip to coffee and its popularity started spreading all over Europe. </P>

      <P>The credit for establishing the first coffee house in the Western world goes to Italy, and they called it a Caffe. The French and the Austrians were quick to follow the Italians. They vastly improved upon the concept of coffee houses. European coffee houses attracted all classes of people. During the early part of the day came the merchants, lawyers, physicians, brokers, workers and wandering vendors. In the afternoons, and until the late hours came the leisure classes including the ladies. </P>
      <P>Even though many English travellers had knowledge of the beverage and had written about it, the first coffeehouse to be established in England was only in 1650 at Oxford. Coffee became very popular amongst the students at Oxford. It was only a matter of time before it spread to other parts of England and Ireland. </P>
      <P>Coffee was publicly sold in Holland in 1664 and coffee houses sprang up in various parts of the Country. However, the Dutch had started trading in coffee years earlier. With demand for the beverage increasing manifold, the Dutch experimented with growing the beans in Ceylon and in Java, Indonesia. Systematic cultivation of coffee was started in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1690. </P>
      <P>Coffee was introduced to America by Captain John Smith who in 1607 founded the colony of Virginia. With more and more immigrants flooding the Colony from Europe, coffee became as popular as tea. The United States of America is now a major consumer of this beverage. </P>
      <P>With the growing popularity of the refreshing drink, it soon attracted taxation. There was also constant slander and persecution of the beverage from certain quarters – especially the religious zealots in Arabia and Europe. There were also adverse propaganda and attacks on coffee by the pub and ale-house keepers who found their business being usurped by the coffee houses. But coffee withstood all these attempts to discredit it, and continued to gain further popularity. It became increasingly fashionable to drink coffee especially in coffee houses. With the passage of time various new techniques of brewing coffee emerged. </P>
      <P>By about 1715 there were reportedly more than 2000 coffee houses in London. During this critical period in English history people were tired of misgovernment and coffee houses became the sanctuary where political reforms were freely discussed. It is said that England’s great struggle for political liberty was actually fought and won in the coffee houses. Coffee soon acquired a reputation as a beverage which encouraged revolutionary thoughts and changes in society. Wherever coffee was consumed revolution was not far behind. </P>
      <P>By the nineteenth century coffee houses all over Europe were places where intellectuals gathered and discussed various issues. Newspapers became popular in coffee houses and many came to catch up with the latest news. There were several philosophers, writers, and artists who had their own favourite coffee house and anyone wanting to meet these gentlemen could do so at their most preferred haunts. There were animated discussions but unlike in the pubs and ale houses none were intoxicated. In Austria, some of the regulars such as psychologist Sigmund Freud had the name and address of their coffee houses printed on their letterheads. </P>

      </P>
      <P>Demand for coffee started growing exponentially all over Europe and in their respective colonies. Coffee cultivation was started in various parts of Africa, South America and Asia. </P>
      <P>Modern coffee houses such as Starbucks, Costa, Barista, et al can be found all over the world, and coffee is witnessing a surge in consumption in all the emerging economies. Coffee is now associated with IT professionals who have named one of the main software languages after coffee, namely: Java. Computer programmers are known to consume large quantities of this refreshing beverage which stimulates their brains to come up with better programmes. It is now known as a drink favoured by the geeks. In India, Café Coffee Day has successfully catered to the need of the geeks, and one can find hordes of them spending hours over a cup of coffee in the ambiance of modern coffee houses. </P>

      <H1>Plantation Life in the 1880s </H1>
      <P>It was in eighties (1880s) that I came out to Coorg (Kodagu) for a visit and stayed for fifty years. Life in a coffee district in those days differed widely from that in towns and gay hill stations which offered a constant variety of amusements. Here, Europeans were sparse and widely scattered, and often a distance of twenty or thirty miles intervened between estates and European neighbours. </P>
      <P>Upon first coming out, therefore, a woman was apt to find life more than a little dull, especially if she had been brought up in a town. But she soon got used to changed conditions, and settled down quite contentedly to the quiet lot of a planter’s wife. The state of the crops, the aspect of the clouds, the conditions of coolie labour, and other matters incidental to coffee planting would gradually assume for her an all-absorbing interest, and in a year’s time she would probably wonder how any other life could have held any charms for her. </P>
      <P>On a coffee estate, the day began early. At six-thirty, one was wakened by the clanging of the estate bell, which summoned coolies to muster-roll before starting their day’s work. At the same hour, the early cup of tea materialised for the dorai and doraisanny (Master and Mistress). Then at seven, out on the verandah, chota hazri – a substantial meal of porridge, eggs and bacon, coffee and fruit. For the dorai there came the morning round on the estate. For his wife the walk, or ride, before engaging in the usual household routine, such as the ordering of meals, the weighing-out of all the commodities required for the day, seeing that the drinking water was boiled, and, by using a lactometer, finding out that the milk had not been watered, and so on. </P>
      <P>Then the twelve o’clock breakfast – usually a substantial meal of many courses, at which the dorai presented himself, hot and tired, after much wrestling with coolies and maistries. </P>
      <P>For those who were near tennis courts and men’s and women’s clubs, tennis, whist (bridge had not yet arrived), and billiards filled in the afternoons and evenings until the eight o’clock dinner. But for people like ourselves, miles away from such distractions, there was little to fill in the time beyond boring rambles on the estate until nightfall and, when alone, early to bed. </P>
      <P>The daily round varied according to the time of year. There were three seasons </P>
      <P>– the monsoon, from early June until September; the cold weather, from then until February; and the hot weather, until May. For the housewife, the monsoon was the most trying time if she were isolated from neighbours. Being the time for planting, her husband was fully occupied with estate work during the greater part of the day, so she had many lonely hours to put in. </P>
      <P>If, however, she developed a taste for gardening, she could pass many pleasant hours in pursuit of her hobby, and she was amply rewarded for the time and trouble which she lavished on her garden. Flowers grew in profusion, and after the rains a well-kept garden with its blaze of scarlet poinsettias, masses of delicate blue plumbago, tuberoses, heliotrope and gardenias, besides glowing beds of English annuals, presented a sight hard to beat for wealth and variety of colour. </P>

        <H4>The Scot Connection: </H4>
        <P>In our province, besides a fair sprinkling of Scots, there was quite a large element of Highlanders. This is explained by the fact that a native of Skye was one of the early pioneers of coffee in South India. Through his influence, many Highland boys gravitated to Coorg, where they found careers as planters. When sufficiently well off, they imported sisters who, in due course, married and had families. Thus, the Highland colony grew and multiplied. English people were apt to regard the Scots with a kindly tolerance. </P>

        <H4>Capital Capers: </H4>
        <P>Mercara (Madikeri) – the capital of the province – was a pleasant little station some twenty-five miles distant. It was mostly inhabited by government officials and a few retired planters. </P>
        <P>Here, during a few weeks in the hot weather, the Commissioner held court. Those of us who could not afford the more expensive sea changes to Colombo or Rangoon, usually gravitated to Mercara where, for about a month, we rented bungalows at exorbitant prices, paid calls on the residents according to Indian custom, wrote our names in the Commissioner’s book, and received invitations to the many gay activities got up for the benefit of visitors. These included dinners and dances, tennis tournaments and gymkhanas, race meetings and early morning riding picnics. As all this went on mostly without a break, we used to arrive back on the estate exhausted wrecks. It was, however, a wonderful change, and made up for many dull days throughout the year. By the time we returned, the hot weather was almost at its end, and the monsoon and hard work for the planter loomed near. </P>

        <H4>A New Year’s Party : </H4>
        <P>And then, a party given by Harry Graham to usher in the New Year stands out in my memory. Harry was a well-to-do bachelor who liked entertaining and who prided himself on doing things in better style than anyone else in the district. If a dinner is to be judged by the profusion of its courses, the splendid repasts at which we periodically assisted always excelled in this respect. Harry, being a Scot, was rather economical of speech, and we always figured at those symposiums because George, who never knew when to stop talking, was counted on to keep things going and talk agreeably to the ladies. </P>
        <P>In our district, my husband had a wholly exaggerated reputation as a witty conversationalist, which made him a welcome guest at any dinner table. Shortly after our marriage, I came to realise my own complete insignificance in the general scheme of things, and when we were asked to parties I knew full well that it was not owing to my own personal worth or charm, but because George could keep a dinner table interested and amused with a great deal of nonsense. </P>
        <P>On this occasion, we were told that oysters from the West Coast, sixty miles distant, were to be the chief item on the menu, and as there was no railway, coolie-runners were to be posted every five miles to ensure that the delicacies should arrive in a perfectly fresh condition. Humble people like ourselves had to be content with things out of a tin, presented in the guise of “oyster fatties” or “oyster escallops”, but to Harry, who was prosperous, expense was no object. </P>
        <P>We had a ride of eight miles to negotiate, and I remember I was strangely attired in a black lace evening dress covered with a riding apron, and a moth-eaten fur cape. This was to avoid the fag of changing, and bachelors’ bungalows in those days were rather deficient in bedroom appointments. But George elected to send his evening kit -which was packed in a flat tin box -on ahead. In Harry’s spare bedroom I was engaged in adjusting my hair in front of an inadequate glass with an eruption of black spots, which had an annoying habit of swinging round and hitting me on the face, when I heard a blast of lurid language issuing from the adjoining dressing room. On investigation, I found George in his shirt sleeves contemplating with horror the bodice of a pink satin evening dress, which he presently rolled into a tight ball and flung into the furthermost corner of the room. Other articles of female attire, such as a frilly petticoat, shoes and silk stockings received the same drastic treatment. I recognised the pink satin as the property of Mrs. Brown Jones whom I knew was due to dine at a bungalow eight miles away. The obvious solution was that our respective coolies had foregathered at a wayside arrack shop, and that in the darkness the boxes had got mixed up, for after all one flat tin box -the usual receptacle in those days for carrying clothes -was much like another. Although not naturally vindictive, the thought of Mrs. Brown Jones having to sit down to dinner in a tweed riding habit, amidst an assemblage of pretty frocks, did not excite my sympathy, for a month before she had not only bribed away my cook with the offer of bigger wages, but had by the same ignoble means lured away the only coolie on the premises who had the intelligence to comprehend the eccentricities of my Tamil. George, to his great annoyance, had to dine in his riding kit, as he was unable to borrow any garments from Harry who was of much shorter build. </P>
        <P>We all sat down expectantly to enjoy fresh oysters straight from the coast of Malabar. But the advent of the soup crushed our hopes, and we concluded that the coolies had not run fast enough. When Harry’s enquiries in an agitated whisper elicited the reply, “Please, sar, cook done make into oyster fatties”, our host sank back in his chair bereft of speech, and an apoplectic fit seemed imminent, while we ate our “fatties”, which we could have got at our own dinner tables any day of the week, with the contempt born of familiarity. </P>
        <P>During the next course, a collision occurred between two of the boys, resulting in the floor being decorated with foie gras in aspic and fragments of crockery. This time, Harry uttered a stream of horrible language under his breath. The foie gras, having been retrieved by the hands of native boys and presented to us, was not unnaturally declined by all, excepting George who, engaged in fluent conversation, remained undisturbed by the fact that he partook of food liberally coated with dust. The turkey was half raw, the curacoa soufflé watery, and the angels on horseback uneatable. It was clear on the face of it that Harry’s cook, who was really an excellent servant, had been “celebrating”, and I knew he would be summarily dealt with on the morrow. </P>
        <P>After dinner, George excelled himself. He sang five comic songs and, to the music of Mac’s bagpipes – played out on the terrace – he gave an exhibition of his own special interpretation of the sword dance, prancing round a carving knife and fork crossed like swords. In short, he monopolised the whole evening. At twelve o’clock the rum punch circulated, healths were drunk, and Auld Lang Syne sung with fervour. Soon afterwards we rode out into the night amidst a chorus of “Happy New Years”. At parting, our host wrung George’s hand and said he had been the life and soul of the evening, to which George replied modestly, “Do not mention it, old chappie”. </P>

        <H4>A Visitor Arrives: </H4>
        <P>Aunt Eliza happens to be one of those goody-goody people with a mania for reforming this wicked world. She thinks card-playing sinful. She regards non-teetotalers as on the straight road to perdition, and before she is half an hour in the bungalow she will probably ask you if you have found Christ. </P>
        <P>Aunt Eliza duly turned up some weeks before Christmas. Her arrival into our midst could hardly be described as a state entry. Out of pure goodness of heart, George drove out in his dogcart fifteen miles of the way to meet her. It will be an agreeable change after miles of jolting in a crawling cow carriage, he had said amiably that morning. But when I saw him tearing down the drive at a furious pace, Kitty, who was fresh and skittish, having done a little preliminary waltzing among my flower-beds, I was seized with misgivings as to the success of the enterprise. George was an utterly reckless driver, and truth compels me to state that the occasions on which I trusted myself to his care were fraught with such painful memories that, latterly, I preferred to take my drives abroad in a more safe, if less dashing, bullock vehicle. </P>
        <P>They were expected by tea-time. Long before that hour, however, I beheld Kitty galloping merrily up our drive, with fragments of George’s cherished dogcart dangling behind. By the time the grass-cutter had extricated the animal, Hussein the syce, breathless with much running, arrived and put me in possession of details. When passing a native village, the horse had shied at the sound of tom-toms, and the Sahib, being unprepared, she got out of hand and bolted. Rounding a corner, they were all three pitched out and Kitty galloped home. No one was hurt and the Sahib was able to engage a bandy (country cart) to bring the Mem Sahib home. Hussein’s report prepared me for the melancholy procession which, about an hour later, wended its way at a snail’s pace up our drive. Aunt Eliza, much dishevelled and looking the image of grim despair, sitting bolt upright in an empty, filthy manure cart and George, a disreputable-looking object with battered topi and dust-covered garments, walking gloomily behind. </P>
        <P>When Aunt Eliza had been with us for about a month, which seemed like years, Mac appeared on the scene. Mac, at that time, lived on one of the outlying estates, far removed from his own kind, and craving for a little excitement and change from the monotony of jungle life, he invited himself for the Christmas weekend. He was a popular favourite, especially with women, and Aunt Eliza succumbed at once to his fascination and charm of manner. He treated her with such courtly deference, and displayed such an interest in all the matters that she had so much at heart, that he went up in her estimation by leaps and bounds. He discussed foreign missions and temperance reform with a seriousness that might lead one to suppose he had given such matters his life long attention. With his tongue in his cheek, he deplored the giddy frivolity of our district. He sternly denounced Sunday tennis and card playing. And he informed her sadly of his vain efforts to rescue planters from their riotous and evil habits. Aunt Eliza was enchanted, and she expressed to me her gratification in at last meeting, in our benighted district, a man who could converse intelligently upon sane and ordinary topics, and whose mind soared above such imbecile matters as pig-sticking and shikar. She thought I ought to encourage his visits to our bungalow, because of the wholesome influence he was bound to exercise over poor George, who she feared was not really as serious-minded as he ought to be. I did not shatter her illusions by presenting her with my own private and unvarnished opinion of Mac, but inwardly I was amused at the idea of his being placed upon a pedestal high above my husband, who was a pillar of rectitude and virtue by comparison. </P>
        <P>But Mac’s fall was imminent. Christmas came and, as far as I was concerned, my Christmas dinner was emphatically not a success, for it had not proved the hilarious affair that custom had familiarised me with. The presence of my aunt had doubtless acted as a deterrent. But, as the meal progressed, and the champagne flowed, a certain liveliness manifested itself (we had several men-guests), and aunt Eliza’s usually austere and disapproving manner was considerably mellowed by the glasses of milk punch with which Mac plied her, insisting that it was quite a harmless concoction, composed exclusively of milk and lemons. Under its influence, she became loquacious, and in a semi-intoxicated condition she discoursed with eloquence on the need for temperance in India. I was too weighed down by my responsibilities as hostess (two courses at least had turned out failures) to perceive what Charlie was up to, but I dealt severely with him on the following day. </P>
        <P>Christmas Day fell on a Saturday, which was unfortunate, because it meant that if they sat up late they would be desecrating the Sabbath. Not, unfortunately, that this troubled any of us, for the Sabbath was like any other day. But I wished Aunt Eliza’s feelings to be respected. We both retired early. My aunt was nodding in her chair, and I conducted her gently to bed. The rest of the party retired to the verandah, where I knew from past experience that they intended to make a night of it. They behaved exactly according to my expectations. Loud bursts of laughter, gay sing-songs, mostly out of the Students’ Song Book, somebody performing on a mouth-organ, the “boy” being constantly called for to replenish whiskies and sodas. </P>
        <P>At one o’clock in the morning the noise was deafening. I hoped very much that the milk punch would have had a soporific effect upon Aunt Eliza and induce a deep sleep, for in an Indian bungalow it is impossible to deaden sound. At two o’clock in the morning, the noise still went on, even louder. I donned a dressing-gown and went out to request less noise, and to suggest that our guests should depart. But the effects of the milk punch had been more transient than I had hoped, for I found my aunt -a strange looking object in a pink flannelette dressing gown -standing at the drawing room door, looking out in complete bewilderment. Mac, at the moment, was emulating Lottie Collins, then at the zenith of her fame, by dancing a kind of skirt dance to the strains of a gramophone. </P>
        <P>Mac, being Highland, always affected a kilt for evening wear, and as he manipulated it in the course of the dance, he raised it higher than accorded with the canons of decency. When he caught sight of my aunt, he, nothing daunted, staggered up to her, made a very low bow and, smiling fatuously, asked her for the pleasure of a dance. But the bow was so profound that, because of his semi-intoxicated condition, he overbalanced and fell on his head at her feet. Too many whisky pegs had proved his undoing. Aunt Eliza rushed from the scene in terror, and a solemn hush fell upon the party, which broke up shortly afterwards. My aunt left two days later to stay at the house of a Scottish missionary in Madras where -she said sadly -she hoped to find herself in more congenial surroundings. I never heard from her again. </P>

        <H4>A Wedding: </H4>
        <P>It was a relief when they became engaged. It was a still greater relief when the marriage had to be rushed on to coincide with the Madras padre’s annual visit. For, in the backwoods, padres were rare in those days, and christenings and marriages had to be arranged to synchronise with their visits. Funerals were conducted without benefit of clergy, the service being always read by a planter. And so, Veronica had to dispense with a trousseau and a white satin dress, but it mattered little since most of her Bond Street clothes were still intact. </P>
        <P>The church was miles away, and we held the reception at the Club, as being central and more accessible to the guests who thronged from every corner of the district and who arrived in a curious variety of vehicles. Coaches, tongas, bandies, all bullock-drawn, lurched up to the church, whilst a waggonette and a few dogcarts imparted a touch of elegance. The clothes worn by many of the men presented a delightful variety. Some came in their smart volunteer uniforms. Some looked odd and prehistoric in shabby morning coats and large pith sun topees. The only top hat which the district could muster -a shabby affair of a former decade -was borrowed by the bridegroom. </P>
        <P>At the reception, as the champagne flowed, many of the men got rather disorderly. </P>
        <P>The bride and bridegroom were driven away in the waggonette. The rice throwing and the shouting, added to the fact that two of the hilarious guests insisted upon climbing into the waggonette, maddened the horses. They plunged and tried to rear until, finally, getting out of hand, they bolted down the hill in a cloud of red dust, the bride and bridegroom and the two lively men clinging wildly to one another. That was my last sight of Veronica, until their return from the Nilgiris, a month later. </P>
        <P>Blossom Showers: </P>
        <P>I remember one year when the showers were absolutely right for us -neither too heavy nor too light -although our two neighbouring estates came off badly. At last, we thought, Heaven had been in our favour, for during the past few seasons things on the estate had worked out at a loss. So, on the day the blossom was fully out, I accompanied George when he went round the entire estate to make his estimate. We rode through acres of coffee bushes which were smothered in a glory of snow-white bloom. The flower, which bears a strong resemblance to jasmine, grows in small clusters along the branches, and its perfume is rather overpowering. That morning, the estate presented a brave show under its lovely mantle of foamy white. </P>
        <P>Barring inopportune happenings, George estimated the crop likely to accrue at fifty tons, and as the utmost Bunagiri had ever achieved was twenty-five, we returned home well satisfied with our morning’s expedition. That evening, after dinner, we sat out on the verandah and engaged in the pleasant task of building air castles. The night was beautifully clear and cool, and myriads of stars hung in a blue-black sky. Fire-flies darted about like jewels, lizards rustled in the bignonia creeper, bull-frogs croaked in the pot plants edging the verandah, and the air was heavy with the strong sickly scent of coffee blossom. But to scents and sounds we were quite oblivious, being busy weaving plans for next year’s hot weather, by which time our fifty-ton crop would have materialised. Of course, we visualised a trip home to see the twins who, naturally, would be overjoyed to see their parents, from whom they had been so long separated. We would arrange to arrive in time to see the daffodils and tulips blooming in the London parks. </P>
        <P>Then we proceeded to draw out a glittering programme of all the exciting things we intended doing during our six months’ leave. In imagination we flitted about from one gay and crowded scene to another, and Epsom, Ascot and Goodwood were, in their turn, to be graced by our presence. George sighed happily and said how good it would be to eat decent English beef and drink fine English beer again. My own tastes were less vulgar and inclined to mayonnaise of salmon that had never seen the inside of a tin, and strawberries and cream. </P>
        <P>Following our giddy round of gaieties in England, there would come the heavenly calm of August and September in the Highlands. This part of the programme was more pleasing to me than the orgy of gaieties which we had arranged to participate in. In imagination, I was back again among the hills and the glens, breathing in, not the sickly perfume of coffee blossom, but the clean, wholesome smell of heather and peat and bog myrtle, and the tang of salt sea-breezes. </P>
        <P>We retired early, having spent a highly agreeable evening. At about midnight I was awakened by the sound of heavy rain beating down upon the shingled roof. After an excessively hot day, the sound seemed pleasant, bringing a promise of coolness, but I thought the stream of blasphemy that issued from the next bed strange and quite uncalled for. Then I suddenly came to, and remembered that the blossom was out and had not had time to set, and that heavy rain on it spelt, if not ruin, at least an insignificant crop. It would have been futile for me to utter the consoling words, “Never mind, darling, we at least have each other”, for they would not have been received in the spirit in which they were offered. </P>
        <P>Next morning the rain-guage registered nearly two inches of rain, which meant the destruction of about half the crop. </P>
        <P>Such a contingency was not unusual in coffee-growing districts. There were other drawbacks which might have to be faced throughout the year to prevent the realisation of a planter’s fond dreams. An unfavourable monsoon, for instance, or a bad attack of leaf disease, or an epidemic of the dreaded borer fly, not to mention a sudden fall in the price of coffee in the London market. Fortunately, however, most planters were the possessors of hopeful temperaments, which helped to carry them through the difficulties with which the thorny path of coffee-growing was beset. And if things went wrong, there was always a “next year” to look forward to. </P>

        <H4>A Picnic On The Cauvery: </H4>
        <P>The River Cauvery rises in the province of Coorg. It is called the Ganges of the South, and devout Hindus make annual pilgrimages to its source and bathe in its waters. In its course through the province, it is tortuous and its bed rocky. Its banks are covered with luxuriant vegetation, a large part of which consists of bamboos. Once, and only once, did we ever picnic on its banks, for it was some distance away, and the roads not too good. Then, a group of men calling themselves Tritons, because their estates extended for some miles along the riverside, conceived the idea of inviting the community to a river picnic. It was the height of the hot weather, always a dull and slack time for those of us who had not gone on holiday. We accepted the invitation with alacrity, and I visualised a lovely, peaceful day on a quiet river-bank, away from coffee and coolies. </P>
        <P>It took us over an hour in a jolting bullock tonga to achieve our destination. We drove through some miles of shady estates, across stretches of paddy fields and, finally, through tracts of thick jungle. The river-bank looked like a fair. Dogcarts, tongas and bullock coaches were all cluttered about, while the drivers with their animals sheltered in the shade of thickly foliaged trees. Further down the bank, on a green sward backed by large clumps of bamboo, the guests were assembled. The river looked cool and placid, if rather muddy. Farther downstream, dhobis washed clothes, beating them vigorously against stones. A group of Indian women in bright coloured saris washed their brass cooking pots. Ugly black buffaloes wallowed in the water for coolness. On the spot selected for tiffin, all was noise and hubbub. Some two dozen boys (each guest brought his own servant) unpacked hampers and issued orders in raucous Tamil to the numerous coolies in attendance. </P>
        <P>We all settled down in small groups to discuss the latest “gup”, but Mrs. Brown Jones (who had once bagged my cook) took up an aloof position on a branch which overhung the river and surveyed the proceedings with cold disdain. It was always a deep mystery to us why this woman, whose father was a London Universal Provider and a Jew (this she did not like to be known, so we considered her an unworthy member of a great race) should think herself better than the rest of us who, though mere Gentiles, were mostly of quite respectable origin. But she had a fat income of her own, and she could afford to get her clothes from Paris, whilst most of us women, what with husbands who drew small salaries, and many with children at home, were deadly poor, and so we had to be content with “verandah-made” garments which had little of “chic” about them. As Mrs. Brown-looking very elegant in a pale green embroidered muslin -posed on her branch, it unfortunately proved unstable and snapped. With a shriek she fell into the river, which was deep in that particular part; also crocodiles were not unknown. </P>
        <P>We all rushed to the edge of the steep bank to look with horror on the struggling figure. It was surprising that, </P>
        <P>of all the men who ostentatiously called themselves Tritons, not one of them could swim. So it was left to Mac to plunge into the river and effect a rescue. When they were both hauled up the steep bank they were wet to the skin. The women led Mrs. Brown Jones into the privacy of a clump of bamboos and helped to divest her of her wet garments, which were spread out to dry. The supply of clothes that could be lent to her for the time being was naturally limited. One lady contributed her much befrilled nainsook petticoat, and another a short box-cloth cape, much in vogue at that period, which she had brought with her as a protection from the night air during her drive home. Mac was led into another bamboo grove to disrobe, but little in the way of male attire with the exception of a blazer and a cummerbund could be offered him. Trousers being unavailable, a tonga dust rug was requisitioned which, when fastened with safety pins, helped to cover his limbs. In this quaint attire he strode about quite unconcerned, just as if they had been his everyday garments. </P>
        <P>Presently, Mrs. Brown Jones rushed shrieking out of her grove, and said a cobra was sitting up in a corner wagging his head at her. An inspection revealed the cobra, hood extended and ready to strike. </P>
        <P>On the instant all was pandemonium. There were no suitable implements at hand to keep the reptile at bay, but two brave men seized the boat oars which they brandished wildly. Another, observing that snakes were hypnotised by music, seized the tea-kettle and banged it with a spoon. A resourceful boy, anticipating an attack, had the tablecloth ready to fling it over the enemy and engulf it in its folds, while coolies shouted and gathered branches to ward off an attack. The snake seemed to regard with some surprise the vast army of human beings arrayed against him and the very peculiar tactics which they adopted, and perceiving that the contest was quite unequal, he slithered away into the jungle in disgust. </P>
        <P>So much exhausting work seemed to call for aperitifs which, in the case of the men, took the form of whisky pegs. Then came tiffin, which was excellent. Lobster salad, chicken in aspic, cold saddle of mutton, curry puffs (these were made of pastry enclosing curried mince, and very good) and an assortment of cold sweets figured on the menu and, as we sat round a groaning table-cloth, a holy calm seemed to descend upon the company, and all became engrossed in the business of eating. </P>
        <P>Presently, a man, when he had apparently eaten to repletion, decided to break the solemnity of the proceedings by hitting Mac on the nose with a hot baked potato. Mac -quite roused -retaliated by hurling the cold fowl in front of him at the culprit. Then the fun began. Rolls, potatoes, curry puffs and other eatables were flung about with great dexterity. The attendant coolies -hands clapped to mouths -giggled at the strange proceedings, but the white-robed “boys” remained impassive. They, doubtless, thought it regrettable that their masters should comport themselves with such an utter lack of dignity. Such riotous conduct on the part of planters seemed to have been regarded with indulgence in the eighties. People argued that young men, isolated for a week or more on outlying estates, had to have an outlet for their high spirits somehow when they emerged from their seclusion, and flinging food about was, perhaps, as harmless as any other diversion. But a visitor, up from Madras, who removed herself from the line of fire and hid behind a banyan tree, was heard to say that she could never make out why planters were held in such low esteem in the cities, but that now she knew! </P>
        <P>I was quite pleased to get back to the quiet of my own home -for the peaceful picnic which I had looked forward to had not materialised. It had held too many exciting incidents. </P>

        <H4>Life’s Little Difficulties: </H4>
        <P>But life in our province was not always light-hearted and carefree. It often had its tragic side. There were, occasionally, epidemics of cholera, when coolies were found dead or dying by the roadside, and when Europeans in outlying districts often succumbed for want of medical care. For, with only one doctor over a wide area and only coolie runners to summon him, he would arrive after a long ride to find the patient either dead or dying. Once we had a bad epidemic of a virulent type of smallpox, a deadly scourge which natives made no effort to avoid. I think it was because they worshipped the Goddess of Destruction, called Kali. And in those faraway days, inoculation was almost unheard of. </P>
        <P>Once a planter’s wife, who lived quite near us, died of the disease. She had contracted it from her ayah. The memory of her funeral still haunts me, for most of the women of the district turned out to pay their last respects to one who had been a great favourite. The funeral was held by torchlight that same night. In the tropics the dead have to be buried at once, and the cemetery was some distance away. The service was read by a planter, and the ceremony made an unforgettable impression as the torches and lanterns flickered in darkness and pouring rain. </P>
        <P>Then there were the many occasions when men died, leaving wives and children ill provided for. I allude to superintendents and salaried manager who had not been able to save enough money for their dependents. In such cases there would follow the usual pathetic procedure. The widow’s list sent round the district, or a sale held at her bungalow, when curious people would turn up to view her cherished possessions, which would probably include most of her wedding presents. Then a cheap passage home for herself and her children, to face a new and hard life among strangers, carrying with her poignant memories of happy days that would never return. Always they went home, those tragic widows. Indeed, there was no other resource left to them in those days, for there was little they could do to earn a livelihood in India. </P>

      <P>reaching a low of 72,400 hectares in 1941. </P>
      <P>During the last 60 years, significant strides have been made in the development of disease-resistant varieties of coffee and in plantation management practices, with the research and extension wings of the Coffee Board of India playing a pivotal role. Today, India has nearly 3,90,000 hectares of private coffee plantations, a majority of which are in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. </P>
      <P>Over a span of nearly two hundred years, the coffee industry has integrated seamlessly into the region, such that today, the plantations are as natural as the rain-forests, and coffee itself is now crucial to the ecology of the Western Ghats. </P>
      <P>The credit for instituting a tradition of sustainability must surely go to the thousands of individual coffee planters, as well as the large and medium plantation companies who have integrated sustainability into their processes, from a production as well as a lifestyle perspective. </P>
      <P>Sustainability is a natural outcome of one of the most important requirements for coffee planting – shade. Indian coffee is one hundred per cent shade-grown, and we owe it to the pioneer planters who, during the period 1820–70 cleared tracts of land for cultivation, yet maintained the second and third tiers of shade trees. So while coffee bushes, inter-cropped with pepper vines are at the base level, the tall ficus, white cedars and mahogany trees form the double and triple layer canopies that are seen throughout the coffee regions, especially at higher elevations. The coffee plantations in the region are demonstrably some of the world’s finest acres of sustainable agriculture. </P>
      <P>This has given India a unique heritage of sustainable coffee production; the subsequent advances in research and technology have only added layers of sophistication to the natural processes instituted in the early years of development. Shade-grown coffee, much desired internationally, is what gives Indian coffee its cache and distinguishes it from other origins in the global market. </P>
      <P>The Indian coffee planter is not just savvy about the concept of shade contributing to high-quality coffee, he is equally respectful of his natural surroundings, and has over time adopted a lifestyle to make the most of his habitat, and preserve it for tourists and visitors to enjoy. </P>
      <P>The coffee growing districts represent some of the best natural forest reserves anywhere in the world, and a real treasure-house for trekkers, bird-watchers and wildlife enthusiasts. The estates co-exist side-by-side with national parks teeming with flora and fauna. Wild boars and elephants still roam freely through the plantations and, being 100 per cent tree-shaded, the coffee estates support extensive bird-life. </P>
      <P>Ornithologists have conclusively proved that one need not go only to bird sanctuaries to observe birds – a coffee estate would do as well! During the monsoons, the tree cover acts as a sponge and later feeds life-giving water to the east and west flowing rivers. </P>
      <P>A recent trend in the core coffee regions has been the shift to organic cultivation. Several committed growers have adopted various methods of organic cultivation, ranging from non-use of chemical inputs to proactive biodynamic processes. Conversion of farms and estates to organic methods has in fact improved the soil quality and rejuvenated the land, resulting in a greener environment with more birds and butterflies besides healthier plants. Organic cultivation has increased the value of the produce, and has contributed towards even more sustainable coffee plantation. </P>
      <P>So integral is coffee to the ecology of the Western Ghats that any change in land-use could have serious consequences in an area that is considered one of the world’s hot-spots in terms of bio-diversity. </P>
      <P>Looking beyond the idyllic landscapes, there is cause for concern, as coffee regions face threats due to various factors. While coffee consumption is growing both in the domestic as well as in the international markets, coffee growers face a number of challenges. There is an enormous strain on the land, with coffee growers trying hard to cope with the increasing costs of production and shortage of labour. Coffee cultivation is highly labour intensive, and in the old days it was common to find three generations working on the same estate. Today, thanks to education and improved opportunities, the aspirations of the younger generation have increased, and many are moving out to urban centres in search of more profitable work. Coffee growers are finding it harder and harder to find hands to harvest their crops in the peak season, and the economics of cultivation are increasingly problematic. </P>
      <P>
        <em>The coffee landscape is as relaxing, as the drink is refreshing. </em>
        <em>Tall shade trees standing guard over coffee plants. </em>
      </P>
      <P>Good quality land for coffee cultivation is already saturated, and with increasingly stringent environment regulations that require preservation of natural resources and demarcation of no-go areas, further expansion looks improbable. Given the increase in land prices, even existing areas under cultivation closer to urban settlements would probably provide better yields through real estate development. </P>
      <P>All the more reason to preserve the coffee habitat, for if the industry suffers, the impact on the environment will be as severe as it will be on the local community. </P>
      <P>Today, India has around 2,20,000 coffee holdings, with more than 98 per cent being owned by small growers holding 10 hectares or less, micro-enterprise at its best. Estate labour accounts for over 5,35,000 persons. Factor in the number of dependants and those directly or indirectly involved with the industry and a potentially explosive picture emerges. </P>
      <P>Yet, the Indian coffee grower is a survivor, and coffee is not just a business, but a way of life! Many enlightened planters are now diversifying their activities. While coffee is still the mainstay, spice cultivation, floriculture, plantation tourism…all these are making waves in the coffee lands. The net result is that the coffee country of India is on the path to rejuvenation and greater bio-diversity – adding new dimensions, yet again, to the natural heritage. With its sustainable coffee economy, the coffee districts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are justifiably recognised as a national asset – a unique case of Nature and commerce in harmony. </P>

        <H1>Café Culture in India </H1>
      </SECTION>
      <P>The first decade of the 21st century can truly be termed the Decade of Coffee in India. The yearly domestic consumption of coffee in India rose to 94,400 tonnes in 2008, a positive change since 1998, when consumption was static at 50,000 tonnes per annum. </P>
      <P>Liberalisation of the Indian coffee industry in 1996 significantly altered the landscape for coffee growers and exporters, as well as retailers. Today, the coffee retail scene in India is thriving like never before. The growth rate in recent years is estimated at a healthy 6% per annum, bringing India squarely onto the radar of global coffee companies as a consuming, and not just a producing, country. With a consumer middle class estimated at around 350 million, it appears that India’s potential is just being realised. </P>
      <P>The most dramatic representation of Indian coffee has emerged through the cafés that today occupy practically every street corner in urban India, with the burgeoning coffee bars being identified as one of the more visible signs of a booming consumer economy. </P>
      <P>Throughout history, across continents, coffee bars have been places to talk and pass time, romance and revolutionise. India, too, has its own special café culture, spanning some three generations, with traditional and contemporary avatars. </P>

        <H4>India Coffee House – An Institution: </H4>
        <P>The golden age of the coffee house in India belongs undeniably to the India Coffee House, which had its hey day from the 1940s through the 1970s. The first India Coffee House opened on Churchgate Street in Bombay on 28th September 1936, and quickly became a rendezvous for an entire generation swept up in the political maelstrom of pre-Independent India and through to the revolutionary sixties. The outlets were part of a larger strategy to promote coffee consumption in India, and the India Coffee House chain, later operated by the Coffee Board, reached a peak of 72 outlets, before getting downsized, as the younger generation in India took to colas and carbonated drinks. </P>

        <H4>Coffee Bars – The Contemporary Scene: </H4>
        <P>A fresh new aroma wafted in during the 1990s, with a whole new trend in coffee retailing in India. Coffee bars today capture the spirit of the age, not only because of the customer profile, but also in terms of the entrepreneurial flair that is demonstrably on show. </P>
        <P>The trail of the reinvented coffee shop starts in Bangalore, the IT Capital and the Coffee Capital of India. The Café Coffee Day on Brigade Road, Bangalore happens to be the first ‘cybercafe’ in the Country, where the contemporary trend in coffee-pubbing started, and it now has a special place in the history of coffee retailing in India. Launched by the Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co. (ABC), in November 1996, the retail concept fused two distinct trends – the cyber craze and the yen for gourmet coffee – and the independent, stand-alone coffee joint, rather, cybercafé, was born. </P>
        <P>Having pioneered the modern coffee retail format in India, Café Coffee Day (CCD) has been hugely successful: as of January 2011 the company had some 1,040 outlets in India, clearly the leading coffee retailer in the Country, the third in Asia, and the fifth in the world! Café Coffee Day has also ventured overseas, and operates cafés in Vienna, Austria and Karachi. Expansion is planned across the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Egypt and South East Asia in the coming years. </P>
        <SECTION>
          <P>The word ‘Barista’ means ‘a bartender/expert in the brewing and making of coffee’, and is Italian in origin. The credit for raising the profile of coffee retailing in India goes to Barista Coffee Company, which opened shop in New Delhi in March 2000. Over the years, there have been ownership and management changes: the original promoters, Turner Morrison and Co., sold out to the Chennai-based Sterling Infotech Group; and in March 2007, Lavazza, Italy’s largest coffee company, made a strategic entry into India by taking over Barista. Currently there are over 200 Barista Lavazza Espresso Bars and Barista Crème Lavazza’s in over 30 cities in India. Barista Lavazza also has cafés in locations across Sri Lanka, Oman and the UAE. </P>
        </SECTION>
        <P>Besides the big two, CCD and Barista Lavazza, several other retailers currently liven up the coffee scene in India. There’s Costa, part of UK-based Whitbread plc, which has a franchise agreement with RJ Corporation’s subsidiary DIL in India, currently operating around 100 outlets in Indian metros; Qwiky’s which set up its first coffee pub in Chennai in October 1999, and operates on a franchise basis; Javagreen, part of the Reliance World stores of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), Coffee World, a venture of Global Franchise Architects (GFA), Cafe Mocha, with its flagship store in Mumbai’s Churchgate area, living up to its “coffees and conversations” tagline; Kalmane Koffee, a speciality roaster retailer based in Bangalore; Gloria Jean’s, the Australian coffee franchise, which is now present in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai; Italian coffee major Illycaffe which sources significant quantities of Arabica and Robusta from India, and is now partnering with the Narang group to set up its Espressamente Illy outlets – the first of which is visible at the Bengaluru International Airport, and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, US-based family-run company with an international footprint, which now has outlets in Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata. Besides the chain stores, several independents have staked out their turf in big cities, such as Moca Cafe in Chennai. </P>
        <P>The year 2011 started with a bang when US coffee chain Starbucks finally announced in January its much-awaited entry into India on the back of an alliance with Tata Coffee, an agreement which includes sourcing of green coffee beans, roasting and café operations. </P>
        <P>All these contemporary coffee chains initially had one thing in common – they all went unabashedly for young throats! The outlets are designed for young people in the age group of 15-29 to hang out – preferably for hours, no sweat. With air-conditioning and music, message boards full of wise-cracks, indoor games such as chess, scrabble and Pictionary; these pubs are virtually an extension of the college canteen, but thoroughly upscale versions. </P>
        <P>Yet, as the consumer matured, all the major coffee chains in India have experimented with and launched several other formats, catering to a wider audience, including executives and families. Interiors have been suitably adapted, with the lounge format currently in vogue. Several new cafés have come up in the new and refurbished airports in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and New Delhi, which cater to passengers in transit. </P>
        <P>Sub-continental scale makes café culture in India extremely diverse. Traditional dhabas and darshinis, the Indian version of fast food joints, co-exist alongside the new Western-style cafés. Yet for retail opportunists, it’s evident that the emerging café scene holds great promise, with franchisees said to be making a 15-20% annual profit. </P>
        <P>The twist is that coffee retailers don’t make money on the coffee service alone, as food service also plays an important role. For young people these days in India, chilling out at a coffee bar is more of a lifestyle thing, a convenient hangout. From serving snacks and short eats, mostly Western-style burgers and sandwiches, the stores have introduced soups, salads and pasta, not to mention ‘wraps’ which in essence are kaati rolls! Indianising and indigenising the menu has been crucial to increasing footfalls at these cafés. </P>
        <P>At the same time, the taste, palate and vocabulary of the Indian coffee consumer has become increasingly sophisticated, with people perfectly comfortable with ‘origins’ such as Colombia or Coorg, blends of different beans such as Arabica and Robusta, and preparations such as Italian espresso or macchiato or authentic South Indian filter coffee. Valentine’s Day is not complete without a heart shape in the coffee cup demonstrating the Barista’s proficiency in latte art, or a discerning consumer choosing to patronise a store that boasts of a particular brand of espresso machine! </P>
        <P>In the process, we’ve been witness to the evolution of the coffee house format as exemplified by the India Coffee House that served one standard house blend, to a trendy bar that serves a variety of beverages and snacks. The espresso counter is a focal element, with the full range of gourmet coffees on order. Urban youth of every new generation always tend to stake out a certain public space as their own; certainly the coffee pubs in the Indian metros are the social milieu where the bold and the beautiful get together today. Further, an Indian twist – the accent is on conviviality, on group activity – way different from the coffee pubs in the Western world which are designed for the individual wanting a quick, quiet cuppa. </P>
        <P>For young people these days, chilling out at a coffee pub is more of a lifestyle thing, and has more “added value” than simply sipping a cola or a lemon drink. The contemporary coffee bar scene in India today spells non-stop excitement! As each chain expands, each new store opening becomes a frothy celebration of India’s own brand of coffee culture. </P>

They are regular contributors to coffee-related publications and periodically present lectures on the intrinsic value of shade grown coffee. </em>
      </P>
      <P>India has been home to coffee for almost 200 years and it has always been, and still remains, shade grown. However, with the winds of globalisation and liberalisation reaching Indian shores, forest grown Indian coffee is making inroads in the West as a speciality coffee. The coffee grown under the shade of forest trees has a unique taste of Nature in the cupping quality. There are three key ideas here. This uniqueness is not only the result of the forest factor but also due to the fact that the coffee habitats are an integral part of multi-crops, herbs and spices. In addition, Indian coffee plantations harbour thousands of species of old, diverse and significant species of rare birds, insects and endangered wildlife. Nature lovers can appreciate the beauty and </P>
      <P>variety of trees by simply taking a walk inside the shade grown Indian coffee plantation. It is like walking hand in hand with nature. One can hear different species of birds singing, especially at dawn and at dusk. We are greeted with a sonata of natural sounds. The amazing fact is that coffee habitat and nature bring out the best chemistry in sustaining each other’s needs. Many foreigners who visit the plantations, remark that Indian coffee plantations are bird and game sanctuaries. The architectural detail of the coffee mountain is astounding. </P>
      <P>This article is intended to be an eye-opener, or a window to the world of coffee lovers worldwide, in allowing them to appreciate the role of Indian coffee farmers in maintaining the fragile forest cover and its inhabitants. It provides an opportunity to observe the complexity of Nature, both on the forest floor and the coffee canopy. With the unique </P>
      <P>flora and fauna, the </P>
      <P>coffee mountain allows one to experience the sights, sounds, smells and life of the forest canopy. </P>
      <P>Fifty years ago, the plantation scene was totally different. Our forefathers were sensible people. Men with vision and uncommon commonsense. They had the ‘Live and let live’ approach at the back of their mind. One could see leopards, tigers, elephants, rabbits, bison, sambar, reptiles, spotted deer, wild boars, green pigeons, and cranes, at the waterholes inside the plantation. Literally, every plantation with its extensive lakes provided a safe haven for wildlife. </P>
      <P>During the migration periods as well as during the mating season, seldom would any planter venture out hunting. Also, during the hunting season, care was taken such that the female of the species was not hunted down. Wild fruit trees were allowed to grow in the valleys along with shrubs and herbs and this thick jungle of shrubs and thorn bushes used to be the lodge as well as food baskets for wildlife. </P>
      <P>The big cats were selectively shot only because they were man eaters. Planters never killed wildlife indiscriminately. They never used to overdo things. Today the situation is pathetic. The forest itself is in trouble. The wildlife numbers have declined alarmingly due to hunting and clearing of restricted zones within the coffee forest. Deforestation and extension of plantations has also made the task of conserving that much more difficult. Migrations are earmarked as opportunities for poaching. All that remains are fragments of a once pristine wildlife habitat. </P>
      <P>Extension of coffee plantations too is an undesirable trait because it leads to mechanisation of the forest in terms of levelling and clearing of shrubs and exposing the virgin land to direct sunlight. Dr. Romulus Whitaker, a leading conservationist, is of the opinion that the Western Ghats is one of the largest unbroken pieces of forest. Cutting even a single tree in the dense Western Ghats can cause severe damage to thousands of beneficial microorganisms. The destruction of the natural environment has been rapid in the last five decades. </P>
      <SECTION>
        <H4>Environmental Crisis: </H4>
        <P>Coffee farmers are increasingly diverting their attention towards short-term profits. On the one hand, they are indiscriminately cutting native trees and on the other, replanting the soil with saplings like eucalyptus, mangium, mesopsis, acacia, delonix, feltoforum, and other species meant for the restoration of desert soils. </P>
        <P>Instead of contributing to the soil fertility they degrade the soil and also remove water from the groundwater table. In the bargain the self-supporting stability of natural forests decline. We firmly believe that the greatest threat to this fragile planet in the 21st century is the destruction of coffee forests and creation of mono-cropped forests. Imagine millions of acres of pine, eucalyptus, acacia or mangium forests. They do not support any other plant or animal life. </P>
        <P>Forest nurseries and private nurseries need to propagate the native forest trees which contribute thousands of tonnes of biomass and periodically rejuvenate the soil system. So coffee farmers need to prepare and preserve the seeds of these traditional varieties of hardwood and semi-hardwood species which act as rain harvesters and enrich the fertility status of the soil. </P>

        <H1>Coffee Forests A Gateway to Wildlife </H1>
      </SECTION>
      <P>Cradled by the verdant Western Ghats, coffee forests are an ecological wonderland, fed as they are by more than a dozen rivers, the majority, taking birth in the high ranges of the Ghats. Most of the year, except during the monsoons, you will find it tranquil, almost gentle, yet the power behind the sight is unmistakable. </P>
      <P>Amidst untamed patches of greenery one can discover coffee forests with their enchanting landscape teeming with varied flora and fauna. These coffee forests provide an incredible opportunity for the Nature lover to study hundreds of species of endangered birds and animals. The great physical variations in topography from the high-range mountains to the low-lying plains and the formation of multiple watersheds is responsible for local variation in species diversity. </P>
      <P>A study of the coffee forests reveals very interesting facts. Coffee forests have varied physical and climatic conditions and types of vegetation. Two factors play a key role in coffee forests accommodating distinctive types of flora and fauna. Most of the coffee forests are zones with an elevation ranging from 950 m MSL going up to 1500 m MSL receiving very high rainfall. These forests have three-storied vegetation accommodating multi-crops and various types of flora and fauna. </P>
      <P>The upper storey or top storey consists of tall evergreen trees which belong mostly to the hard wood species. More than 60 per cent of the sunlight is trapped by this canopy of trees. Trees of medium growth belonging to the semi-hard wood species form the middle tier. These trees grow luxuriantly in moderate shade. The third layer consists of introduced species which are not permanent in nature. This three-tiered shade system acts as a sanctuary for birds and animals of all kinds, both ground dwellers as well as tree dwellers by providing adequate food and protection. </P>
      <P>The Western Ghats, one of the eight hot spots of biodiversity in the world, are home to shade grown eco</P>
      <P>friendly coffee plantations. The exciting news is that these evergreen tropical forests are proposed to be included in the list of world heritage sites. To date there are six natural heritage sites in India which include the Valley of Flowers, the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Kaziranga National Park, Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, Sunderban and Keoladeo National Park. These spectacular ghats comprising of mountain ranges, steep valleys, rivers, rivulets and pristine forests cover an area of about 1,60,000 square km and stretch forth 1,600 km from the Southern tip at Kanyakumari to Gujarat. </P>
      <P>The Western Ghats, otherwise referred to as the Sahyadri Hills are formed by the Malabar Plains and the mountains running parallel to the West Coast of India. These pristine coffee forests are part and parcel of the massive protected Nilgiri Biosphere (5,520 square km) reserve, which is India’s first biosphere reserve. The Bandipur National Park (874 square km.) flanked by Nagarahole or Rajiv Gandhi National Park </P>
      <P>(643.39 square km), Mudhumalai Wildlife Sanctuary and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, act as places of refuge for residential and endangered species. </P>

        <P>Coffee forests provide the ideal habitat for a wide variety of rare and endemic butterfly and moth species. These evergreen forests with tall canopy trees provide filtered sunlight that is beneficial to butterflies. Different species of butterflies and moths require different host species of plants for laying eggs and carrying out their respective life-cycles. Coffee </P>

        <P>Our observations spanning two decades has clearly brought out the fact that these delicate creatures are in fact highly specialised and each species has a range and unique flight pattern. Caterpillars belonging to different species feed on a diversity of plant species. Some species specialise on eating the mature and old leaves belonging to old Robustas, others feed on young Arabica leaves and a few others on the leaves of the multi-storied crops like arecanut, pepper, cardamom, citrus and other trees. </P>

        <SECTION>
          <P>Farmers were aware of the beneficial role snakes played in the coffee ecosystem, eating rodents and smaller prey. Even though the concept of conservation is well supported by the coffee farmers, it is the modern day practices of using powerful, result-oriented chemicals that have put undue pressure on the land. Toxic chemicals have found their way into food chains. </P>
          <P>For some strange reasons, snakes have always been associated with fear in the minds of most coffee farmers. The inborn fear regarding their toxic venom plays a key role in killing most snakes, irrespective of whether they are poisonous or non-poisonous. An interesting fact is that only 150 out of 2000 species of snakes are poisonous. </P>

      <H1>Human-Elephant Conflict Inside Coffee Forests </H1>
      <P>The coffee forests in particular act as migratory corridors for the movement of elephant herds from one region to the other. </P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a growing threat of human intervention resulting in the Western Ghats suffering an annual deforestation rate of 1.16 per cent despite 15 per cent of the land area being protected as wildlife sanctuaries. Due to timber logging and rampant poaching for ivory, the forest itself is in trouble. The elephant range has become more and more fragmented. </P>
      <P>Wild elephants are increasingly shifting base from the core of the forest and taking sanctuary inside shade grown eco-friendly coffee plantations because their habitat is being continuously depleted. The Indian elephant is facing increasing pressure from a variety of threats like lack of food, shelter and territory. In the final analysis, the endless search for food is the beginning of conflict. </P>

          <H4>Eco-friendly Coffee: </H4>
        </SECTION>
        <P>The fact of the matter is that mono-cropping is the exception in Indian coffee plantations. The rule is a range of simultaneously growing crops. No other plantations in the world have the range of diversity as that seen in Indian coffee plantations. Pepper vines are grown on shade trees; cardamom, arecanut, ginger, orange, citrus, vanilla and a few other spices are grown as multiple crops inside the coffee plantations. Rice and bananas are commercially grown in the valleys. Most of these crops are not only ideal food for elephants but more importantly have higher nutritive content and palatability. These multiple crops act as powerful magnets attracting herds of wild elephants into eco-friendly coffee farms. This leads to negative interactions between humans and elephants, commonly referred to as the ‘human-elephant conflict’. </P>
        <P>Primary conflict includes crop raiding, and competition between humans and elephants for vegetation. Elephants are known to spend about three-quarters of their time, day and night, selecting, picking, preparing and eating food. An adult elephant in the wild will eat in the region of 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb.) of vegetation per day depending on the habitat and the size of the elephant. </P>
        <P>The number of plant species eaten by any one elephant may vary but it is likely to be more than fifty. </P>
        <P>In fact, competition has defined the eating habits of elephants. Each herd needs its own territory to survive. Elephants are not territorial, but they inhabit a particular area if food supply there is in abundance. They also make use of the existing migratory corridors to go from one forest range to the other. Unlike most other mammals, elephant migration consists of a series of migrations in the quest for food. This migratory map is passed on by the matriarch to subsequent generations through the trials of life. Research also indicates that elephant home ranges vary from population to population and habitat to habitat. Individual home ranges vary from 15 to 3700 square km. </P>
        <SECTION>
          <P>In the early 1960s, elephant numbers were pretty stable because of the better protection and the availability of plenty of food within the confines of the evergreen forests. However, with the advent of modern technology (timber cranes, electric chain saws, bulldozers,etc.) the forest landscape has changed for the worse. A good network of roads leads to the heart of the forests making it that much easier for the poachers. All these factors have a direct impact on the sustainability of the elephant population. </P>
          <P>We have witnessed widespread conflicts between elephants and humans inside eco-friendly coffee farms. Our observations (20 years) point out to the fact that the conflict is getting out of hand resulting in the destruction of crops on one side and the death and decline of these magnificent gentle giants on the other. Something needs to be done on a war-footing to conserve these endangered elephants and alleviate the sufferings of the subsistence farmers. </P>

          <H4>Why The Need to Conserve? </H4>
        </SECTION>
        <P>Coffee forests provide key breeding landscapes for umbrella species like tigers and elephants. Umbrella species need large areas to live in. Protection of these species results in the protection of other smaller species both at the macro and micro level. Each species is indispensable for the survival of the other. This has a direct impact on the sustainability and biodiversity of the coffee mountain. The conservation of the Indian elephant also has many indirect and direct benefits. In spite of their size, elephants never overgraze and scientific evidence points out that elephant corridors are rich in biodiversity. Areas rich in biodiversity, in turn aid in the establishment of a healthier eco-system. </P>

        </SECTION>
        <P>Shimanta Kumar Goswami, a Nature lover from Assam has developed a simple innovative and cost-effective early warning system that not only alerts farmers about straying jumbos, but also drives them back into the forest. The early warning system uses strong, two plus nylon ropes, a few poles and an alarm bell. The rope is tied to the poles, at a height of about 6 feet and the poles are fixed to the ground at a gap of 200 meters. This network connects to an electric bell on a watch tower. As the elephant comes in contact with the nylon rope, the hair on its head gets caught between the plies of the rope and the resultant tension pulls the hair out. Instinctively, the elephant turns away and simultaneously, the alarm bells are triggered warning the villagers. </P>
        <P>The cost to cover a km with this device is around $ US 50, whereas devices using electric fencing cost approximately $ US 3000. </P>

        <H4>Traditional Coffee Growing Regions of India: </H4>
        <P><em>The Anamalais </em>(located on the southern tip of the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu) with an elevation ranging from 1000-1400 m MSL (mean sea-level) and a rainfall of 2500-3000 mm is the abode of spotted leopards. This region grows some of the finest high grown Arabicas, including the exotic Kents. In addition to thick forests, the Anamalais have extensive grass lands tapering towards fertile valleys which provide an ideal breeding ground for spotted leopards. </P>
        <P><em>The Bababudangiris</em>, the birthplace of coffee in India in the state of Karnataka with an elevation ranging from 1000-1500 m MSL and a rainfall of 1750-2200 mm is full of spotted deer. These hill ranges are home to the finest Arabica milds. The main varieties cultivated are S-795, Selection-9, and Cauvery. The terrain consists of a chain of hills with rolling grass lands. </P>
        <P><em>The Biligiris</em>, one of the highest coffee growing regions in India with an elevation ranging from 1500-2000 m MSL and a rainfall of 1100-1200 mm is noted for the sambar -the largest Indian deer with huge antlers. This region on the border of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is home to full-bodied Arabicas. The main varieties grown are the S-795, </P>
        <P>Selection-9, and Cauvery. </P>
        <P><em>The Chikmagalur </em>region in Karnataka with an elevation ranging from 700-1200 m MSL and a rainfall of 1000-4500 mm supports many wildlife sanctuaries. Chikmagalur’s forests and wildlife sanctuaries are abundant with peacocks, India’s national bird. This region grows both the Arabica and Robusta varieties of coffee. The Arabica varieties include S-795, selection 5B and Cauvery. The Robusta varieties include Peridenia, S-274 and CxR. </P>
        <P>The Chikmagalur coffee forests are unique with undulating topography. High-rise </P>
        <P>mountains and steep valleys is the characteristic feature of this region. At the base of the mountains are extensive grass lands dotted with patches of dense forests, providing shelter to sambar, gaur, tigers, elephants and leopards. </P>
        <P><em>The Coorg (Kodagu) </em>region with an elevation ranging from 750-1100 m MSL and a rainfall of 1000-2500 mm is famous for different species of honey bees. In fact Coorg honey sold by nimble-footed tribals has many medicinal qualities. The region has both the tropical </P>
        <P>moist deciduous to dry deciduous and scrub forests depending on the precipitation </P>
        <P>of rainfall. South Coorg which houses the Nagarahole National park has teak as the predominant species. The main varieties grown here are: S.795, Sln.6 and Sln.9 varieties of Arabica and S.274, CxR varieties of Robusta. </P>
        <P><em>The Manjarabad </em>region, sandwiched between Kodagu and Chikmagalur in Karnataka, with an elevation of 900-1100 m MSL and a rainfall of 1000-2500 mm is the natural habitat of the jungle fowl. The spectacular plumage of the male bird and its long colourful tail is indeed a pretty sight. The forests are composed of tall trees forming close canopies. The undergrowth has bamboo and cane on wet ground. </P>
        <P><em>The Nilgiris </em>region in Tamil Nadu with an elevation of 900-1400 m MSL and a rainfall of 1600-2600 mm is the ideal habitat for the spotted leopard. The dominant trees shed their leaves in the rainy season and spring forth a rich canopy during summer, keeping the environs cool. </P>
        <P><em>The Pulneys </em>region adjoining the famous Kodaikanal hill resort in Tamil Nadu, with an elevation of 600-2000 m MSL and a rainfall of 1000-1600 mm is home to one of the rarest flowers in the world, namely the bright, blue bell like Kurinji flower. This rare flower makes a dramatic appearance, once in 12 years. The tree canopy in these forests is uneven. Even though the forest consists of a large number of diverse species of trees, the canopy is not very dense. </P>
        <P><em>The Shevaroys </em>region, a popular tourist destination in Tamil Nadu, with an elevation of 9001500 m MSL and a rainfall of 800-1500 mm is famous for the Indian bison or Gaur which denotes vigour and strength. The forests are moderately dense and support shrubs, herbs and climbers. </P>
        <P><em>The Travancore </em>region in southern Kerala with an elevation of 400-1600 m MSL and a rainfall of 2000-4000 mm is dotted with the Indian national flower -the Lotus. These bright fragrant flowers with floating leaves and long stems grow in shallow waters and symbolise purity and beauty. </P>
        <P><em>The Wayanaad </em>region in northern Kerala, with an elevation of 600-900 m MSL and a rainfall of 1100-1200 mm is home to the majestic tiger -India’s national animal. The forests are pretty dense and support big game. </P>

        <H4>Non-Traditional Coffee Growing Regions: </H4>
        <P><em>The Araku valley region </em>comprising the tribal areas in the picturesque Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, is emerging as a newly developing coffee region. The Arabica coffee plantations provide a welcome green cover to otherwise barren hills. Silver Oak trees with pepper vines are a common sight in the predominantly small coffee holdings. The coffees of this region have medium to sharp acidity and intense aroma with a spicy tinge. Home to colourful parrots, it is not unusual to see a flock of chattering red and green birds, darting through trees in the scenic Araku valley. </P>

        <P><em>The Brahmaputra </em>region in the North-Eastern part of India with an elevation of 800-1200 m MSL and a rainfall of 1500-2000 mm, houses the famous Kaziranga National Park, which protects the endangered one-horned rhino. The main coffee grown consists of the Arabica milds (S-795, Cauvery). Though only small quantities of Arabicas are produced, the coffees have distinct features in the cup, with medium to full body, a characteristic fruity note, mild acidity and pleasant aroma. </P>

        <H4>Coffee Varieties -Arabica and Robusta </H4>
        <P>Coffee plants come in two main varieties – Arabica, which grows better in higher elevations, and Robusta, which grows mostly at lower levels. </P>
        <P>Arabica beans are mild in the cup, with comparatively less caffeine, while Robusta has more strength and is used in blends to provide body to the cup. Arabica is more aromatic and have higher market value compared to Robusta beans. Arabica requires more care and nurture, and is more suitable for large holdings. </P>
        <P>Robusta grows at lower altitudes. Robusta berries ripen a couple of months later than Arabica. </P>

        <P>Speciality coffees are high quality coffees that differ from normal coffee in quality. Speciality coffees are getting increasingly popular in the world coffee market and are distinguished by their origin, unique cultivation practices, special processing, etc. </P>
        <P>Consumers have come to appreciate gourmet coffees in their discerning cups. These coffees have a personality, aura, and branding of their own, fetching bigger bucks for the grower! It makes sense to grow and sell speciality coffee. </P>
        <P>India offers several varieties of speciality coffees that are popular in the West. Indian scientists have identified some of the strains that will make finer coffees with added flavour profiles, in both Arabica and Robusta varieties. </P>

        <H4>Monsooned Coffee: </H4>
        <P>‘Monsooning’ was discovered quite by accident in the 1950s when coffee beans, shipped from the ports of the Malabar coast, travelled to Europe during the monsoon and were found to have become swollen due to moisture in the air. This produced a distinct lingering mellow flavour, which has since become popular, especially in the Scandinavian countries. </P>
        <P>Even today, India offers the same golden quality Monsooned Coffee. Prepared by the unique natural elements of yesteryears and the special process of today, the Monsooned Coffee still has the monsooned flavour, mellow taste and golden look. </P>
        <P>Nowadays, the process of monsooning is carried out at curing works on the Malabar and Konkan coast bordering the Arabian Sea. For preparing monsooned coffee, only dry processed Arabica and Robusta beans are used. The best grade in monsooned coffee is Monsooned Malabar AA (Arabica). The Monsooned Malabaar Arabica and Monsooned Malabaar Robusta are the registered Geographic Indications (GIs) in India. </P>

      <H1>The Perfect Cup of South Indian Filter Coffee </H1>

She is a widely published writer, who has contributed to books, articles and columns in leading newspapers and magazines. A popular radio jockey who created the iconic characters Lingo Leela and Sister Stella, Priya now works as an independent writer, anchor and voice-artiste. </em>
      </P>
      <P>When Napoleon Bonaparte famously said “I would rather suffer with coffee than be senseless”, little did he know that halfway across the globe, there would be a legion of people who had already pledged their allegiance to the same dictum. If coffee is touted as an intelligent drink, India probably vindicates this fact with its fair share of intellectuals. The rest of the world may sip a different brew, but good coffee in India is defined by the typical South Indian Filter Coffee. Hot, strong, sweet and topped with bubbly froth, <em>‘filter kaapi’ </em>as it is popularly known has been a way of life in India for centuries. </P>
      <P>Cappuccino, its fashionable counterpart triggered the coffee bar revolution in India only in the 1990s. Before the proliferation of hip up-market coffee shops like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Java City, Barista, Gloria Jeans or Café Coffee Day in Indian metros, it was the iconic India Coffee House and multitude of smaller cafés that catered to the caffeine fix of the great Indian populace, outside the comfort of home. </P>
      <P>Even today, if you walk into any bylane at the break of dawn, the unmistakable aroma of filter coffee and the mellifluous voice of M.S. Subbulakshmi’s music drifts out of hotels and homes. And once you have had an invigorating cuppa, it is tough to go back to the bilge that is sometimes passed off as coffee. Prepared from a blend of chicory and dark brown roasted coffee beans (Arabica or Robusta) procured from the hilly slopes of the Western Ghats, filter coffee holds a huge chunk of the Country’s coffee market. So what makes South Indian Coffee so distinct? More importantly, how do you prepare the perfect cup of coffee? </P>
      <P>The answer lies in what goes into a beautiful metal device called the Coffee Filter – fresh ground coffee beans mixed with a percentage of chicory, the common coffee additive that gives good body to the flavor with its dash of bitterness. The antique brass coffee filter itself is somewhat of an heirloom passed on from one generation to the next. Today, you have a whole range of designs and sizes to choose from while buying a coffee filter – from steel filters to modern swankier options. The daily ritual of making coffee </P>
      <P>is nothing short of an art that has to be honed to perfection. </P>
      <P>Basically,allfiltersservethesamepurpose– tomaketheperfectdecoction.Thetraditionalfilterisa cylindrical metal column comprising two metal cups, placed one above the other. The base of the upper chamber is perforated and rests snugly in the other “tumbler” cup, with enough room underneath to collect the brewed coffee. The upper cup has 2 detachable parts – a pierced pressing disc with a stem handle in the centre and a lid at the top. </P>
      <P>Once the upper cup is loaded with fresh ground coffee (80%-90% mixed with chicory 10%-20%), the powder is gently pushed down with the stemmed disc to compress the grounds into a compact layer on the perforated section. Ideally, a medium to fine grind is used for making filter coffee. In a traditional coffee filter, approximately 2 heaped tablespoons of coffee ground can prepare a decoction that serves 6 medium sized </P>
      <P>cups. Water that has come to a boil is then poured over the stemmed disc and the upper cup is covered with the lid. The contents are left to stand. Since chicory helps to retain or hold water a little longer, it enables the water to extract and absorb more flavour from the ground coffee. This makes the South Indian brew a lot stronger than the Western version of drip-style coffee. Ideally, if the coffee brew is allowed to drip naturally, it will slowly collect in the lower container. It would take approximately 45 minutes for all the water to strain. </P>
      <P>No matter what blend of coffee you like or which equipment you use, the goal of making coffee is the same to release the coffee oils and soluble coffee compounds into the decoction for the final beverage. The optimum amount of mass to be extracted from the ground coffee is about 20% and proper brewing ensures that not too much tannin is released into the decoction. Elsewhere in the world, Drip Coffee or Filter coffee is prepared by allowing water to pass through the coffee powder by gravity alone and not under pressure of forced long-term contact with water. </P>
      <P>Usually, about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the collected potent brew is enough to stir up a good cup of coffee in a tumbler or cup of hot milk. Sugar is then added to taste. Quite often, the trick is to avoid stirring the coffee and milk. Typically, piping hot milk is poured over the brew and the sweetener is added. This mixture is then blended together by deftly pouring it back and forth between a steel tumbler called “lotaa” and a lipped bowl called “dabarah”. This swift action of pouring the brew in streams of wide arcs, has a trifold role to play – firstly, it helps to cool down the coffee, secondly, it mixes all the ingredients evenly and thirdly, it works up a rich bubbly foam head above the coffee, without any dilution; much like the action of a steam wand used to make frothing cappuccino. </P>
      <P>It was probably the skill of the person who stretched the distance between the tumbler and bowl to about a metre, while pouring the brew without spilling the contents which helped South Indian Filter Coffee earn another moniker – Metre Coffee. Another typical phrase in South India is “By-two coffee” which literally means “one coffee divided by two”. Clearly, the convenient division of drink could be attributed to the social role of coffee – where two individuals can enjoy a shared sense of bonhomie or perhaps, indicate a draining wallet. </P>
      <P>The debate whether coffee should be listed among the Top 10 Feel Good drinks of the world or lauded as a creative and cerebral stimulant or reviled as a health hazard may rage on for decades… At the end of the day, the way you prefer your coffee is a matter of personal taste. By and large, a good cup of traditional South Indian filter coffee is made using Plantation A or Peaberry coffee bean varieties, with the former being considered slightly inferior. In the old days, most South Indian households preferred jaggery or honey to white sugar. </P>
      <P>In fact, the use of granulated sugar as a sweetener began in the mid-20<SPAN><Sup>th </Sup></SPAN>century. Today, brown sugar (not the drug) and sugar-free tablets are regarded as the healthier options. However, most European coffee connoisseurs and purists do not advocate the addition of milk, cream or sweetener to their coffee. </P>
      <P>Finally, the appreciation of coffee has gone beyond the satisfying “mmmmm” or “aaaah” after the first sip. It has evolved from a personal habit in individual homes, to a social culture popularised by large chain café bars and outlets and more recently, to a global speciality coffee movement called the Third Wave Coffee. The humble brown beverage now relishes the same niche status as high brow forms of culinary appreciation like wine, tea, and chocolate. Not bad, for a little brown seed that suffered an identity crisis of being a fruit, a cherry, a berry and a bean in its lifetime. In the end, it’s just coffee. </P>

        <H4>The Golden Rules of Coffee Making: </H4>
        <ol>
          <LI>The coffee grind – The particle size of the coffee grounds can vary typically from granular to small in the following manner: coarse, medium, fine and espresso (or very fine). Over-extraction can occur if the grind size is too small and could result in the coffee being bitter and too strong. If the granules are too large, under-extraction could leave you with a weak coffee. A coarse grind can be used for a coffee pot, medium grind for a cafeteria (French Press), medium to fine for a typical filter drip machine and super fine grind for an espresso machine. </LI>
          <LI>Freshness and amount of coffee – Coffee beans must be stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. Long exposure to moisture or atmosphere will cause ground coffee or powder to lose its subtle flavors and aromas. Using less coffee than the recommended amount for an extended brewing time will result in an over-extracted brew. An under-extracted coffee is the consequence of using more than the recommended coffee for a shorter infusion time. </LI>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <LI>Temperature of water – Pure filtered water that has just come off the boil should be used. Ideally, hot water (95-98 degrees Celsius) is used for optimum extraction of coffee. Boiling water can scald the coffee and the outcome of cool water is under-extraction. </LI>
          <LI>Infusion time – The duration for which the hot water remains in direct contact with the coffee grounds is a crucial factor. This is determined by the equipment used for brewing. Roughly, 10-30 seconds for espresso grind 3-6 minutes for fine grind 6-8 minutes for medium grind 8-10 minutes for coarse grind. </LI>
          <LI>Brewing method – Basically there are three different methods employed to make coffee </LI>
        </ol>
        <P>a) Steep and strain – This method simply involves putting hot water in contact with coffee grounds in a pot or container until under extraction has occurred. The resulting brew is strained to isolate the coffee liquor. </P>
        <P>b) Filter infusion – This method employs a filter basket filled with coffee grounds that has hot water added from above. The infusion time is short as the water infuses briefly with the coffee until the liquor passes through the basket into a flask or container below. </P>
        <P>c) Pressure infusion – The standard method where hot water is forced under high pressure though a small tablet of compacted grounds to produce a single serving of espresso. </P>
        <P>Don’t heat the coffee after mixing with decoction. If you store the decoction in a refrigerator, re-heat it separately by placing the container with coffee in boiling water. Cold coffee can also be prepared by using this decoction. </P>
        <P>6. Cleanliness – Coffee contains oils that leave a tarry residue on equipment used to brew it. This can contaminate and ruin the taste of subsequent brews. Keeping all equipment washed and cleaned is crucial to preparing the perfect cup of coffee. Filters with tiny holes tend to get blocked, so make sure the holes are clear. The filter should be completely dry when you add the powder. </P>

        <H4>The Many Flavoured World of Coffee : </H4>
        <P>If you wish to go beyond South Indian Coffee and try something different, the coffee bars offer quite a choice on the menu. Here’s a sampler of the most popular coffee beverages : <em>Caffe (Espresso) </em>— A small cup of very strong black coffee i.e., espresso, had at any time of the day. <em>Caffe Americano</em>—American-style coffee, but stronger; though weaker than espresso and served in a large cup. <em>Caffe Doppio </em>— Double espresso. <em>Caffe Freddo </em>— Italian iced coffee or a cold version of a cappuccino (with a cold frothed milk topping). <em>Caffe Hag </em>— Decaffeinated coffee. <em>Caffe Latte </em>— Hot milk mixed with coffee and served in a glass for breakfast. <em>Caffe Macchiato </em>— Espresso “stained” with a drop of steamed milk or a mini cappuccino, if you like <em>Caffe Marocchino </em>— Espresso with a dash of hot milk and cocoa powder </P>
        <P><em>Caffe Mocha </em>– The American equivalent of the Italian or French Mocha Latte. Like a caffe latte, caffe mocha is typically (one third) 1/3 espresso and (two thirds) 2/3 steamed milk with a dash of chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder or chocolate syrup. Mocha can contain dark or milk chocolate. Like cappuccino, caffe mocha contains the well-known milk froth on top, although they are sometimes served with whipped cream and usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder. Marshmallows provide added flavor and decoration. </P>
        <P><em>Cappuccino </em>— Italy’s famous morning drink -an espresso infused with steamed milk and froth, ideally not drunk after lunch or dinner. <em>Granita di caffe con Panna </em>— Frozen, iced beverage (similar to a slush, but crushed ice makes it authentic) topped with whipped cream. <em>Turkish Coffee </em>– Served short like espresso, it is almost the same measure of ground coffee as an espresso, added to water and brought to a boil. Ground cardamom is added to the blend of coffee to perk the flavor. <em>Kopi luwak or Civet coffee </em>– The world’s most expensive, low-production coffee made from the beans of coffee berries found in the scat of Asian Palm Civet and other civets. The civet eats the berries for their fleshy pulp. As the berries pass through its digestive tract, proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans. The beans are finally excreted, but retain their shape. They are gathered, washed thoroughly, sun dried and light roasted before brewing. Kopi luwak beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness and is still rated as the most expensive coffee in the world! Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago, in the Philippines and East Timor. </P>

        <H4>Strange Brew: The Story of Irish Coffee </H4>
        <P>Talk about a storm in a coffee cup! Here’s an interesting nugget for those who love their tipple. It might sound like an ancient recipe, but Irish Coffee was a 20th Century invention. This unique rich brew was born on a cold winter’s eve in 1942 at an airbase in Limerick, Ireland. What started out as a panacea to calm down and warm up stranded airline passengers caught in a freezing storm, went down in history as one of the best ways to sip coffee! </P>
        <P>The story goes that a flight full of American passengers was recalled to Foynes Airbase (now Shannon International Airport) after braving heavy storms for many hours. Mercifully, the flight landed safely but the panic-stricken passengers were cold and wretched in the icy night air. Joseph Sheridan, the chef at the airbase terminal restaurant took one look at them and decided to whip up a concoction that would warm their bodies and their spirits. He brewed some hot coffee and added a splash of good Irish whiskey to it. The travellers loved it. When one of them asked whether it was Brazilian coffee, Chef Sheridan famously replied, “No, that’s Irish coffee.” Today, you can savour the original Irish Coffee drink at Joe Sheridan Café Bar in the airport, where a plaque marks his achievement. </P>

        <H4>Authentic Irish Coffee Recipe: </H4>
        <P>1 measure or shot (2 ounces) Irish whiskey 3 sugar cubes (1 & 1/2 heaping teaspoons granulated sugar)* Strong black coffee 2 teaspoons heavy or whipping cream </P>
        <P>* Some recipes use brown sugar. </P>
        <P>Heat a stemmed whiskey goblet (7-ounce coffee cup or goblet may be substituted) with boiling water so that it is good and hot. Pour in 1 shot of whiskey and add the sugar cubes. Fill with strong black coffee to within 1 inch of the top; stir gently until sugar is dissolved. </P>
        <P>Top with thick, fresh cream. Pour the liquid cream over the back of a teaspoon held just above the coffee’s surface. Gradually raise the spoon as you slowly pour the cream. This will result in a layer of liquid cream that floats on top of the coffee. Drinking the coffee through the layer of cream results in the rich, authentic flavor that coffee’s drinkers originally enjoyed. Do not stir. Irish coffee is best enjoyed by sipping the coffee through the cream. Makes 1 serving. </P>
