        <H2>Publisher’s Note </H2>
        <P>It is our privilege that during the 150<SPAN><Sup>th </Sup></SPAN>year of Swami Vivekananda’s birth, we are publishing this wonderful title “Pay for Excellence and get Success, Wealth and Fame all free of cost” by Shri A. R. K. Sarma. </P>
        <P>Shri Sarma, an ardent devotee of the Ramakrishna Mutt, has been doing a yeoman service to the society in general and the youth in particular by meticulously bringing to the front, the message of Swami Vivekananda, in a very simple and lucid style. He very carefully relates the Swamiji’s thoughts to most modern, contemporary views on Management and Self-development. </P>
        <P>“Don’t look back - forward, infinite energy, infinite enthusiasm, infinite daring, and infinite patience -then alone can great deeds be accomplished”, so says Swami Vivekananda. Shri Sarma takes us through a repertoire of such thoughts and deeds in his writings. </P>
        <P>PRISM is pleased to be publishing this work and hope to do more in the series with the support of Shri Sarma. It is a </P>
        <P>th</P>
        <P>matter of pride for PRISM, that during the 150 year of the Swamiji, we are embarking on a project to translate Swamiji’s works from Bengali into Kannada. We hope that the readers will enjoy and benefit from these works. </P>
