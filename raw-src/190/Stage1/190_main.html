It may be said that the main reason for this is because the word “Culture” in English is being used a lot and has gained currency in modern usage.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The word “Culture” in English in today’s context and meaning is being used since about a hundred years. Its use has attained additional significance especially in the last fifty years, gradually. After the United Nations was born (1945) the use of this word is abundant. In 1946, when the UNESCO was formed, the word “Culture” was incorporated in its very name and gave it an authoritative place. The Indian Government has hoisted the flag of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Then what is the meaning of this word which has such an influential position?</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Nobody has yet authoritatively defined the meaning of the word. In parlance, there are many loose meanings. A society of scholars has not brought it to a conclusive stage. If you look at the history of such a society, in its discussion of this question, instead of solving the question, it looks as though a fresh generation has got an argument to contend with.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2    /    sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.    Gundappa</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Some people may feel that the special feature of culture is that it has not come under any restriction. Since it has remained so “shapeless” anybody can use it in any situation to complete a sentence. When at the beginning of a lecture when a word or idea with a definite specific meaning does not suggest itself, the lecturer when he brings forth “Culture”, the audience (or the readers) get the impression that something profound is being said. By the very word “Culture” the ear hears something of importance. Culture, Freedom, Equality, Fraternity, Dharma – etc. are the terminology of creating impressiveness. The meaning of these words can be expanded or contracted at will and an indescribable aura can be brought about. Such clichés are the saving friends of a speech-maker. When there is no other helper, these are of use.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Nobody will say that the word “Culture” has no meaning. Not only does it have a meaning; but its meaning is very extensive, many faceted and very important for our lives. Though no authoritative statement or a definitive dictionary give an explanation of its meaning, we can understand the meaning of that word through its use by the learned people. The meaning of so many quintessential words which are in our daily use cannot be easily explained in precise terminology. What is “Man”? What is “Truth”? What is “Dharma”? These questions are easily asked but difficult to be answered. We can recognize the animal called Man. We can point it out by our finger. But difficult to explain in so many words. Still there are answers. To get to know them is possible by effort. Let us find out by consideration and discussion.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 141pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Etymology</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h4 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">W<span class="p">hile discussing the influence of education or while talking about the good nature and conduct of cultivated people, the word “Culture” makes its appearance as an adjunct. This word does not seem to have been in use in ancient works. But its related synonym “Samskara” is in early use. Expressions like “Sixteen Samskaras”, the “Samskara” of intellect etc. are familiar to everyone. The language which has “samskara” is “Samskrita”. Similarly the man who has a sound educational training is a “Samskrita”. This is the past usage.</span></h4><P style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The wealth of good qualities of a “Samskrita” is “Samskriti”. In this sense, the word “Samskriti” is coming into increased use in Kannada now for the past fifteen to twenty years. This is an essential word. When a new word is coming into use among us, it means that a new idea is entering into our life. A new word for a new idea or feeling. Actually rather than calling it a new feeling, it is better to think of it as a revived idea. Now it is coming into memory; something old which had gone out of sight is coming back with a shine and a new resplendence. This shows the animation of that object. That being the case it is essential to the fulfillment of our life.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">That quality or characteristic of man which we are proclaiming as “Samskriti”, in this sense the English word “Culture” has also come into common parlance only recently – since about a hundred and fifty years. The origin of the word culture is “Cult” or “Cultus” in Latin. The original meaning of the word was along the lines of “elevated”, “enlightened”, “show</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4    /    sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.    Gundappa</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">respect”, “serve”, “refinement”, “development”, “improvement”, “dedication” and such – from this gradually arose two meanings–</P><P style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1) “theism” – acceptance of religious belief, etc. (2) the worship of the earth, interest in land, agriculture, cultivation, etc. From the second meaning came “Agriculture”. Gradually, from this came cultivation of land, growing produce and words like “horticulture” (gardening), arboriculture (growing trees and bushes), etc. Further along came “sericulture” (rearing silk worms), “pissiculture” (fisheries) and words like that. By keeping on expanding, the study of bacteria gave raise to “bacteriological culture” and the meaning – manufacture of artificial pearls, etc. In recent times, especially in America, the word refers to the social organizations of various races, the matrimonial and other forms of practices, the conduct of the family, the customs and manners of eating and etiquette modes of social behaviour and the style of living came to be referred to. About a hundred years ago (1867) “Culture” came to signify a man’s intellectual cultivation, the superiority of the mind and the inner development. Thus “Culture” has come to signify the sophistication and refinement attained through literature, music, painting, sculpture and such other arts. This superior artistic temperament came to be known as “Culture”. Now about eighty years ago (1869), the English scholar – poet, Mathew Arnold, in his lengthy essay “Culture and Anarchy” has discussed the mental attitudes and propensities of three classes of people in the English society of that time which appeared prominent to him. (1) those who are born rich are “barbarians”. (2) the middle-class people who are interested in money – matters and bodily comforts are the “philistines”. (3) The poor people who are busy in day-to- day existence are the “populace”. Arnold’s complaint is that in none of these three is found the taste for culture as all these were not supporters of spiritual values. Let us look at Bhartrihari’s statement.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Culture is not mere education, it is the pollen of the flower of education. It is a totally satisfying conduct and character born</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Etymology / 5</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">out of the wedlock of literary sensibility and discrimination of worldly wisdom; it is the sum total or the end product of the comparative knowledge of various subjects, various aspirations and goods, various philosophical standpoints, and various religious beliefs. That is the gentle and sophisticated softness, good behaviour and respectful attitude of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture is not mere scholarship. A man may learn a dozen languages; may have read hundreds of books; he may have at his finger tips grammars and dictionaries. But by only this he cannot be considered a “Cultured” person.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture is not mere knowledge or the mastery over scientific information about physical things and substances. A man may have traveled in many countries; he may have transacted business with hundreds of people. He may have put into his store – house of memory information of a thousand things collected from various sources like books on geography, history, government reports and newspapers. But this collection, by itself cannot become “Culture”.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Mere cleverness and shrewdness is not “Culture” either. A man may converse with astonishing wit, he may be an expert in logic and make his opponent accept defeat by using ingenious arguments. Being careful and patient in carrying out works with planning and smoothness, one can win victory. Even this is not culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Music and such other taste for art which are learnt is not culture. A man may identify various ragas; one can criticize the strength and weakness of the strokes of a painting; one can discuss the proportions of a sculptural piece; one can be an expert actor. From these things one can not prove that he is cultured.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">He may be good speaker, may have mastery of speech, he may cite poetry and proverbs in conversation; he may narrate</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6    /    sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.    Gundappa</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">anecdotes, he may show dexterity in dialogue; None of these constitute the inner core of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Then, what is Culture? From refinement comes culture. Refinement or ‘Samskarana’ – ‘Samyak Karana’ – “Samyak Kriti” comes “Samskriti” or culture, which means doing well, making something beautiful, refining something, cleaning of something and making it good. “Good” means a substance or subject matter is the way it should be. That is “Good” when the ultimate goal of life is brought closer in an object or behaviour, that is pleasing and convenient. That is, propriety. That is, genuineness. The effort to find that “Good” – the search for that beauty, that truth</P><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">is culture. The means and method by which what is pleasant and meaningful is brought into our lives, this method is culture. In our various contacts and interactions with the world, the propriety that we create is culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Isn’t beauty a condition, a state, that everybody desires everywhere? We wash ourselves and bedeck ourselves with ornaments. We get our houses painted. We search for beauty for whatever we see. Similarly don’t we need certain elegance in our worldly relationships? Those behavioural patterns are culture. It is the beauty of feeling, a beauty of conduct. That living creature who doesn’t wear that ornament is a forest animal. Just as we try to make our home and health clean, so must we consciously strive to make our relationship with the world beautiful. This alone is the sum total of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The orderly cleanliness of word and deed is culture. Cleanliness means taking out all dirt. So the work of culture is rubbing off the dirt of the mind and washing it away.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The discrimination between right and wrong, the suitable and the unsuitable in our daily situations is an aspect of culture; Another aspect is judging the value of things and their priorities;</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Etymology / 7</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">yet another aspect is the awareness of other people’s aims and intentions; another aspect is taste in simplicity; yet another is awareness of the stabilizing force of Dharma / right conduct. Another aspect is the soul – searching self realization. Thus culture is the result of the integration resulting in bringing together disparate kinds of knowledge and different kinds of disciplines.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This achievement of the fruition of life is through inner cultivation. The different facets of this cultivation are – study of books, dedication to the arts and the company of Connoisseurs There is no opposition between scholarship and culture. There is no enmity between sharpness of mind and culture. There is place in culture for scholarship, brilliance and sharpness of intellect. But this by itself cannot constitute culture. Culture is the end product of the inner consciousness. This product requires several ingredients. No one of these can call itself culture by itself.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture and Progress – both these words have the same intention originally. The superior life – that great concept holds up each side through each word. That which – improves life is culture; that which leads to improvement is progress. In ordinary parlance, the purification of the inner being is culture – the dexterity of morality, ethics, finesse and efficiency. Progress consists of the methodical, proper working for the intended goal and purpose, in bringing about comfort, convenience and wealth. Primarily, culture belongs to the individual, progress to the society.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Both these concepts are contained in Dharma – Dharma is holding together bearing and wearing. That is Dharma which valuable life is wearing. What is it that which is the adhesive integrating force? It is that unchanging, Eternal Entity which has three components – (1) The individual or self (2) The surrounding world which appears (3) Iswara or God or the Lord.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8    /    sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

Thus each individuality or natural and true remembrance of the lord of the universe, for the sake of attaining a vision of Him through co-operating with the life of the universe through the flowering forth of natural and authentic quality – that is Dharma.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">One face of Dharma is the Philosophy that promotes spiritual progress; the other face, the knowledge of science which makes for worldly progress; yet another face is the fine – art of living; - culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 6pt;text-align: left;">The Words of Mathew Arnold</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">L<span class="p">et us listen to the words of Mathew Arnold, an experienced person in this field. The attempt to make every situation in life, relevant, proper and meaningful through our attitude and action is culture. He says –</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">‘‘Culture’’ moves inspired not merely by the desire of purely scientifically discriminatory understanding of information of the mind, but it is also inspired by the strong force of social welfare and the desire for right conduct and beliefs.’’ According to Bishop Wilson, the defining sentence reads –</P><P style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Making Wisdom and the will of God strong in the World’.</P><P style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A delicate aspect should not be forgotten here. It is possible that while in our enthusiasm to do good and examining what is God’s will, we may lose our caution and be misled. When our desire for the good is keen, our mind will be action bound. Then we will not have enough patience to give enough attention to the critical examination of the subject. Therefore whatever our mind sees as relevant, we carry out in action these half-baked immature ideas. But this is not a characteristic of Culture. In culture, in addition to the desire to do good, the desire for knowledge is also intermixed. What is wisdom? What is the will of God? Culture requires a sound understanding in these matters. It cannot tolerate un-researched ideas. Culture accepts the fact that any action, any arrangement cannot last and cannot be beneficial unless it has the foundation of discriminatory</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

That is why, even in the most sacred ideal of correcting the mistakes and shortcomings of the world and problems solved, culture cannot act in haste. True culture recognizes that without knowing correctly what the right action is and what is salutary the work undertaken may result in disaster.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">“Culture is a by-product of social life. A man who lives alone by himself cannot obtain its comprehensive and complete essence. It is a rule that an individual who is treading the path of this perfection has to take others along. If he breaks this rule, his progress will be impeded and his development itself is truncated and he becomes weak.

He is seldom prominent in conversations, and never wearisome. He makes light of favours which he does them, and seems to be receiving when he is conferring. He never speaks of himself except when compelled, never defends himself by a mere retort, he has no ears for slander or gossip, is scrupulous in imprinting motives to those who interfere with him and interprets everything for the best. From a long-sighted prudence, he observes the maxim of the ancient sage, that we should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend.

Similarly, culture is the salubrious commingling of various emotions and feelings – a discipline – of a variety of music and other fine arts, disciplines and branches of learning. There is sense in it, wisdom in it, generosity in it, courage in it, hardness and laxity. Let us remember this sentence of Bhavabhuti –</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">(How can one fathom the heart of an exceptional person?

The qualities that are required to make life meaningful are many, and not of one kind only. For a casual look they may look like mutually contradictory.

But in great men they stay side by side. When he feels that anger is just, forgiveness recedes silently. When forgiveness is just, anger bows out. These various qualities get fulfilled only by the following of propriety. A good quality when it breaks its bounds, no matter how valuable by itself, at the time of the carrying out of action brings about only misfortune. This sort of propriety born out of discrimination and the manifestation of good which follows a sense of propriety is the characteristic of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">We said that culture means the achievement of propriety in the activity of living.

That is the entity which is Eternal, which remains the same at all times and in all states, which is unsublatable, unchanging, the same, ever-lasting, and always existing. That is why, in all our worldly activities and worldly glories what is close to the Eternal Entity and to what extent, to that extent, that particular thing is capable of doing good to us.

Of all things, that which he knows first and foremost without any doubt is his own inner soul known to him as “I”, “I”, and the support for all this knowledge is this same consciousness, his soul. Life exists on account of it. The soul itself is Life. From this Soul is the world. Thus the individual soul is the source for the existence of man. That is the beginning of his life; that is the means of all his activity. That is the only one which remains constant and unchanging at all times and in all states of his experience.

That which he considers valuable or desirable is “Artha”. In English it is called “Value”. Whatever the endeavour or employment of man, it comes under the preview of one of the four object, types of uses, namely Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. (1) The works that are undertaken to achieve progress in this world or to attain a good life hereafter and the means thereof is “Dharma”. All the family and social duties are “Dharma”. (2) The acquisition of the means of obtaining it, be it money or produce etc. is “Artha”. (3) The various kinds of longings and desires are “Karma”. (4) Transcending all desired and being pure, wanting liberation and realizing the ultimate with no other thought is “Moksha”. These four endeavours in life – when they are in the control of the memory of the inner Being – nothing is eschewed; all things become acceptable. But they must be in a state of equilibrium. In the Mahabharata it is said:</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">He who sees to it that there is no mutual conflict between Dharma and Artha, between Dharma and Kama, between Kama and Artha and enjoys all these aspects, Dharma, Artha and Kama attains the greatest happiness.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">(Every day, first Dharma, second Artha (money) and finally bhoga are to be achieved.

It is implied. Here Moksha is an occurrence beyond the world. Moksha is an accomplished fact for him who has achieved the three worldly ideals. When all the mud, dust and debris covering the treasure that has been buried in a hole in the ground is cleared the precious jewels shine forth on their own. There is no special effort required to make them shine. Thus through the three – fold ideal with its contact with the world is washed clean away in life. Then the self - effulgent inner Being reveals itself by itself.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">The Self is that which remains like an emperor imbedded in all objects that appear to man both directly and indirectly. The highest achievement and culmination for man is the full revelation of that, this journey of life in order to get that vision is what makes his life purposeful. The two sides or borders of the road that he takes are “Pravritti Dharma” and “Nivritti Dharma”. Pravritti Dharma consists of training in areas like the family, religion, employment and in centres of the country and geographical area of his living. Nivritti Dharma consists of external and internal cleanliness, charity, control of senses, worship, meditation, sacrifice, disinterestedness, etc.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Many manifestations of the Nivritti Dharma may not be understood by people who skim only the surface. They say “What is the use of fasting?” They ask “Why shout Bhajans? Is God deaf ?” They have not known the turmoils of life. They do not know how to bring courage and strength to life. The secrets of spiritual cultivation, as far as several people of today are concerned – many educated among them – have become like a secret that is whispered for a deaf man. What is uttered is one thing – what is heard is quite another. Just as the senses of vision, senses of hearing, the senses of smell are different, similarly the inner sense organ which can cognize the metaphysical is different. That is the inner vision. That is the inner instruction.

An object is valued according to the proportion of “Sat” (Truth content) in it. Thus the main measure in the calculation of culture is the remembrance of the ultimate Essence – the absolute Self, God, the Lord of the universe.</P><P style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">That human culture which is of this kind deserves the name “Daivi Sampath”. The Bhagavadgita describes its characteristics this way:</P><P style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">“Sattvasamshuddhi” means being without taint in one’s mature, “Shaucha” means purity, “Shuchi” means transparently clean. The Shine which results from cleanliness is given great importance by the Veda; thus:</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We must keep not only our bodies clean but our minds also.</P><P style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As Purandhara Dasa has said “You must clean your minds”.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Because for the unwashed mind, the nuances of the atmospheric differences do not immediately become clear. Just as for a clean hand, the fine and rough things become clear on touch, for the purified mind the surrounding fineness and sophistication becomes clear at one. It is this sensitiveness that we should attain and maintain morally. Just as the string of a Veena vibrates for the wind, pure heart vibrates in response to the surrounding atmosphere. The level and extent of that sensitiveness determines the extent and sensitiveness of the individual moral fibre.

We fix the value for all objects and relationships from the point of view of inner vision. After cogitating thus, arranging and organizing our priorities without doing damage to the higher goal from the lesser, by reconciling and unifying the four-fold ideal – living this way is Dharma. That is the inner core of the Veda and Vedanta system. The self-stuff is indestructible – eternal. It has to enjoy and suffer as results of its own previous actions. This individual selfhood and its history of past actions is beginningless. Similarly is this world beginningless. The ups and down of the individual self are according to the meritorious and mean actions. It earns its existence in other worlds. The individual self gets its relationship with the world according to its own earlier credits and debits. Though such is the binding in the individual body’s breath, new air is mixing with the old air every minute, to the extent of man trying to free himself from old bondage, new breath, new independent respiration will always be arising. He can attain the grace of God through devotion, helping others, meditation and performance of tapas. The individual self by curtailing desire and avarice by practicing disinterestedness and egolessness, attaining self-control and the discriminating knowledge of the difference between the Self and the non-self, through the practice of the Right conduct, that jiva or individual self can rise above the shackles of the cage.

That is “Moksha” or Liberation from worldly bondage. That is Hindu culture which is based on this trend of thought being followed for thousands of years by our people.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Though the word culture is new to us, its meaning is not new. That beauty of social behaviour which has been known to us since old times by the words mildness, gentlemanliness, kindness, smoothness, submissiveness, respect, generosity, etc.</P><P style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">– these are the stuff of culture. Saltness, sourness, pungency and jaggery, where they are by themselves separately, they look mutually contradictory. When they are mixed in a certain proportion in saaru (Rasam) in an agreeable manner, that potion assures distinctively different taste different from each ingredient and extremely taste palatable. Sandalwood, civet (the sweet aroma emanating from a certain type of eat), a type of camphor, saffron, though they are not opposed to each other smell differently. But when they are mixed in a certain proportion, a special aroma seemingly a fifth one arises. Similarly education, politeness, cleverness, courage, compassion, humour, bravery, adventure, dignity, these qualities when they are combined, as a result, a tenth, a beauty of conduct makes its appearance. Where that is present, there will be no room for fear and no opportunity for selfishness. It engenders mutual trust and confidence among people. But it doesn’t obliterate respect. All in all, it creates an atmosphere of friendship and peace. Such is the benefit of culture. Then as a result of maturity, the self is a latent glow emanating always. It is a symphony of feeling.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Let us take an example. All our Sruthis and Smritis say that truth is the ultimate Dharma don’t they? Truth means actuality. Speaking and acting according to what has appeared to us exactly as it has is truth. If this is said the essence of truth seems very simple. It is neither so simple nor easy.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

That which is pleasant but untruthful must not be told either”.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let us compare this advice with another and discuss it.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">“It is said that what is retained unsaid is superior to what is actually said. When it is necessary to speak out, only truth must be said”.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Silence is better than speech. This is the first principle. If something has to be spoken only truth must be said. This is the second principle. That a pleasant thing must be spoken is the third. That what is spoken must be according to and in keeping with Dharma is the fourth aphorism.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">What does it all amount to? (1) As far as possible, silence should be maintained; speech must be minimized. When Dharma doesn’t demand talk, speech must be avoided. (2) When speech becomes necessary it must be spoken according to the approval by truth, it must give up a harsh demeanor and wear the gasp of pleasant exterior and must act to subserve the interest of Dharma and bring benefit to all parties.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There is a method in truth speaking. In many human situations, truth may seem to trust. There is the famous proverb “One who speaks the harsh truth antagonizes the world”. Still, it is the uniqueness of culture to get rid of the harshness and reveal the truth in its mild form. The method and manner of speaking the truth has to be determined by a sense of discrimination and the understanding of the context. Thus speaking the truth is not a mechanical act, it is a well thought about act.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is the opinion of Sage Manu.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Hindu Culture / 25</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">What is true and what is pleasant are not the same thing. Often, not only are they different, but are mutually opposed to each other. In such circumstances removing the unpleasantness while speaking the truth and removing the untruth while speaking what is pleasant is approved by Dharma. After saying this, in providing a bodily sheath to truth in words, a critical appraisal strategy become necessary.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Pure truth is like ginger.

The situation there pertains to the episode of Bharata being informed of his father’s death. After Sri Rama leaves for the forest, when his father Dasaratha passes away, Bharata was at Rajagriha, his maternal uncle’s capital. The Guru, Sage Vasistha sends a messenger to bring him. As soon as he sees the messenger Bharata enquires after the health of his father. The messenger without telling him that Dasaratha is dead, only informs him that he sank to the ground overcome by a heart attack. They start from there and come to Ayodhya. Even then the messenger did not give out the whole truth. His mind hesitates to speak out directly the harsh truth. He thinks:</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Precisely at that time a messenger comes and delivers the message sent by the Preceptor that it was still the duration of the star Krittika and that after a little while when the star Rohini would be reigning, Bharata could then enter the city. Accordingly, with the intention of relaxing in the garden for some time, while searching for a suitable place to do so, he beholds a temple. Bharata enters the temple and sees the row of statues adorned by sandle paste and flowers. When he is thinking of prostrating to them, the Priest enters and says that it is not proper for him to do so.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Bharata : “These must be Kshatriyas.

Who is this other one?”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Priest : “He is Dilipa, one who lighted up the world with his Righteousness.”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Bharata : “My salutations to him, who was immersed in Dharma. Who is this?”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Priest : “Raghu Maharaja – a beneficiary of the blessings of thousands of Brahmins.”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Bharata : “How powerful is Death. It transgressed even the blessings of Brahmin. My pranams to Raghu.</P><P style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Who is this other?”</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Priest : “Kind Aja who was without blemish through the performance of many sacrifices. When his beloved died, he gave up his kingship.”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -56pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Bharata : “My obeisances to him who had the praiseworthy contrition.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">When Bharata was saying this, his gaze travels to the fourth statue – that of Dasaratha. Then, since he hadn’t heard the names of the earlier three with care, he asks the priest to repeat their names. He repeats once again. “This is Dilipa, this is Raghu, this is Aja”. Bharata salutes them separately, severally and asks for the names again. The priest does so. When for the last time the name of Aja is mentioned Bharata tries to remember his relationship with his father by asking “Is he not the father of Maharaja Dasaratha?” He asks the priest “Are the statues of living people kept here?” The priest answers “No, only the statues of the dead are kept here”. And explains –</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Bharata swoons on hearing this. Then he recovers. The story proceeds.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.    Gundappa</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">When Bharata remembers the stories about his ancestors through their statues, the latent devotion towards them hiding in the depths of his memory becomes patent. He pays his homage to each one of them standing in front of the likeness of each ancestor in a chronological order. Thus step by step, by the time he comes to Dasaratha, his mind would have reached a certain philosophical disinterestedness. By contemplating on great people his soul would have reached having beholden a hair-raising ennobling sight. The transient, small-minded emotions would have evaporated and only a long-lasting picture of greatness would be visible before him. Another memory of nobility would have mingled with it. For Raghu who was pure by his very birth, for Dilipa who was universally admired, for legendary Aja, for none of these did Death make a concession. The glory of this world does end one day, no matter how great the man. The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Bharata’s mind would be filled with this philosophy of time. Thus the news of Dasaratha’s death reaches his mind when it has been reminded of the memory of his ancestors, the powerful influence of time and the gravity of the human condition. It was the “culture” of sage Vasistha that he had arranged the timing of the entrance to the city preparing it for receiving the sad news. Not that Bharata’s sorrow was alloyed by this preparation: but its impact must have been softened by this. Supposing without either through the device of the statues or by some other means, Bharata had been bluntly told “Bharata, your father is dead”. What might be the damage for his mind! If we can guess by our common knowledge the mental state of Bharata by a sudden rough announcement of the devastating news without Guru Vasistha’s timely plan, we can surely say that the device considerably arranged the bluntness of the blow.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture is the mode and the method which takes away the string and cruelty from a tragic situation, the pangs of the news</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Finesse in the Depiction of Truth / 29</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">of death and the sharpness of the words and ways of rough human behaviour.

This is from Shakespeare. In the play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth would have lost her mind. Macbeth summons the doctor and asks him to treat her. She is the king’s dear one – a partner in his actions. So it is that her state of mind grieves him. We must observe in what words he informs the doctor this news which has plunged his own mind in a frightening state. Does he say that his wife has gone mad? No. “Madness”. “Distemper”, “Mind’s disease” are harsh words. For the speaker of these words, his own mind suffers while speaking. Macbeth who was loving to speak such words about his beloved is not approved by his mind. So he expresses his mental stress in smooth and soft words.</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Can’st then not minister to a mind diseas’d; Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow; Raze out the written troubles of brain; And with same sweet oblivious antidote,</P><P style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Cleanse the stuff ’d bosom of that perilous stuff, Which weighs upon the heart?</P><P class="s5" style="padding-left: 236pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Macbeth V, iv, 40-45.</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Tr uth has not been hidden here. Only its simple unpleasantness has been somewhat veiled.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

We can say it is “dexterity in speech”. The special characteristic of this kind of communication skill consists of using a method of not displeasing others, but without sacrificing the interests of truth or acting with previously planned self-control. Untruth and injustice need not be present in the smooth concourse. But if crudity and roughness are contained in the truth, “tact” removes only the lack of sophistication. John Morley has said that tact is something that is the ultimate benefit that is bestowed on us by the study of literature. The fruit of the contemplation of good literature and philosophy is that it gives this smooth behaviour; and the resultant controlled use of words, the ability to bifurcate roughness from speech and smoothen it.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Another example.

Yes, there is. For the people who have a vast experience in different fields, for those who have observed with a keen and critical eye, truth is not only irrelevant but can sometimes be inimical.

Arjuna will have come to the battle field after swearing to Dharmaraya that he would finish off Karna. Believing it, Dharmaraya, out of curiosity would be leading the array in another part of the field. A fierce war takes place that day. In one area, the flood of arrows raining fiercely will be attacking Yudhishtira released by Karna, inspired by Shalya. He recedes to his camp unable to bear the pain of wounds. In another part of the field pressuring the enemy, Arjuna, not finding Yudhishtira anywhere, on hearing the news and perturbed, comes to the camp to see his elder brother. Yudhishtira’s mind is full of anxiety and expectation to hear the news of Karna’s death. In that charged situation “he will be under the impression that Arjuna has brought the desired news. But Arjuna tells him how he was belabored by Aswatthama and while escaping came to hear the tragic news about his brother and he</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">32    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

Yudhishtira mistakes this as an un- providing and gets augmented in his anger which was already burning in him. In that fury and excitement he condemns him in all sorts of ways and curses him. “Throw away your Gandiva (Arjuna’s powerful bow). Let there be contempt for your called valour. May your flag and your chariot be ruined.” Arjuna’s reply is equally full of lightning and thunder. Between the two sits Krishna as a silent witness. Then Arjuna hissing like a black cobra turns to Krishna and says “Govinda, you know my oath. I will cut off the head of anyone who asks me to throw away my Gandiva”. Saying so, he pulls his sword from his sheath. Then all his attention is concentrated on the truth of oath he had taken. Parthasarathy (Krishna) who was silent till then, speaks about the secret of Dharma. He addresses Arjuna – “My dear man, what do you know about the true nature of truth? Have your served old men? Have you understood the nuances of Dharma? Have you known about the circumstances when truth can become falsehood and falsehood can become truth?”</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">(It is right that truth has to be spoken.

The action in its result may be the cause of adharma or wrong doing. Sri Krishna himself tells Arjuna a story.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">“In a forest, it seems there was a sage by name Kaushika performing penance. He was a teller of truth. On a certain day, some travellers went running. After a little while some thieves came to him and asked “Did some people go this way? Speak the truth”. Since Kaushika was a teller of truth, he replied “Yes. Some people went that way in the director of the yonder bushes and the grove”. Those robbers were satisfied by his words. They went in the direction pointed out by Kaushika, caught hold of the innocent pilgrims and carried out their wishes. What was the result of the truth spoken by Kaushika? Arjuna, the truth of the oath taken by you about Gandiva is of the same sort!”</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">What Krishna said was a subtle nuance of Dharma.

In a huge heap of corn flour, a grain of life-supporting element, the size of a mustard seed will be hiding. Similarly in a cart-load of do’s and don’ts, the subtlety of right conduct of the size of a speck will be present somewhere, enveloping the whole thing. This atom of righteousness is the very life of the ultimate well-being. The very essence of Dharmartha that makes the existence of dharma dwells in this ray of this atom. That is dharma which is contained in the character and conduct permeating that beneficial ray. The external behaviour is only the body of Dharma, the body is essential; but mere external body is not enough. There must be the inner Essence. The knowledge of that inner “elon vital” is the loadstone or magnet that is gained by culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;">The Synthesis of Various Virtues</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">W<span class="p">hen in the case of the practice of truth which is the very essence of Dharma, so many qualifications and restrictions are required, many words are not necessary to express how careful we must be in the case of other good qualities. Whatever the virtue which we consider supreme, if it is not subject to a certain delicate rules and regulations, it cannot bring about the best results. Moderation is the method of the fulfillment of good. It is only one half of moral science that those opposed to good qualities are bad qualities; the remaining half consists of the possibilities of human situations where good qualities are opposed to other good qualities. For example, let us look at the two lists of good.</span></h2><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">(1)                                             (2)</h4><P class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nobility Simplicity</P><P class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maturity Humility</P><P class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Courage Circumspection</P><P class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: left;">Confidence in one’s belief Curiosity about the opposition A brave resolve Preparation for friendliness</P><P class="s6" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Living alone Synthesis of everyone’s welfare</P><P class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Independence Respect for others Commitment to one’s own Forgiveness of other’s defeats conviction</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In the above list the qualities of both categories seem complementary But for a critical eye the two aspects of horizontal words in each line seem to be contradictory.

Similarly it is not common to see dedication to one’s one creed and the tolerance of another belief in the same individual. One does not ordinarily find an independent mind and heeding the other’s point of view together Thus a commendable quality existing separately by itself, if it has to integrate with an equally good quality which is different, assumes a defiant attitude. The quality of devotion and right conduct towards the mother is the same as that concerned with wife. But when the mother and wife are at loggerheads the unified devotion to mother and the love of the wife which should be unison go in separate ways and break away. In such circumstances acting according to propriety and integrating them, this tact is that of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">It is possible that everyone agrees that love of one’s own country and one’s own people are commendable qualities. Thinking of the welfare of entire world and love all humanity are good qualities, in the same way. But what is near is making a lot of noise, remembering what is dear and just in a distant thing is possible only for a cultured mind.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">For human life to become fully happy, the development of one or two qualities is not enough. Hundreds of good qualities must mingle together in mutual friendliness.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Similarly, the interests and goals of our lives are in hundreds. Our aims should be projecting themselves in myriad directions. Our loves will be tied up in different places. We won’t be able to discard any one of them. That is the reason why we cannot allow disproportionate growth to any one of them. One of them becomes the cause for limiting another. The responsibility of culture is creating the synthesis of disparate through the discriminatory sense of its limits – the synthesis of commingling in various loves.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture makes all areas of life into one unit and looks at the whole thing as impartite.

It is like a bouquet of many kinds of flowers; it is like a perfume compounded of ingredients like civet, saffron and such other sweet-smelling ingredients; its interest is because of the manifold components. The beauty exists not because of the similarity in the quality or appearance of objects but in friendship and co-operation of the dissimilarities in other qualities and looks. No single quality or appearance of objects but in friendship and co-operation of the dissimilarities in other qualities and looks. No single quality or appearance when it is by itself is a cause of beauty. The facts are necessary when it is by itself is a cause of beauty. The facts are necessary to make for geniusness of beauty or shapely appearance complete. (1) There should be many forms and qualities, and each shape and characteristic must by itself stand by itself in unison.

In the beginning these divisions happened because of natural causes. The geographical and atmospheric factors would have shaped the bodies and minds of people. Afterwords their religions affiliations give a turn to their mental attitudes. Their economic situation and employment circumstances shape their character and behaviour. Similarly the history of their country determines their virtues and vices. Thus one account of innate comes various practices, behavioural patterns will have taken root in different societies. The differences in birth, race, category and caste have happened because of these differences in practices and traditions. These groups are not artificially generated by an individual or a group. Nobody has broken something which was a whole. By birth itself, the sibling had ten branches. And neither is it a matter for a lacuna.

When the “saaru” (hot porridge) is tasty, the salt and the sour don’t have to become proper; pepper also is incapable of becoming sour and salty; there is neither the necessity for all the three to become jaggery. Each substance must retain its own taste, but it must mix properly. This proper mixture is the taste of “saaru”.

Why can’t the entire Europe become a single society? It can’t happen; the reason is that the root-cause for the diverse societies, groups and parties are certain natural causes and innate propensities. It is not possible to change those today. When the world (globe) becomes flat like a mat instead of being round, when the sun starts shedding his heat and light with the same intensity simultaneously on India and Siberia, when the wind and the clouds move with the same speed, cold moisture and speed every minute of the day and night, then and only is there a possibility of the human differences dissolving into a single shape and all differences being exterminated.

What remains unmanifest is the general. What is manifest is special. Thus in the great expressed world one part gets transformed again and again. The rest remains the same, unchanged. Thus what is left over is the general. What is subject to transformation is special. Thus the differentiated allotropic forms will be going on non-stop as a tradition. That is the world – that which is ever</P><ul id="l4"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">expanding, that which is spreading out in new directions. In this tradition of transformation the substances of the world, according to the general characteristics there are groups and divisions; classes are formed. The quintessential sub-divisions and individual familiarities are special. They go under the names of particularities, individuality, singular characteristic, inscape, oddity or quidtars. Those things which are dependent on separate distinctions have divisions like “desha-dharma”, duties performing to desha or place, “kula dharma” duties pertaining to kula or family group and “Guna dharma” the duties belonging to inner nature. There are special duties of various kinds.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Those common duties which unite all these into a single code of conduct are called “Samanya Dharma” or general duties, duties common to all worldly affairs.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our pathfinders have considered Dharma as of two kinds</P></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">the general and the special.

All human beings possess eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands and legs. So to that extent the qualities of all men are general; following that principle, man belongs to one group in creation. But the face of one man doesn’t resemble another’s; the nose of one man is not exactly like that of another. One man’s voice is not like that of another. If one observes carefully the intellectual and mental make up, no two individuals are of the same level and swiftness. Just as in the external appearance, internally each man is a separate creation. The characteristics of five children born to the same parents are different. Thus group is one; individuals many.</P><P style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[-Shankra Bhashya – Brihadaranyakopanishat 2-4-9]</P><P style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In the general resemblance all men are one and the same.

That is his uniqueness.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Similarly a group of people is different from another group of people in what ways and to what extent, to that extent it is a different group, or caste, or race or tribe.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The natural differences in character and profession which are not artificial are the reason for the differences in tribe, class and group.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thus in the formation of the world, because of the existence of differences between general and special characteristics, between the universal and the particular bring about mutual attraction and curiosity in life. The general characteristics are their strength becoming a two-fold inspiration for life.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Because of the existence of the excess of defects and virtues mutually, the necessity for mutual dependence arises. Therefore, it is that in groups, organizations and societies, if an individual possesses all the qualities and riches needed, then he does not need anybody else. He does not need a society or a state. For a life which does not come under the influence of society or kingdom, the opportunity to flower forth and attaining proper cultural level will be lost. Thus the nature-born difference between tribes and groups and classes become promotional aspects for the organization of society and the enrichment of life.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thus the differences and variations can also become beneficial to us. Only when they break the barriers do they become harmful. To recognize its limits is the hallmark of culture. The sound knowledge of propriety is culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">From the same cow emerge both milk and dung. The “general” is the stomach. Milk and dung are “special”. Milk is</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 215pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The General and the Special / 49</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">general, cream, sweetened milk, khova, curds, butter, cheese, ghee and buttermilk – these are special. Thus though seven or eight items are brought out from the same milk, each one’s taste is different from that of another. Each unit performs a different function. The various differences that are achieved because of their variations of qualities and functions cannot be achieved by the single, unilateral, original milk. What milk can do, the dung cannot, what benefit comes from dung, cannot be achieved by the single, unilateral, original milk. What milk can do, the dung cannot, what benefit comes from dung, cannot come from milk either. In our world each quality has its own function to perform The goal of life of a particular group is according to that person’s wealth of qualities. This is the teaching of “Swadharma” in the Gita:</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[Death is one’s own duty is better; the duty of another is fraught with fear. Better is one’s own duty, though defective, than another’s duty well performed.]</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">It is true that sanyas (the ascetic’s life) is the best among all (ashramas) duties of life. But having been born in a warrior class atmosphere and having attained fame in the art of warfare, when he is facing an army in the battlefield using fighting weapons is a greater duty than sanyas.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A man’s inner strength and external circumstances together determine his duty. The same is true for each caste, each group and each folk. Each category must improve its own special aptitude, extra strength and innate wealth for the good of the society alone and bring it to fruition in carrying on with life. That is Dharma or duty, what is required for life is not a single quality excellence; not even conflict of merits. What is not a single quality excellence; not even conflict of merits. What is required is a proper synthesis of beneficial qualities. Not pollution of groups; but meaningful mutual friendship. When the jasmine</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">50    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

That is the moral thread joining together various origins, castes and classes and various generations in a unified order. A great culture is the end product and result of those various backgrounds interacting creatively. What is an essential ingredient for its beneficial existence is a discriminating propriety – an informed sense of priorities.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">A cultured man regards individual merit as a sacred thing. He does not try to shape others in his own mould and make them like himself. The belief of the cultured man is “There is a difference between one individual and another; let each individual jiva or soul develop according to its own innate propriety and internal order, its own dharma or duty and what is natural for it. One does not have to become like another. Repetition may not be the design of nature. In order to keep on doing the same thing over and over again, Mother Nature is not lacking in resourcefulness and skill. Variety itself is the ever present characteristic of creation. Each person’s philosophy of life is his own”. Therefore he is sympathetic to the life-style of others, quite different from his own. He can never imagine that he alone is right and that he is the model for everybody.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">He develops the same kind of tolerant understanding towards other societies and other cultures. Though there are several types of culture like regional culture, national culture, linguistic culture, religious and class culture, caste and traditional culture – though there are all these composite cultures, he searches for the common factors among all these which are complementary to each other and integrated them appropriately into his own mainstream culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Freedom for Culture</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">C<span class="p">ulture is something that takes place as a result of contact with the world; it is a requisite for worldly life; still its primary entity is the individual.</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture can be compared to a large wood or garden. In a garden there will be dozens of varieties of trees, plants, creepers and hundreds of bushes. In this vast society of vegetation the wind of one blows on the other; the shade of one falls on the other; the roots of one touch those of the other; thus the development of one touches and transforms the other considerably. Inspite of all these neighbourly contacts the life of each plant will be its own with its difference. Grass does not become jasmine, the neem does not become mango; the tamarind does not become jackfruit. The height or the shortness of a plant, the shape and width of its branches, the thickness or the thinness of it – are determined by its surroundings and situations. But the smell of its flowers, the taste of its fruits do not change into anything unrecognizable by its neighbourhood. That smell, that taste is the essence of that individual. The collective good qualities constitute the beauty of that garden. The same thing applies to human culture. It is the extent to which the individual culture improves to that extent does the development of the total society of all people happens.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The same manner in which a plant gives its own flowers and fruits, it cannot forego its own natural inner need in what it takes. The tree selects and absorbs the things it needs from the earth, the water, the wind and the sun; it lets out what it doesn’t need; all that is needed by the sugarcane is not needed by the</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">52    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

Thus the need of each individual entity has its own preference, chosen by its own inner propensity.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A good gardener knows these individual requirements. He will have known about the price and value of each tree and plant in the beginning itself. Then after considering the differences, he distributes his interests. If a plant that is worth ten points is likely to get affected by one who is worth only five, then he transfers the less profitable one to some other place. Thus knowing the differences between the lesser and the greater, he increases the opportunities for the more profitable ones. He makes room when there is congestion. He pulls out the weeds and clears the ground. He digs a repository of water around the plant. All these are acts of promoting individual merits. A garden is good because of ten good plants; not by a hundred weeds.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For the betterment of the value of a tribe or a society, the individuals must have unlimited opportunity to develop their own native skills. The real freedom is only this wide-ranging opportunities to express himself – his own self. If a plant has to put forth flowers, it must have the freedom to turn its head in the direction of the Sun, its space to spread its branches under the shade and to absorb the life-living essences of the earth. This kind of freedom that is given finds its justification in the flowers and fruits it puts forth. The story of man’s development of culture is also like that.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Advantage for Situation</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">T<span class="p">here are certain necessary conditions and advantages for the development of culture. First of all a man must have peace of mind. That peace comes about from well-organized external circumstances. He must have the confidence that his food, his house, his profession and his income – these things which he has organized for himself must continue as he has planned their continuance must be assured. He must never have a suspicion in his mind that they might, sometime, somehow, may be jeopardized. The guarantee regarding his life is the source of his peace of mind.</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Then he should not have the fear that others might interfere in his endeavours. The works that he has undertaken according to his inspiration and mind will continue – he himself is the dictator of his desires – this assurance he must possess.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thirdly, he must have leisure. If there is an abundance of worry regarding the income for his livelihood or the anxieties of diminishing his enthusiasm, the equanimity of the mind will be spoilt. A mind without rest is like a house without a front yard and a backyard; it is like a paddy field where sowing starts immediately after the crop has been reaped. We must not forget that for development leisure and rest are a necessary preparation.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Fourthly, in his surrounding society there must be encouragement for the search for excellence. No matter how brilliant a man, however great he may be as a scholar; he cannot rise much above his situation and atmosphere; no man can escape the influence of his surroundings. To the extent to which a</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">54    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

When there is no inspiration for progress in the atmosphere, the effort for cultivation of culture is like an effort to find water by digging a well in a desert. Thus, peace, safety, leisure, desire for progress – these are the prerequisites for the development of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In our country, at the time of epics and the great works of art were born, the society possessed those characteristics. Kalidasa, Jayadeva, Jakkana, Sayama, Purandara, Tyagaraja – These did not seem to have faced the tyranny of the kings or conquests and onslaughts by enemies or perversity in their social order in the cultivation of their inner self. The attitude of the ancestors was – let the king mind his own business; let the wars be fought by themselves if they have to be fought; let our safety and the household and societal order be under our careful supervision. Now until about fifty years ago, in our country, except some very small villages, in every town there would be at least one or two scholars and artists. The mad slogan – mongering of the positions, crying house for revolution, the laws regarding the distribution of property rights, the amendments of laws and their vicissitudes, the noisy demonstrations due to caste envy – these things hadn’t come in the way and hindered the literary giants and musicians. They would be satisfied being content with the produce obtained from their lands, with the income obtained by following their own family trade and profession and devoting the rest of their time in the study of literature, listening to the praise of the Lord in the Puranas and Harikathas etc. The result of this was reflected in their social conduct and behaviour, their politeness and softness of their speech and mild manner. This is the essence of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 26pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Today’s is a world of competition.

Competition, confrontation and adventure everywhere. Even a scholar or a teacher has to advertise in a proper place in a newspaper. The aspirants must fill in applications. He must wait at the doors of selection committee members after finding out their convenient time and blow his own trumpet. Even there, there is no entry without publicity. Unless a person struggles and fights with the next man and topples him either by trickery or strength, nobody can earn a living. This egotistic hand to hand and head to head combat is increasing in our country as our contact with other countries is increasing, where the worlds come together, there is a vanity fare. The denser the participation, the greater is the competition. In this exhibitionism each person has to attract attention to himself. That necessitates his patting himself on his back and blowing his own trumpet loud and clear. If he waits for others to recognize him, it may be too late.

The people should not leave the government alone; the government should not leave anybody alone. What should be eaten; how much; what should be worn; how much, what should be sung; what should be heard; what should be learnt, what should be spoken – all these are prescribed by either the government or by the society in our new dispensation.

The likes and dislikes of society are not a result of culture, the taste and desires are only the imitations of other people; whatever makes our tongues water, it is good for us. Whatever glitters is gold; whatever is smooth and polished is a precious stone. Perpetual motion without looking before and after is our “Karmayoga”. Sensory perceptions is our main proof. Feeding the senses and pampering them is our supreme happiness. Such things are today our notion of progress. When this is the ideal of our national leaders, where is the room for individual freedom? Where is the value for culture?</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For true culture the progress of the inner soul is of greater importance than that of physical and empirical progress.

Its way is not the confusion of the higher and the lower. But the discrimination is between the two. Culture does not accept blindly the new-tangled notions of equality and non- difference without examining them. Only so far as the rules and regulations of society are supportive of an co-operative to the individual’s character-building and its purification, they are beneficial. To the extent where individual life does not endanger the good of the society, there the individual’s own freedom should not be tampered within the name of society or nation. The loss affecting the individuality of the individual is a loss pertaining to the nation. This is the lesson of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">We have no opportunity to know the extent of the inner workings of the ways of culture that have been understood by our national leaders who are crying hoarse about culture. They are showing their love of various religions and various persuasions. At one time they say they want private initiative. At another time they say they want nationalization. At one time publicity for social equality; at another time encouragement for personal power. At one time a secular government, at another time a religion – oriented government; today a progressive world- view, the next day devotion to old traditional ways; this minute machine and industrial oriented dedication, the next minute support for rural and village handicrafts. Thus our bosses one dancing this way and that. Are these pre-occupations which are mutually destructive – should these be synthesized into culture, or culture itself is paramount?</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The day on which culture becomes important enough for us when all dual perceptions are merged in its light, there may be a complementary understanding, but it doesn’t look as though the stars are favorable for culture at the present juncture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Culture is a great achievement.

It has come into existence as a result of many types of emotional states, various types of situational inspirations and their integration. One can say that its main root are the Vedas. In that mountain range there are many peaks. The verbal totality of the Vedas as we know it today has taken thousands of years to take this shape. Beginning with the worship of nature deities like Indra, Varuna, Agni and Vayu and spreading through sacrifices like Agnisthoma, Vajapeya and Rajasuya and finding fruition and culmination in the philosophical concept of the oneness and non-duality of Jeeva and Brahman, containing within itself the vision of hundreds of sages and saints, developed through various thoughts and arguments in dozens of stages it has come into existence. In addition, injunctions from a variety of Dharma sutras, Grityasutras and Smriti nibandhana – all such do’s and don’ts incorporated into the others, already mentioned. These set forth spiritual, secular, family and societal conduct. Based on these Sruti (Super/Non human scriptures and smrities (sayings of incarnations of God as in Bhagavadgita and the wise works of sages and saints), the Ramayana and Mahabharata have given a definite direction to the life of our people. The Vedangas or branches or off-shoots of the Vedas like the fine arts of music and architecture have been refining the mental attitude of people. Even the social forces separated from Sruti and Smriti including the questions and problems arising from them have been pictures history, myth and legend and literature.

Thus the primary substance for Hindu culture has been the sum total of Veda, the Dharma Sastras, History, Myth and Legend, Tradition and respect for the holy sages and saints. Within this vast complex of basic, original culture have arisen many regional and class cultures. India is a very vast country, isn’t it? From the Himalayas to Rameswaram, from Kolkata to Mumbai, the quality of the land and the air changes every fifty miles. Within the Mysore State there is a considerable difference in the customs of Hassan and Kolar. In addition to the nature-born external differences, there are language differences, caste, religion and creed differences, differences in conduct and habits have also been born. As a result of this, within the fold of Hindu society there are hundreds of regional and class distinctions creating weales within weales and though not in mainstream culture, in certain aspects is manifold. In addition to all this, in the last one thousand years the influence of the Muslim religions and practices, education and culture have mingled. For hundreds of years the Arab and Parsee influence of people of foreign countries – is seen in literature, music and architecture on Hindu life. After that came the Western influence. Here influence of various sciences that came with Christianity and English literature are important. The functions of the scientific disciplines took the shape of – asking questions like “How is that?” “Why is this?” and opening up a questioning attitude, encouraging freedom of thought, conducting research through novel examinations and new thought to discover sources of the power of nature, acquiring new machines and through them increasing social comforts, inspiring social reformation etc. The necessity for our sage-like intuition to mix with the modern achievements in science has arisen. Thus Indian culture has been growing through a thousand influences.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">62    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

It fixes itself in the ground in the space of a couple of yards thus comparatively in a limited area. But its head rears up sending forth branches and sub-branches spreading forth in all directions reaching out towards the sky sucking forth succor from the air from all winds and gives shelter to thousands of all varieties of birds. If the level of the roots it is firmly fixed, at the level of its head is unlimited and free. Culture is also like that. As its origin it is monocentric, belonging to a single society, a single country. But at the level of yielding fruit in its effect, it is many splendoured and formed out of many societies, extremely extensive. It connects the particular and individual with the universal and the general. Its one end is the individual, the other end is the whole world. It spreads from the limited to the unlimited. Thus culture, starting as it does with a single source – a single society and a people – as it keeps on growing, it incorporates into itself the essence of the entire universal experience, becomes a separate wealth. Thus culture is a combination of the individual and universal.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">We have perceived above what the inner essence of Indian culture is – (1) The sublime level of the Self (2) From that vantage point the order and levels of the four goals of life (3) Consequent order in keeping with Dharma – These three are the foundational concepts of Indian culture. The necessity to accommodate these in the various foreign elements is a necessity that has been recognized by everyone in our country now. This Endeavour of integration is by no means easy, because the value system of the westerners and others is fundamentally different from that of Indian standards. The supremacy of the self which we uphold is not generally seen in their conduct of worldly affairs. They give the first priority to creature comforts and the means of obtaining them, not to the realization of the Self as we do in our culture. Even in this we and they are mutual opposites in a</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">64    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

But still worldly contact has become unavoidable. We cannot give up completely the influence of Europe and America; we cannot condemn them as being intrinsically bad. We have to accept that there are many agreeable aspects in them. This being the case, while incorporating those other cultures into ours, we have to determine their merits and defects from our point of view. The enjoyment-oriented freedom of the Western countries, the alround equal opportunities for the common man, the democratic ideal, the ultimate judgment of society and its acceptance – all these aspects must be re-examined by the Indians in the light of their view of self-Realization, and its ultimate value and importance. This is a job which can be accomplished by a committee of wise men taking their own time and it cannot be done by ordinary common men and in an emotional state and through argument.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[Now if you entertain any doubts in matters of duty or conduct, you should watch carefully how the discriminating intellectuals, upright people, people who are dedicated to truth, those who have conquered anger and other excessive emotional states and those Brahmins who have established themselves firmly in Dharma – you have to follow their example].</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">To sum up, every Indian, while adopting foreign institutions and traditions, if he doesn’t blindly imitate them in everything and remember distinctly the principle “There is such a thing as an Indian view: All changes and difference must be such that they do not clash with our Indianness” – if they act according to this principle, then the synthesis of our own and Western modes might be beneficial to us and bring benefits to the world.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Worldly Progress</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A <span class="p">possible misinterpretation has to be avoided here. There is absolutely no contradiction between worldly progress and self cultivation. Among the original ingredients of culture is science; The study of scriptures and the cultivation of art is another part. The knowledge of various natural and social sciences and the attainment of the principle of creation according to scripture is one aspect; another is the awareness of inner reality obtainable by experience of literature and art. The structure that arises on the foundation of these two aspects of truth is culture. There is place in it for inner peace just as much as for the achievement of mental satisfaction and also for providing the means of creature comforts. Culture does not reject worldly wealth; it is all for it; but within certain limits and in a particular order. Culture does not say no to this worldly comforts and scientific achievement; in fact it asserts its necessity. But it says that science must integrate with artistic and philosophical truth, and not shine by itself. Culture does not object new changes in society; it says that it is necessary; but it demands that the new should come a part of the age-old mainstream. Culture doesn’t reject anything good; it says that all kinds of good are essential. But it says that everything must harmoniously blend in a proper manner and be absorbed mutually.</span></h2><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="38" alt="image" src="190_main/Image_007.png"/></span></P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">66    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

Here the word “Neeti” means that which can bring us our intended goal – that which can get us our obtainable objective. Smoothness, politeness, justice – all these are forms of morals. It is a means of bringing two people together. At one end there is the intender, at the other the intended object or individual. The action at one end reaches out to the other end. Thus the personalities of both these individuals according to this method will be moving always from here to there and back from there to here. Therefore each individual action that man performs in society, each quality that he shows will have its effect in two places. One pertains to the doer, the other to the person affected. When a man tells a lie it shunts and twists the soul of the speaker. It deceives another person. Thus our actions and evil actions affects in two ways. One of them is Self-regarding; The other is world-regarding. That behaviour which is beneficial to both is moral. Truthfulness, cleanliness, non-violence, non-</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 67</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">covetousness, generosity, control of senses – these are moral principles mutually beneficial. A person who follows these things is pure and develops his inner strength and at the same time does justice to co-workers without being a cheat or being unjust.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For this kind of dual moral principle, the origin is a respectful attitude. First of all he must have self-respect. A man must maintain a high level in his speech and actions. He must feel within himself a lacuna if he deviates even an inch from this conduct. He must never give room for any situation where he has to feel ashamed about any of his actions even while not being observed by anyone. He must not feel that he is mean even in his own eyes. Thus a man who has confidence in his own integrity of his conscience has self-respect. How can a man without it respect others?</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The second one is the respect he must have in respect of the world. Just as a person has his own individuality, just as he has his own rights and responsibilities – don’t the others too? There is a necessity of giving respect to them also. Just as he should not embarrass his own soul, he must not give room for other’s souls to get embarrassed. To provide strength without hindering the flowering forth of the just desires of others and without hampering their self-respect is the second part of the moral principle.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thus in our worldly affairs acting with the two – fold interest of oneself and others, in a mutually beneficial way is moral behavior.

It is certain that each living being has its own place in the world order. But which is that place? Every man has the difficulty of finding out its limits and limitations. Here a little experience may be given as an example. It happened when I was a small boy. In order to ward off the evil effects of the cholera disease which had invaded our village, some friends had arranged a bhajan (singing of songs in praise of God) on every Saturday. The bhajan would take place by turns in various houses. On the day on which our turn came, big carpets had been spread in the living room, bright kerosene lamps had been lit and in addition to that on all four sides oil lamps in artistic metal holders were kept and the entire house had been cleaned up and beautifully decorated. In the centre of the hall, facing the door were placed the large framed pictures of Gods which were decorated with flower garlands. In the central portion of the hall a low table had been put covered by a nice cloth and on it were arranged silver plates with flowers, sandal incense and coconuts. Agarbathis, pleasant smelling incense sticks were exuding sweet scent. I had also seen packets of sugar and dried coconut pieces being made, along with areca nuts folded in betel leaves – This “prasadam” to be distributed after the chanting was over. It was but natural that in my mind enthusiasm was springing forth after seeing all this. In that celebration I and my two friends were sitting near the table right at the centre wearing good clothes. That was the time when the bhajan group would arrive at our house from the temple. The group were just about to step in. Then my grandfather came into the hall to see if the arrangements were alright. The moment he saw me he rushed to me pulled me up and quickly took me to a corner and sat me down. Then a dialogue turned between him and an elderly friend of his:</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Friend : He is just a child; let him sit there.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 69</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: -72pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Grandfather : Let him stay; but let him stay in a place fit for him.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: -72pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Friend : He is the master of the house. Let him stay where he likes.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: -72pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Grandfather : Yes; he is the master, that is why he must make room for guests and he must stay in the background.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 144%;text-align: left;">Friend : Can he know all this at this young age? Grandfather : No he can’t; but we can. We must teach.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I don’t remember that I got deflated and wanting in any way when my grandfather did this. After the Bhajan was over and guests had departed, when we were having our dinner, my grandfather talked to me affectionately and said, “child, when you go to a gathering you must know what your place is and stay there”. That is intelligent behaviour. You can know the worth of a clerk by where he places his ink-pot. Similarly when a man is visiting, you can see what kind of man he is by observing the place he chooses to sit. My grandfather added things like “When you sit nobody should say – Don’t sit there” etc. (Nobody should think that such bits of advice have had an effect on me). That advice applies to the large world also. On account of the history of our family, our birth, our educational achievement, our looks and behaviour and also our good fortune – these will have determined our place in society. Along with what is due to us, the rights and honours that are due to others will also have been incorporated in the way we are treated. The understanding of the mutual agreements between us and the others, this knowledge must determine what we should not exceed where we should diminish ourselves in our social conduct. The place determines the responsibility. After comprehending one’s own responsibility, the proper behaviour in keeping with it.

In whatever given circumstances on duty is defined by our own inclinations and strength on the one hand and the wellbeing of our surrounding neighbours’ desires and hopes. This is the concept of one’s own dharma – “Swadharma”. The loss between what is external and what is internal is minimized through acting in a manner that maximum benefits are obtained. This manner of conduct is dharma. When an individual looks at dharma from the point of view of special circumstances, that is his “swadharma”. From one’s own position comes his “swadharma”.</P><P style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">It is common knowledge that many of the ills of our world is because of some people in society trying to aspire for positions beyond their merit and some others occupying important positions and not doing anything to acquire the necessary qualifications afterwards. When a man worth a rupee behaves like a man worth two rupees, the experience of society is like the experience of a man who pushes into his mouth a Marcel of food which is too big for his mouth. That is a tradition of uselessness. There is another kind of preposterousness which is the opposite of this. That is also special with us. That is, a two- rupee worth object. Politeness need not descend to the level of self effacement. Our modesty should not go that far as to make others feel embarrassed. When a man goes to a gathering is well known the people will have an idea where he should sit. If, instead of going there, he exhibits modesty by self abnegation, to the extent to which he pretends, the people also exhibit exaggerated respect towards him. The result is that the lookers on will be disgusted. When a man goes to an assembly of people, he must</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 71</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">not draw attention to himself either through his dress code or outlandish behaviour. It is the characteristic of a gentleman to mix with them unobtrusively like sugar in milk or rhythm in music. The main consideration should be not to rock the boat by upsetting the general pattern with his own difference. When a man visits another also, it is the same principle. Just as we expect a certain code of conduct from them, they also expect it from us. That is just. Our apparel and conversation must follow that code. The freedom that does not respect others is actually vanity.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P></li><li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Our Understanding of the Suggested Desires of Others</h4><P style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Just now a word has been said about external circumstances. The important aspect of it is the knowledge of other’s intentions which are left unspoken. We must be thinking constantly about the effect of what we do on others. Only the belief that our intention is good does not make our conduct beneficial. We must guess the attitude of others in relation to our intended actions.</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[Even a cow can understand what we communicate either by our speech or by the expression of the eye. Horses and elephants carry the burdens hoisted to their backs without being told to do so. He is wise who knows what to do by intelligent guesswork and not by a verbal order. The knowledge of merely suggested meaning is the mark of wisdom].</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There is no greatness in doing what the others ask us to in so many words. We may act according to their wishes after they have literally, verbally expressed themselves either by a sense of obligation or because of the fear of displeasing them, or by making them feel obliged to us or any other reason apart from knowing their mind. The satisfaction arising in others as a result of this is not of the first degree. They get a superior sort of satisfaction by our action of knowing their unexpressed mental desires. Those</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">72    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

The aforesaid knowledge of one’s own place must be conjoined with their position. A cultured man is he who asks himself questions like “If I was in their position how discreet would I be? What would I perhaps do? What would be the right thing to do?”</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A cultured man is he who is constantly questioning himself “How would you feel if the others did to you what you want to do to them? If they spoke about you as you have about them. What would happen to you?” Our sacred texts – Sruti, Smriti and Puranas are full of this message.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are the words of Isavasyopanishat</P><P style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">[He who sees all living in himself and himself in all living beings, he is without attachment and fear].</P><P class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">-Bhagavadgita – 6-29</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[Himself in all beings and everyone in himself].</P><P class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">-Bhagavadgita – 6- 32</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[As if he is everywhere he acts with a sense of equality].</P><P class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">-Apastambha Smriti</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[All beings as oneself].</P><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Such statements are found in a hundred places in the Apastambha Smriti.

What makes for lack of interest is the neglect of the consideration for others. If the joints and wheels of this machine called the world have to run smoothly, silently without creating and croaking and rubbing against each other, then the greasy oil must be flowing freely which is the oil of brotherly feeling and mutual understanding. This kind of unification and integration of one with the others is possible with the pre-requisite of the expansion of the feelings of fraternity. With this flowing of the feeling of oneness between self and others the knowledge of the unspoken thoughts of others becomes possible. This is what has been referred to earlier as “Atmaupamya” in the Bhagavadgita (6-32). The means to achieve this are looking straight at Truth, the discriminating worldly wisdom and contemplation of the Ultimate Reality.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The more a person perceives the depth of human nature, the more a person contemplates on the trials and tribulations of man, when he sees the frailties and foibles of man, what he experiences is not anger but compassion. He cannot criticize too severely the little desires and constrictions. Tolerance, generosity, forgiveness, these are the qualities of paramount importance that a cultured man has cultivated. When he encounters a mistake, he imagines himself in that position and acts accordingly.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The words of an old man who passed away recently may be recollected here. That is something which I know as a direct witness. The old man in question had lived a good life. Because of some unavoidable family reasons he had to sell his house.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">74    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

The man who sold it had to use that road quite frequently. If he met the man who owned the house now, he would make polite enquiries whether he had found happiness in it. Once the new owner invited the old man into the house. He begged the old man with genuine devotion, “Please come, in, see the place and give us your blessing”. He did not agree to go inside. He said “Please don’t compel me”. The owner stopped the invitation right there and kept quiet. After the old man walked a bit further his grandson who was with him asked him “Why did you say so?” The answer of the old man was this “Child, if I had entered the house, would not old memories come crowding in? - How nice is the house now, which was once ours! Thoughts like what a pity we could not retain it would arise and may be it would have given rise to envy! Is it a good thing? It is possible some evil would come their way! Why should we give room to such bad things? May God protect them. Why should our misfortune affect them?” This is the attitude of cultured people.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P></li><li style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Self Control</h4><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The way to facilitate the others desires, is through self- control. The selfishness that is hidden within and will be taking hundreds of subtle forms. It will be emanating deceiving our knowledge. No matter how hard we try to hide our desires of ambitions like amassing wealth either in cash or kind, the intense fondness for the object of our desire, the hankering after power, the drive for fame, our actions controlled by them will be quite obvious for others. At least once in a way, when the others object to it, we will realize it to some extent. At least to the extent that man wants to hide them by protesting that he doesn’t have such defects – to the extent of not showing those traits – he will have a sense of shame.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 75</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Even more latent than these vain desires which rear their heads sometimes, there are certain pet attachments. We parade them by giving nice names like justifiable pride, partiality to merit, excellence of mind, etc. If our little child utters a fond word, if it does something smart, we feel that we ourselves have done it and broadcast it to the whole world that it can bring about universal admiration. If they start praising the cleverness of their own children, we have no patience to listen to it. We call it a “bore” – a bane. We are great, our child is not like that of others; we are special people – This illusion will be hiding in the depths of our hearts.</P><P style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Similarly, the illusion that we are not like the others takes the form of casual conversation. In daily life, every man will find an occasion when he has to speak about others. Some people will be creating such circumstances themselves in addition to existing situations. In such cases, the critical comments on others’ merits and defects will be taking place with great enthusiasm. Like a goldsmith weighing an ornament in a balance, we put the other’s characters in a balance. Then if someone asks “Why are you interested so much in others?” We reply that “Such judgment of merits and de-merits are in the interests of the world”. We hesitate to admit that by de-bunking the greatness of others we derive a sort of satisfaction in our lives. We forget to ask ourselves who gave us the authority to sit in judgment over the character of others. Usually the people in public life who come to power behave as if fate has immersed them with the authority of the job “you go and improve the world”. If they don’t have such a self-confidence, their job cannot be carried out with enthusiasm. But the same self-confidence when it transgresses carefulness becomes the course for injustice on account of over- confident showmanship. As a matter of course, every member of society will have a responsibility, at least to some extent of</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">76    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

However, only to the extent to which it is absolutely necessary without overstepping the limit of its duty does a cultured man indulge himself in assessing the merits of others – and reducing the harshness to the maximum extent possible, confining oneself to the limits of one’s duty – that is the caution of the man of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In a democracy – in a set up where the man who is supposed to be the representative of the country has the power of making laws – the culture which takes the form of giving up the ego may not find much encouragement. Nobody gives way to a person who thinks that his knowledge is limited and abilities are modest and stays back can find a place. Only a fellow who is a go-getter and pushes around and elbows others out will find a place in democracy. This politics of the people will blunt all the niceties of human nature and roughens them.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thus selfishness works in various ways in our nature. Secretly, openly, directly, deviously, openly, indirectly – it will be working all the time in all sorts of ways. It cannot be said that it is evil in all circumstance. Just as it has possibilities of injustice it can also work in just ways. So what we have to desire here is not the total destruction of selfishness, not a complete cessation of it but only its orderly control. Selfishness must be tempered. Let there be self-interest; but let it be within limits, let it work, but let it work under control. Let the principle of righteousness determine its ways and means.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P></li><li style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">An Integrated View</h4><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Integration or synthesis means a co-operative endeavour. It is everyone’s experience that in every question, differences of opinion do exist, but when they raise their head, because of them there should be no harm done either to individual friendship or to the unity of society. To see this happening, we must examine</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 77</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">the various views, put together their veracity and arrange them in a mature manner. Synthesis is this kind of orderly adjustment. Bhagavan Vedavyasa has decreed it especially with regard to the beliefs of other faiths. That policy of integration deserves to be applied to politics, economics, commerce, matters of law and to all aspects of human activity. No single faith possesses all virtues and complete truth; We have to examine each argument with patience and sympathy; what is gleaned from it and to whatever extent, we must integrate with similar virtues in other points of view. For human values to rise to the maximum height, such a synthesizing process is the only means. Among the types selfishness, man’s love of his own faith is one. ‘Faith’ means opinion, belief, feeling. One’s own faith does not merely mean what we have inherited from our forefathers and from our surrounding society only and its values; The expression “one’s own faith” indicates all opinions about all subjects. This clinging to one’s own beliefs is the root cause for all disputes and quarrels. Very often when we are talking to friends we say “Didn’t I tell you this that day itself?” or “I have been saying this right from the beginning!” We have such faith in our own intellectual convictions. Many self-styled world-teachers and leaders of men have greater attachment to their brain-children than to their actual physical children born to them. This excessive attachment is the root of all astheistic arguments.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P></li><li style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Lopsided View, not correct</h4></li></ol><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Many years ago in North of our country there was a holy man called “Lavanananda Swamy” (Lavana in Sanskrit means salt). His view was “Salt is the penacia in the world; if you keep eating salt, all diseases will disappear. No other medicine is of any use”. Similarly there are some devotees of Lord Sri Rama. No matter what mistake you have committed. No matter what</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">78    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

This is the argument of the devotees of Lord Rama. Such a poet has said:</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[In the forest, the hunters (the Sanskrit-speaking ones!) were going about saying:-”Let us move about in the forest. (“Charama” means “moving around” and the sound “rama” is contained in that word. Let us rob the things – jewels and clothes – of the travelers “Apaharana” means “steal” but has “rama” in it. Then we will cross the river. “Tarama”s meaning “cross over” has the word “rama”. Then we will have no fear. “Na smaramah” meaning “no fear” has the letters “rama”. Thus when they traversed, because the word “rama” was attached in the words they used, they attained Liberation].</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This is a travesty of devotion of Lord Rama. This stanza may be admired because of the clever use and repetition of the word. But where is the devotion to Sri Rama in these words? Is a sincere and genuine devotion seen here? And, for Liberation mere devotion without self-knowledge enough? Should there not be a synthesis of discrimination and practice of it there?</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The trust in salt of Lavanananda and the trust in the holy name of Sri Rama – such trust are the slogans of many of our political and social reformations. “Ahimsa is the invincible weapon;” “There is no way but Khadi way (the hand-woven cotton fabrics)”; “Better anarchy than slavish compulsions” “Those who don’t want industrialization will have to go a begging in the streets”. Such ear splitting street slogan shouting shatters the very atmosphere of our times. There may be a grain of truth in these. It there no taste in salt? Is there no merit in the chanting of the Lord’s name? But in addition to the presence of limited good, there will also be attached a great deal of lack of any merit.

In our times, the facilities and conveniences for the propaganda of religion and faiths have increased to an unprecedented extent. The printing machines are in abundance; paper is cheap; the telephones, newspapers and platforms are a plenty which instead of increasing awareness are augmenting noisy controversies. The singing of the praises of Rama are a balm to the ear; Rama’s banishment to the forest is intolerable even to imagine. So people go to the easy bhajans of Rama; the vow of Rama is not even recollected. It is natural to understand what is easy. The newspapers and the leaders of men prepare their pills of panacea, put them in attractive bottles with catchy labels pasted on them and sell their ideas. It is easy for people to swallow these pills. It is difficult to examine their composition. People do what is easy.

Truth has a thousand forms. The proper application with taste and finesse of these take ten thousand shapes. Therefore to insist that one question has only one answer is far from truth. To get from one place to another one can’t have a straight road as the crow flies. The straight road may be full of pitfalls and difficult to negotiate. It may look like a shortcut but in fact may be a circuitous one. The path that looks distant for the eye may actually be quite close to the feet to walk across. Thus if anyone asks “which is the nearest route from Mysore to Bangalore, two or three answers will have to be given according to the questions – “for whom?” and “in what vehicle?” Depending on each condition different answers are correct. In all human dealings, a single definite, final answer “this is so” cannot be given at all. Such being the case, wherever there are such differences of opinion each one should adopt a conciliatory tone and say in a compromising way “could be”, “It could be that way too”. Then the aspects of differences between various opinions will decrease and points of agreement will increase. In today’s world the argumentative good manners is missing. All people will be attached to a particular point of view, and will take a strong fanatical position. It is these fanatical following and strong allegiances that are mainly responsible for the turmoils of the present day world. If the world should give up these extremes and become a friendly place, this diplomatic “may be” attitude must be taught and that culture should spread.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Man’s life, like the confluence of rivers like Ganga and Brahmaputra contains the hundreds of powers and speeds getting merged.

That is culture. That is diplomacy in dealing with worldly affairs. That is the light which pleasantly lights up life. There are hundreds of things which we want moment by moment in our lives. The Sruti itself has said “Asmin loke bahavaha kamaha” (Taithiriya 3 Br 13 – 9) which means that there are many desires in the world. Culture is that which informs us which will have to be obtained to what extent to be within limits should be eschewed to avoid excess.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In a kingdom the agriculturists inform what is good for them and request that it should be given to them. The merchants know what is beneficial to them and demand it. The city dwellers look to their comfort. The villagers beg for their conveniences. If you look at them separately, each demand looks just. But there is a greater entity, above and beyond all these, encompassing all these and many more entities. That is the country. Keeping that totality in mind and its good, doing justice to all sections without hindering the progress of the others is the efficiency of the minister. When a garland of many jewels worn by different parties, are sewn together through a thread of synthesis passing through all of them and making the whole thing into a single garland – that is the man who is politically astute. That which we call right taste in the proper proportionate blending of salt, sour etc. in cooking, that which we call melody in music which is an integration of sruti and laya (sound and tempo), that which we call proportionate representation of various parts in a statue, that which we call a diplomatic policy of dissolving differences of various kinds in administration, such a creation of synthesis which is satisfactory, such a self-controlled behaviour, such a universally beneficial, genuine, enlightened originality is what is called culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">82    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

Among the myriad things we want, there is not a single one which is unnecessary; but there should be a fixed order of priorities in their importance. Some come first. Some later. This relative position is the basis for synthesis. Determining the value of various things and arranging them in steps, from the point of view of ultimate value of inner importance is the synthesizing principle. That is the organization of our desires and duties. There is nothing unjustly treated; nothing gets greater importance than what it deserves.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h4 style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cleansing Policy</h4><P style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The cultured individual has the same cleansing attitude regarding the clinks and quirks of the world and adopts the same technique as a good surgeon does regarding a sick patient who is suffering from a disease pertaining to a particular organ. The surgeon may have to resort to the use of knife and scissors in order to set right the diseased growth of flesh in the stomach, or untangle a knot of nerves or cure the sore of the bone. But he first thinks “Can’t it be set right without an operation?” Until his conscience says that it is unavoidable, he cannot touch his instruments. And after he has decided to operate he prepares methods like “chloroform” in order to assuage the pain to the patient and takes every precautionary measure. When it becomes absolutely impossible to avoid pain, he tries to reduce the pain to the maximum extent possible. And then cuts off the minimum portion of the nerve or the bone. He doesn’t remove even an iota more than necessary. He will be all the time concerned lest he should over act. He cures the wound in the earliest possible time after the operation.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A cultured man doesn’t approve the quirks and the perversities in the behaviour of the people around him. But he</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 83</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">doesn’t impatiently interfere either with the course of reforming them. He is always engaged in the endeavour of correcting himself; and correcting his near and dear ones. But in that process of correction there is no crudeness. He doesn’t shout about his own stubborn convictions; his face doesn’t show him with red, inflamed eyes and the grinding teeth. When it becomes absolutely unavoidable for him to register his dissent he shows only the force and power that are just enough and never shouts raising his voice. With his discourse and conduct he makes the disagreemnt unobtrusive.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">A truly cultured man acts as a mother does when she is punishing her child or when a faithful wife corrects her husband. He answers with a friendly attitude. The loud – mouth response of the others doesn’t make him shout about; the contorted faces of others doesn’t take away his pleasantness. If the main characteristic of culture is to be summarized in a nutshell it is “lack of crudeness”. A certain amount of strength becomes necessary in worldly dealings. Some occasions do arise when the voice has to be raised. A man cannot always remain a ball of butter or a lump of jaggery. It doesn’t always make for righteousness. Dharma or right conduct itself demands bravery and uncompromising attitude sometimes. In such circumstances the cultured person doesn’t go haywire and becomes hard, just as hard as is justifiable in order to set right the world. The cane of the schoolmaster is sharp at one end and affectionate at the other end. The hardness of the cultured man is just such. There is no roughness, no perversity, no self forgetfulness in it. In everything his is a smooth way, a delicate step. A strict behaviour without ostentation, a slap that doesn’t hurt.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h4 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Elegant Simplicity</h4><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Above all, a sense of proportion – humour – elegance – simplicity which means an attitude which searches for what</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">84    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

In whatever we see in our daily life the sorrowful content predominates. The cultured individual searches for beauty inquisitively in the midst of this mess. He searches for pleasantness in the midst of bitter circumstances. When misfortune lands him in a desert, instead of being enveloped by depression, he doesn’t stand resourceless but searches for a cool “oasis”. That is his nature. He is one who searches for a footpath in a dark forest, who wide-eyed, looks out for a lantern-light in a village hut in the forest of the night. This is the quality which our ancestors have called the capacity to see good. It seems the swan can separate milk from water in water-mixed milk, takes only milk and rejects the water. It seems Lord Parameshwara, when both the moon and poison came out of the ocean, put the moon on this head and retained the poison in his throat to prevent it from affecting others. This partiality for good and rejecting evil is the mark of good taste. A cultured man retracts his mind’s eye in all circumstances from inauspicious things and directs his gaze on the auspicious which may be hiding behind the other. He tries to instill the hope of light in the hearts of the depressed with darkness. In the midst of people whose faces are taut and tight-lipped he says something humorous to relax their mood. In a lackluster situation he will create an opportunity for laughter. He will turn our attention from the dried up bark and branches of a tree to fresh sprouts and towards green buds. He believes that the fresh will be behind the stale, that green lurks behind a fossil and this is so always, everywhere. He is a man with a heart. In him will be swelling forth the essence of human love, the essence of sympathy and compassion and the essence of friendship. As a result of the efficacy of that elixir all his bark and all his moral principles will be felt as salutary by the people. That refinement and that beauty is what renders human life attractive. That is the inner essence of culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Who is a cultured Man?/ 85</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Even in simple enjoyment there is a question of propriety. He (the cultured person) will also have his share of joy and sorrow like the others. But he doesn’t broadcast the depth and width of those experiences. When he sees the petals of a flower opening up, his mind also might open up and eyes beam. But his hand doesn’t stretch forth to pluck it. When his efforts bring forth victory and triumph his heart may respond and his lips part. But its sound doesn’t break forth beyond the line of these teeth. In his laughter there is no laughtiness; in his pride there is no vanity. Even when he picks up and fondles his child, he looks this way and that. Because he doubts whether it will affect somebody’s mental equilibrium. That kind avoidance of excess</P><P style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">– that kind of self-control – is the hallmark of culture. It is good manners which doesn’t ask for fame, it is a happiness that doesn’t make noise.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The world-machine is a very big one. Its wheels and joints are in hundreds. If these things have to turn smoothly without a creaking and cracking noise and stop altogether, its wheels and joints must be well oiled now and then, quite constantly, infact. That smoothening oil is culture. With his moral devices which are consigned by his sophisticated vision, with his balanced and friendly policies of behaviour – the burden of our life will be lightened at least to the extent of bearability, the tiresomeness of the journey will be forgotten. Culture is the architectural device which makes the road smooth the path for the chariot of Dharma.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="38" alt="image" src="190_main/Image_008.png"/></span></P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">86    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

The mind is not outside the body. Therefore the world of the body is not far away for the man of taste. The commerce of the mind is only through the body.

Among the acts of commission pertaining to the body and the mind, the most direct and famous is eating. Hunger is natural to all living beings. Everyone wants a meal. But there are two kinds. (1) One uncultivated (2) A man of cultured taste. The ordinary man wants his stomach full. For the man of taste not only does he want to fill his stomach but he desires a perfume to envelop his mouth. For the common man quantity is important, for the man of taste quality.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">All young ladies want to wear flowers in their braids.

The cultured waits for scent, flowers and music. The satisfaction of the uninitiated is in the body; that of the man of taste is in the mind.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">What is eaten, seen, heard and enjoyed are important for the body.

It is anterior to book learning. Earlier than modern European civilization took root here, highly cultured people who were not literate were found in abundance. If any person had to be complemented, he would be called a “sabhya” or a well-behaved, upright, soft- spoken person. This fit for assembly – fitness for cultivation in society – was culture. In the villages, the illiterate agriculturists, shepherds and potters were not lacking in culture. They knew very well the difference between the just and the unjust, between the big and the small, the proper and improper conduct and behaviour. The so-called educated people, when there were disputes and differences of opinion among them, would invite these non-literate upright men and respect their decision. Thus it is clean that there is no inevitable connection between book learning and cultured right conduct</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">How did culture spread so widely then?

Three or four aspects are important here.</P><ol id="l10"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: -25pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">Culture is a living entity.

It takes its own time. It won’t do if we want to speed up the process of child’s teething, talking, and walking.

There is no need for any special effort. A characteristic of health is strength. Similarly if the organization of learning and education is proper, culture grows by itself. A separate propaganda for it is unnecessary. Our ancestors had found this out. They knew that indirect influence was more fruitful than direct propaganda. This is the reason why they established the indirect influence in every aspect of life through stories, poetry, music architecture and aesthetic appeal. The varied popular cultural arts and activities like bhajans, narration of puranas, gospels like harikathas, recitation of epics, ballad-singing, various types of stage productions like Bhagavatarata, Yakshagana and drama – these were the artistic means to achieve the end of preservation of culture. Things like temples, towers and pinnacles, processions and religious gatherings performed the same function for attracting people and having a hold on them. It is the art of dissolving the artistic teaching in a tasty connection to drink. Just as in tasty rasam, health – promoting and medicinal charactered ingredients like, pepper, cardamom and other herbs and roots are mixed resulting in improved taste performs the function of digestion – doing good without our conscious knowledge – so too the fine arts, through providing aesthetic pleasure and entertainment purify them. The elevation of the spirit through engendering the memory of the sacred in the vicinity of a holy spirit is the origin of culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Culture not by Books Alone / 89</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Creation of the atmosphere of spiritual elevation was the objective of our ancestors. They suspected that direct teaching and slogan-mongering might not only be fruitless but even counter-productive. Institutions like temples, charity houses, maths or monasteries and places of pilgrimage – all such institutions became the means of uplifting the minds of people from the mundane to a higher level. Ritual worship and listening to sacred myths and legends came in handy to supply courage, patience and belief in their moments of doubt. Incidentally they taught them the discrimination between the higher and the lower and a sense of humility. What else is culture? The culture of our people is the inner cultivation of the result of such virtues for thousands of years without fuss and hurry, without artificiality and without noise and fanfare. Fortitude in misfortune, partiality for justice while surrounded by injustice, contemplation of the spiritual in the midst of the secular – these are the qualities that have been the protective armor for the Hindus for thousands of years. This is not the job of publication and propaganda. It is the endeavour of natural wisdom. Our people have recognized the value of culture themselves and have accepted it. That is why culture has survived.</P><P style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="38" alt="image" src="190_main/Image_009.png"/></span></P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">90    /   sa÷skÅti    <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.    D.V.

In matters of food and recreation the old restrictions are loosening, the moral bindings of people have been shaken. The past generations believed in truth, (“Sathya”) sanctity of promises (“Niyattu”) and spiritual merit (“Punya”). Even if we say it was a superstitious belief, as a result of it one could see in their behaviour a certain strength, a certain confidence and a certain reliability. Today the fear of sin (“Papa”) is vanishing. The belief in other words and after life has withered away. Even the memory of what is called God is becoming rare.

The scientific education brought in by the English shook the roots of our culture to a considerable extent. Let alone the condemnatory slogans indulged by the priests in conversion propaganda. More than that was the influence the sciences brought that came to us through English. This scientific probing was question – oriented. “How is that? Why is this? Where is heaven? What is the proof for the existence of God? What is the evidence for the workings of Karma? Who is the witness for re- incarnation?” Such questions eclipsed the old beliefs. But this eclipse did not spare Europe either. Even there, the old religions upheavals took place. It happened with us also. But of late there are signs of the eclipse ending there. The necessity for re- valuation and re-thinking in the re-examination of certain conclusions reacted. Therefore the danger to religious beliefs from science is decreasing. Now science does not reject religions injunctions. This is a heartening matter to those who have a confidence in the culture of the Indian sub-continent.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Is there a place for Indian culture in the present-day world? If it has to survive and grow, should it incorporate certain equations in its structural aspects? What type of things are they? Just as they are important question, they are equally complex and difficult. If the present writer attempts to answer this briefly it would take some such shape as this: That spiritual outlook, that curtailing force of sensual pleasures, that moral overview which controls excessive hoarding and acquisition instinct because of our scriptural heritage, these characteristics are necessary for the world of today.

But first of all, we must make it clear to ourselves and apply it in our daily life. Are we today in a position to tell others that they should follow our example? Wherever we look in our country today what we see is disorganization, dissatisfaction and lack of proper orientation. Along with this, we have not yet thought fundamentally about the question of how to equate our scriptural tradition with that of the West. Without spoiling the Indianness – without our nation becoming second to anyone in our strength and riches, in a way in which it is highly respected in the eyes of others, other nations, we must equate our culture once again. It is possible only through cogitation and criticisms.

Culture means no aspect of life becoming excessive; everything being within limits and under control. Such a limited state for most people is without excitement and tame. From this point of view there seem to be two kinds of people. Most people want speed, ostentation and passion. Only just a few desire peace and equanimity. Between Dharmaraya and Bhima, only Bhima is appreciated, preferred and clapped by ordinary folk. Those who admire Dharmaraya are few and far between. At the slightest provocation Bhima twirls his moustache. One who shouts shall I knock down a hill? Shall I drink the ocean? Shall I uproot the tree? Shall I swing my mace and fell the sun? A man who cautions, we should not act in haste; let us weigh the pros and cons; Do we in anyway transgress the righteous path? Such a person is considered a coward.

For them culture is a bland food – fit only for people recovering from illness. It is only natural that it should appear so, isn’t it? Those who can appreciate culture are those who have matured with the experience of suffering. Those who have learnt their lesson of observing those who have gone astray through false enthusiasm for wrong things and immature undertakings can know the value of culture.

The American philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) has said – “Culture kills the propensity for excessive importance; it kills his pride in saying My village, my town. When we came out into the street we should leave our loving little children at home and look at the people we meet with a large – hearted discriminatory sense and politeness. No piece of work is worth its while which is done without a feeling of fraternity… The man who has attained fame as a brilliant person would have bought that fame at a great price. His head would be swollen and flying high in an ivory tower. Instead of behaving like a healthy and happy person, he will be jumping about like a madcap. The reason for this inner vanity and egoism is the extension of the external attractions. Their variety is the proper medicine. Acquaintance with the ways of the world, coming into contact with different levels of people, traveling, good medical treatment, philosophical enquiry, art, thinking of religious tenets, study of books, social concern, cultivation of being alone – these are the medicines for the natural pride of man”.</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">As the pride in us decreases, so does discontent; and the burden caused by us to the world also gets lessened. The mental attitude (Yoga) of lightening the weight of life is culture. This is Self-cultivation. The word “Culture in English means this inner training, the sophisticating process of the latent Self ”. All this meaning is contained in the following poem of Emerson.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">The Words of Emerson / 95</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Can rulers or tutors educate The semigod whom we await?

Then, at the beginning itself, they said:</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[Lord, you are a great man – One who knows Dharma and one who has love for it.

Sitadevi entertains a doubt.</P><P style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A kshatriya who is armed, like fire near the firewood becomes very potent and in that state of power may return to violence. Indra thought of disrupting the tapas (intense meditation) being performed by a sage and so he took the shape of a warrior and in that disguise gave the sage a powerful sword requesting him to keep it safe for him until he came back to reclaim it. The sage agreed and received it. Then what happened? The sage got enamored by its shine and sharpness and held it all the time, kept on using it and went to hell. The possession of weapons has that effect on the mind.</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">“Therefore I am afraid because you, Rama and Lakshmana are armed. You may hurt or harm animals without reason. Beware that these weapons may generate cruel thoughts in your minds. Let not the innocents be affected by you.” After Sitadevi cautions this way, she addresses her husband: “Not that you don’t know what I am telling you. I am not preaching and teaching you. I am only reminding you of what you know very well already. Prompted by the love I bear you, not to feel any lacuna in my great confidence in you and the pride I entertain in your regard, I am thus bringing it to your kind notice.”</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Thus spoke Sita Devi.

The king said “Alright.” But the king was a man who knew the nature of Brahman – one who was enlightened. Gargya started mentioning the Sun, the Moon, the other luminous bodies, the powers of the great elements etc. One by one. Ajatashatru went on answering that none of them was right in the same technical terminology. Finally Gargya was defeated and he begged Ajatashatru “You yourself teach me.” But he said –</P><P style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">[This way, when a Brahmin goes to a Kshatriya and says “Let him teach me Brahman” is a contrary method (a topsy turvy approach) I will confess to you what it is by way of reminding you only (not with a felling that I am your Guru).

Srikantaiah made a joke. While discussing the adjustment that should exist between old tradition and new literature he provoked the audience to laugh by saying – The wife of a Brahmin is a “Brahminiti”, the wife of an “agasa” or a washerman is an “agasiti” – (These are female gender formations in the Kannada language). Similarly someone might say that the wife of “Samskrita” is “Samskriti” (“Samskrita” is the Sanskrit language and “Samskriti” means “culture”. The word “Samskriti” had come into vogue in Kannada only recently at that time. After that the use of that word has become increasingly frequent. Even the governments have felt that something called culture has value and they are giving it importance. Actually it is correct that it is a valuable thing. But what is this thing called culture?</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture is the new name for a certain old thing. It is something that smoothens life. That is its meaning. To cultivate the virtues through which we live our lives with taste and finesse, through which the excesses like sourness and pungency are reduced and the interest in the process of life is increased, cultivation of such qualities is culture. It is a kind of education of the inner self.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In this life every individual, every moment of his existence has to have a relationship with the world, hasn’t he?

What is salutary? What is the nature of the good? Shall we say that what we like is best; that is the largest good? The child always wants sweets. Is it good? When we board a train to sit down, if the compartment is full and we feel like throwing a couple of people out, is it good? When we are walking in the street if the flem forms we feel like spitting it out immediately wherever we are. Is it good? Are our likes and dislikes the evidence for deciding what is good? It cannot be; because it is in everybody’s experience that the desires and tastes of people are various. Each man’s mind is his own. Therefore the ever- changing individual and personal experiences of ours cannot be taken as the principal touchstone of what is good. If our standard keeps on changing moment to moment, then it has to be one which can stand firm, unmoving and permanent. The epistemological truth must be contained in the container itself. It must stand by itself – be self-sustaining without the need for any external evidence or proof. If we can obtain a truth that is capable of spacio-temporal transcendence and common to all mankind, we can build our concept of truth on the foundation of its build our concept of truth on the foundation of its beneficial nature and salutariness. Is there such an unchanging, unmoving, eternal entity called truth? This is the fundamental question. In order to find an answer for this, we have to engage ourselves in some metaphysical speculation.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The human being who keeps on repeating “I”, “I” doesn’t have any doubt about the existence of that principle of Being, does he?

It is that self-same force which is making every living being say “I”, “I” and creating a connection between that and the world. All the comforts and happiness that are desired by man are but the vapours and drops of that ocean. The highest good, the greatest and ultimate goal of man is to be integrated into and become a part of that mighty ocean unlimited in its bliss. The intimate proximity of the individual soul and the absolute Self is the greatest auspiciousness. It is the ultimate goal. That code of conduct conducive to that state is good to that extent, that object which proves convenient to attain that is good to that extent, that is Dharma or right. That object or behaviour which is an impediment to this realization is bad to that extent. It is Adharma or wrong. Thus the concept or action of a man as related to the attainment of the proximity to God lies the goodness or evil. Dharma is that which determines worldly priorities from the point of view of the Realization of the absolute Self. An allotropic form of that Dharma is culture. Culture is the Dharma that has taken shape in the form of worldly contact.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Man, when he rises above innate nature is culture. The large hill at Sravanabelagola is nature; the statue of Gomateshwara on top of it is culture. The river Kaveri is nature; the paddy fields on its banks is culture. The cooked rice and sweet porridge is culture. Hair is nature; hair-styles of various kinds is culture. Cotton is nature; the sari and the dhoti are culture. Shouting is nature; singing is culture. Idle bellowing is nature; literature and drama is culture. When a child passes urine in bed, it is nature; when it comes out to do it is culture. If a man stays just as he was born, it is nature; with education and civilization he becomes cultured.

What can we do about it?” We argue as if just as we cannot change the colour of our body or our size, we cannot change our mind and minister to its quirks and contours. That argument cannot be sustained by reason or logic. Just as there are remedies to cure bodily illness, there are also medicines which can set right and cleanse mental and intellectual defects.

Their consequences and transformations are also Nature. The birth and death of various animals is also Nature. Their bodies and organs are also nature. Thus the entire visible world of ours in our experience and each and every object in it and their functions, are all nature.

Is not his intellect just an aspect of that same Nature? What does it mean when it is said that he should use satisfactorily and creatively? If man’s mind is only an infinitesimal atom of the vast mountain of nature, is it possible for the atom to be superior to the enormity? Is it possible to raise the mountains and lift it with the tiny atom? Unless we cogitate on these questions, the true nature of culture cannot be mentally construed.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is true that Man is a child of Nature, but a special sort of child. As Mathew Arnold has said-</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Man hath all which Nature hath, but more, And in that more lie all his hopes of good.</P><P style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Man must begin (know this) when Nature ends;</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Culture and Nature / 107</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Nature and Man can never be fast friends Fool, if thou canst not pass her, rest her slave.</P><P style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The uniqueness of Man is his creative intellect. In every thing being of the world, two things are visible, aren’t they? One is the body. The other is the life. The body is Nature. What is known as “life” is the inner activity, consciousness, not inert. The basic substance of that active entity is the self which transcends Nature. Nature takes on different forms and keeps on putting on various forms. The Self is not subject to change and remains for ever in the same state. This inner self is the essence of “life”.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The knowledge of that inner self is the uniqueness of the special creation – Man. The other animals don’t have the remembrance of the soul-stuff. Nature should have hidden the knowledge of the self in non-human animals. Even in man – Mother Nature – she would have left only a small proportion and room for self-knowledge. She would have covered up his eye – the inner eye – with a veil for twenty three hours, six days a week. A brave man who turns inwards to explore his real Self once a week for the remaining one hour may be one in a thousand!</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There is a blend of three qualities (Gunas) in Nature: (1) Sattva (2) Rajas (3) Tamas. (Works like the Bhagavadgita and Manu Smriti explain their qualities). Though all these three qualities are blended in the nature of every human being, among them each quality takes precedence over others in each individual</P><ul id="l11"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">and sometimes different qualities manifest themselves at different times in the same individual. When the “Sattvik” nature becomes predominant, man’s mind turns in the direction of the inner self. That is the auspicious moment. The same thing is Dharma. Dharma is that which is holding together and bearing everything. That which is the support and foundation for the living and the world – that which is wearing and bearing the self</P></li></ul></li></ul><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">108    /   sa÷skÅti   <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.   D.V.

Thus, that kind of living which follows the remembrance of Parameswara, the Supreme Lord is Dharma. That is Dharma which makes a man turn towards the self instead of moving away from its Realization.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">It is not possible for the occurrence of “Sattva” never to happen ever in the life-span of any man some day, some moment. On account of some event in the world, in every human being there will arise the “sattva” quality in every man. That very moment is his moment of realization. If he wakes up to it then, he will know the path of good. When once he realizes the true nature what is good, it will be easy for him to distinguish between priorities of values. For one who has come to know the steps of values, determining the moral foundations is not difficult.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The means by which we know he differences between what the relative importance of things are, is the intellect. When “Sattva” springs forth what he has to be careful about is in matters of mind. The function of the mind is to determine through its intellectual function what is proper and what is improper. When it happens as a result of the thinking mind, it becomes the light of life’s progress.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The intellect is like a bridge connecting the external world and the inner self. It is a rope bridge. The hands that tug at them are the states of Rajas and Tamas. When “sattva” pulls it, the mind turns in the direction of the self and it acts as a corrective to the involvement with the world. That is culture. When Rajas and Tamas pull at it, the intellect turns towards the world and becomes a slave to the emotion of love, hatred and illusion. That is nature.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The individual free – will consists of making the mind stay put in “sattva” and preventing it from succumbing to Rajas and Tamas.

If all events in life are controlled by nature, if everything is pre-determined and man is not born free, if his own willed actions have no scope, then he cannot be subject to “Punya” (spiritual merit) and “Papa” (sin). Burdening a man who is not “free” with the fruits of actions is not just. Nature herself would have located personal freedom within man himself. That is why he has the responsibility of Papa and Punya. That is why it is inevitable for him to accept the fruits of his action.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">When the intellect performs its function with inner sanction, man’s attitude to the world gets transformed in two ways – (1) Behaving towards others as he would behave towards himself, he is himself the measure for others. (2) The discrimination of what is more wealthy and what is less so.</P><ol id="l12"><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">He becomes capable of recognizing that the same life- force that is within him is what is within all living beings and the others are really oneself.</P></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">He will be constantly correcting himself by observing the high and the low in the world and the desires and intentions of his will be subject to the critical examination of his discriminatory weapon.

He is more ready for self-sacrifice. The fiend of covetousness cannot capture him. Excessive possessiveness and attachment to worldly objects cannot come near him. The possibility of this clashing with others is very rare. He searches for a way of reconciliation in a situation of the quarrel. This way also he becomes dear to the world.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Culture is that propriety resulting in a behaviour moulded by a policy of treating others as oneself and the priorities of wealth determined by discrimination.

The sense of propriety comes to him automatically, quite naturally like breath to the nose. His limbs and mouth, like the mind and the intellect behind them are always under his control. It is this control of the senses which is self- control; it means keeping himself under all control. He is the truly cultured man in whose internal machinery the nuts and bolts are ship-shape and smoothly oiled. His knowledge of proprieties and priorities is the mark of culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For these various qualities of culture to develop and strengthen, a long-time effort and practice are necessary. Can the congenital quirks and dirt be discarded like removing the apparel? It is only by adhering for long and steadily – it is only by “tapas” (concentrated meditation) that it is possible. That achievement of the principle cannot be completed only through conscious intellect. The whole mind should co-operate with it: The mind is more potent than mere intellect in its effect. The intellect works by fits and starts. But the mind is always active within us. Desire, pride, anger, vanity, envy, sorrow – all such aberrations are generated by the mind. Therefore the man desirous of culture should first of all clean up the mind or cultivating fine art and the company of cultivated people. That is the reason why usually, people believe that culture means music and literature, myths and legends. In actual fact, poetry, music, dancing and painting are not the entire body of culture; they are only some parts of it. The inner transformation effected by those form the necessary pre-requisites for culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Man’s mind gets purified by the great influence of the works</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">112    /   sa÷skÅti   <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.   D.V.

Ramayana and the Mahabharata bring us experiences of life not easily available; As a result of this our inner vision gets refined; our area of interest gets enlarged. The goal of life gets ennobled. This maturity of life – awareness is the ultimate use of good literature. Similarly, the company of good people brings us great experiences and extremely sophisticated ones too.

That is culture. That which happens consciously over and above what happens naturally is culture; if something stays the same as it was at its birth, it is nature, civilization is culture. It is nature when different kinds of flowers and leaves in a variety of colours shine forth. When they are gathered and made into a garland or a bouquet, it is culture. Mother Nature provides us with the raw materials for our livelihood. We use it in a proper context to yield meaning to our lives. That is culture. To convert a forest into a garden is culture. To comb it neatly, weave it into an artistic braid and decorate it with flowers is culture. That which has come into existence by itself is nature. When man tames into an intellectual order is culture. The various kinds of hungers of our body are nature. The orderly and meaningful way these are appeared according to the proper time, place and manner is culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">Culture is not confined merely to a pleasing appearance and beautiful speech. That is external culture. Superior to that is inner, innate culture. Desires and emotional involvements are nature. A sense of justice and discrimination is culture. Anger and envy are nature; forgiveness and tolerance are culture. Thus in matters of mind, body speech, there is room for culture. Culture reaches its pinnacle in the mind’s nobility. When there is nobility in the mind, when there is beauty there – that nobility and beauty finds its external manifestation in our voice, speech, facial expression and courtesy in our behaviour.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then two things happen:</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: justify;">Firstly, happiness takes place in the hearts of those with whom we are dealing with.

And, we have to make an adjustment to their mentality our own attitude to life. Thus the process of an individual making a friendly adjustment and correcting oneself suitably many be called culture.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h4 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Story of the Cow</h4><P style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Well, what does one person adjusting himself to another exactly mean? In our story of the cow, does the cow adjust itself to the wishes of the tiger? Or, does the tiger become obedient to Punyakoti the cow? A tiger catching hold of a cow and eating it is natural, that is nature. The tiger admiring of truthfulness of the cow is culture. The cow confessing about the calf is culture. The tiger responding and showing sympathy is a cultural response. The culture residing in the cow became the cause for the culture in the tiger.</P><P style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">It has already been suggested that when culture reaches its summit, it becomes the principle for the establishment of a relationship between two lives. What is “life”? It is the combination of two objects; one part of it is the conglomorations of the body and the sense organs; the other is the self or the soul. The sense organ desires the comforts of the world; the soul hankers after a consciousness higher than itself. Culture has got both these aspects in view; Worldly comfort and elevation of the soul.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">116    /   sa÷skÅti   <span class="s2">   </span>Dr.   D.V.    Gundappa</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There is a common feeling among men that both these are mutually opposed to each other. It is the conceptual belief of culture that they are not opposed to each other but are complementary and helpful. They are like two steps; it is not possible to ascend the second step without ascending the first. The first step was useless unless the second was ascended. There is a place for both steps in a man’s life. When once it is accepted that in an animal called man the most paramount thing is an element called Self, it becomes proper for all other aspects of life the basics of the substratum for the attainment of that Supreme Goal. There are a thousand things we want in life. Among them there are some which are of lasting value, and some which are momentary enjoyment. Each one of them has its own proper place. It has its value in that specific place. In other places, it appears undesirable. The delicious sweet rice, instead of falling into the mouth falls on the thigh or lap it is disgusting. In keeping with this, there is a saying in English. A thing out of its place is dirt. That object which leaves its own deserved place and places itself in another is dirt. This same principle can be applied to administrative matters also. A police constable can arrest a guilty person and present him before a magistrate. That is his duty. But if he exceeds his jurisdictory duty and conducts a trial himself and awards a sentence, then it is dirt. Similarly if a magistrate himself sets out to arrest a culprit, then it is dirt. To search for and bring an outlaw to justice is a policeman’s duty, not the magistrate’s. Thus each position or office has its own limits. Knowing these limits and giving each thing the value it deserves is justice. Justice itself is culture.</P><P style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Thus assigning each object in the world its proper place is the job of culture. Determing the importance of each place is also the province of culture. All in all, the propriety of our actions itself is culture. There are two principles to this propriety –</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Culture / 117</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><ol id="l13"><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">The Self I supreme. Therefore it deserves universal respect; (2) Because the Self is found in everyone as it is found in me and in the same way, I must value the sorrow and joys of others the same way as I value them in me. Thus if I owe a duty and responsibility to others, along with it, it becomes incumbent on my part to know their feelings and desires. Thus knowing what others feel becomes a part of culture. First the knowledge of their expectations; then propriety of behaviour as a consequence of it.</P></li></ol><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Of the various aspects of man, isn’t the self the highest? The Self is the same in everybody. Therefore superiority and inferiority don’t exist in the matter of the supreme Self. But worldly things are not like that. There, depending on the differences in their intelligence and mind, the values of things change. For one man eating is important; for another, looks. One man prefers a round face; another an oval one; one man likes sweets; another hot and pungent stuff. One lady prefers jasmine; another champak. One woman likes apparel; another music. One man gets angry soon and also forgets it soon. Another man takes a long time to get angry and doesn’t forget it even after twelve years. One man is trusting and doesn’t think for himself. Another cannot trust anyone and he thinks too much. Thus in mankind, there are dozens of varieties of mentalities, intellectual abilities and moral outlooks and these are found in various levels. A cultured man understands these levels and adjusts his talk and behaviour to the situation on hand. No matter what the circumstance, his endeavour is for creating wellbeing.</P><P style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Here we must notice that what is good is different from what brings happiness. There are moments when they both get together, there are moments when they stand apart. For a drunkard drinking brings happiness, it is not good.

For a good student a time schedule is good as well as beneficial.</P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Happiness satisfies the senses first. After cogitation whether it is good or bad is known to the intellect. What is beneficial is first cognized by the mind. Afterwards, even if the experience does not bring happiness to the mind, we receive it willingly. A beautiful girl who loves to decorate herself with ornaments suffers the pain of getting her ears pierced receives it as desirable. Such is the nature of what is good. That which is received by the thoughtful discrimination is good. That is good which is approved by the self as such. That comfort which does not impede personal good is happiness.</P><P style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">The means and the case which shows us with example the various modes of understanding others’ minds and that which makes clear to our minds the sophisticated emotions in literature like poetry and drama, that which educates our intellect – this role is performed by the fine arts like music, stage presentation through acting, sculpture and painting. Thus the literary arts are the feeding elements for culture. In the Ramayana and the Mahabharata we can see plenty of examples of cultured behaviour.</P><ol id="l14"><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">When Sri Ramachandra and Lakshmana armed themselves with bows, arrows and swords and started to go to the forest, Sitadevi addressed her husband thus “My lord, when fighting weapons are in one’s arms, they are capable of engendering a cruel frame of mind, there is the fear that innocent people might come to harm form you”. After giving this warning and after mentioning an incident in such a circumstance, she adds at the end: “Lord, I have not spoken to teach you something you don’t know; the love and respect I have for you have made me remind you of your own opinion”.</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Culture / 119</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><P style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Sita spoke Dharma. To whom? To the very personification of all Dharma Therefore, in addition to packing the thoughts of Dharma, she imparted humble politeness. This is propriety.</P></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><P style="display: inline;">At the Kurukshetra the armies of the Pandavas and the Kauravas are gathered ready for battle. When everyone was in the middle of that enthusiastic expectancy, Dharmaraya got off from his chariot and walked barefoot towards the enemy camp. His brothers and friends mistakenly thought that out of fear he was walking across to surrender and tried to prevent him. What did he do?

Everybody is able to recognize it the moment they come across it as a special attraction. The path of culture is not fraught with roughness and obstinacy; it is a path of smoothness and politeness. What is the difference between a life without grace and finesse and that of dog which rushes forward to grab the leftovers?</P><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Cosmic Man</h1><P style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></P><h2 style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">C<span class="p">ulture means the education of the Self – the education of the Self which takes into account the entire universe.</span></h2><P style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">When culture attains its full fruition, then man becomes the universal man.
