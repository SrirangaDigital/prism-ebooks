<H3>Dedication </H3>
<P>I dedicate this book to Feroz Siddiqui, my son – an <em>Achiever</em>. </P>
<P>His success is not lopsided; he scales heights keeping an eye on the ‘Hereafter’. </P>
<P>His obedience to bosses is not <em>surrender</em>; he champions their </P>
<P>hearts giving success-results. </P>
<P>His escalation is satisfying to my heart </P>
<P>yet I keep him on my mental scanner, </P>
<P>without interfering or interceding, </P>
<P>but conversing with his soul </P>
<P>through the whispers of my heart, </P>
<P>not sometimes, always. </P>
<P>That’s what is the role of a father, I suppose! </P>

<H3>Foreword </H3>
<P>Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second Prime Minister (PM) of India was not exactly the “boss” of Dr. Verghese Kurien, best known as the “Father of the White Revolution”. But I would like to briefly narrate an incident involving these two outstanding individuals, and how Shastriji got some work done through Dr. Kurien. I am sharing this story because it illustrates a few of the points that Prof. Moid Siddiqui powerfully brings out in this book. </P>
<P>Shastriji had heard of the wonderful results that Dr. Kurien had achieved in the milk co-operative in Anand, and wanted this success to spread to other parts of the country. To begin with, the then PM was a person with a keen understanding of the farming sector. So he wanted to gain a first-hand understanding of how Anand had achieved its stupendous success. In an unprecedented move, he decided to spend a night in one of the villages in Anand as a guest of a small farmer. He felt that this would give him an opportunity to explore the issue at the grassroots level and help him gain certain personal insights. He walked around the village, spoke to several farmers and tried to discover the secret of Anand’s success. </P>
<P>When the PM met Dr. Kurien the following day, he mentioned that despite his efforts, he had failed to learn the secret of why Anand was successful while the other government cooperatives were such unmitigated disasters. “<em>I looked at the soil here; it is good but not as good as the Indo-Gangetic plain</em>,” said the PM. “<em>I looked at your climate, and there is nothing special there. The rainfall pattern </em></P>
<P><em>is similar to what it is in large parts of India. I expected this place to be green with contented cows grazing, but this place is brown. Your buffaloes don’t look as good as the buffaloes I remember in Uttar Pradesh. While farmers are all good people, your farmers don’t appear as hard working as the Punjabi farmers. So I cannot find a single reason why Anand is such a great success</em>”. </P>
<P>Dr. Kurien responded: “<em>Sir, the main difference is that this dairy is owned by farmers, and managed by their elected representatives. They have employed me as a professional manager to run this dairy. I am an employee of the farmers, not on deputation from the government. If I don’t satisfy the farmers, I don’t get merely transferred – I lose my job.When they produce more milk, I am expected to find market. I can never say that I can’t collect more. When they tell me to increase productivity, I have to think of ideas such as cattle feed or inputs to farmers. So this dairy is sensitive to the needs of the farmers. In the other dairies in India, this is not the case. In the absence of responsiveness and support in obtaining the inputs, managing their processes or marketing their outputs, farmers are unable to improve their production and productivity. Anand shows that what is true of New Zealand or Holland is true of India also</em>”. The PM listened attentively and said softly, “<em>In other words, you’re saying that Anand’s success can be replicated</em>”. When Dr. Kurien nodded his agreement, Shastriji said, “<em>Now I want you to achieve the same result at the national level. That is the challenge that I want you to take up</em>”. That marked the formation of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the initiation of ‘Operation Flood’ that transformed India from being a milk-deficient nation to the largest milk producer in the world. </P>
<P>In the above incident, Shastriji clearly displayed a number of qualities of positive bosses that Prof. Siddiqui talks about in this interesting book. First, he was a great learner – showing curiosity while being focused on achieving a larger purpose, trying to learn from not only own experience, but also from the experience of others, listening, demonstrating humility, and involving himself in a free and open conversation. As a Pygmalion leader, he inspired Dr. Kurien to take up the challenge of creating on a national canvas what he had achieved in Anand. </P>
<P>At the same time, Dr. Kurien serves as a role model for a competent professional. In line with what Prof. Siddiqui writes, he viewed the Prime Minister, an individual in higher position neither as an adversary nor as an object of flattery. He communicated his views clearly, frankly and persuasively. Then he utilized the opportunities provided to him by making significant contributions to a larger cause. Rather than merely “taking a role” that was defined for him by the organization or the larger system, Dr. Kurien actively “shaped his role” by articulating his views openly but constructively, initiating new ideas and displaying commitment. </P>
<P>This book consistently advances an important idea. As Prof. Siddiqui demonstrates through numerous examples, a number of bosses and subordinates in organizations limit themselves to <em>position power</em>. They only think of tangible aspects such as titles, positions, rewards and punishments. By doing so, they get people to achieve, at best, <em>conformity</em> to instructions. They are never able to generate commitment. For commitment, willing acceptance has to flow from below. This will happen only when managers go beyond issues at cognitive or rational level and address any emotional and relationship matters that have not been explicitly spoken about, but form a part of the employee concerns. As these leaders take a comprehensive perspective of head, heart and gut level issues, interactions with them become attractive for the followers. These leaders also provide opportunities for pursuing learning and excellence. Such a leadership approach gives <em>personal power </em>to the bosses<em>,</em> and so they gain <em>commitment </em>of their subordinates. </P>
<P>Peter Drucker, considered the father of modern management </P>
<P>once wrote that we spend a lot of time helping leaders learn what to do. He argued that we don’t spend enough time helping leaders learn what to stop. Prof. Moid Siddiqui gives valuable tips on what behaviors rob leaders of their effectiveness. These are things that leaders should stop. They should stop focusing only on the negative aspects, evaluating in a manner that saps people of their energy and enthusiasm, or being excessively preoccupied with blowing their own trumpet. Instead, the leaders should accentuate the positive, catch people doing right things, provide understanding, and be committed to own and others’ learning. He makes these points through case illustrations and personal experiences that are engaging, witty and persuasive. I am sure that the readers will not only enjoy reading this book, but will also gain from it valuable insights for enhancing their own effectiveness both as bosses and as followers. </P>

<H3>Preface </H3>
<P>Bosses are not <em>bête noire</em>! Yet many regard them as their adversaries. We forge ahead with this mistaken view without understanding our boss’s nature, habits and preferences. Bosses too are human beings and like every human being, they also have their own likes and dislikes. What is needed is a bit of adjustment here and there. A bit of tinkering! </P>
<P>You cannot change the world. You have to adjust (perhaps even change) with the world. This does not warrant that you have to leave behind your own principles and ideals. What is required is a positive mind-set; one that is capable of seeing the world with a different perspective to understand its positive aspects. Likewise, you cannot change the habits of your boss or force him to change his set of likes and dislikes. You have to adjust (maybe even change) with him. You need to develop a new mind-set to understand him and this entails adopting a different perspective to positively interact with him. Your job is to motivate your juniors, educate and train them so as to get the best output from them. You are paid for doing this. You are not paid to educate and train your bosses. Many develop this mistaken notion and get into relationship problems with their bosses. If our bosses are really our <em>bete noire</em>, we have made them so. We have never tried to understand them. You always get what you look for. Keep the focus on the solution, not on the problem. The good news is that bosses can be influenced and inspired. All that we need to do is show patience and decency. There is really only one route to reach out to them – through the route of your heart. </P>
<P>Exceptions are always there and we cannot shy away from the </P>
<P>realities of our personal life and corporate life. Yes, there are difficult bosses. But all difficult bosses are not bad; only some are bad. The ‘bad’ bosses fall in the category of ‘exception’! </P>
<P>The World has changed and this has changed the Corporate World as well. Those who have many complaints about their bosses have not seen the bosses of the past. In yesterday’s World, many would have become bosses by virtue of seniority. Departments and disciplines like administration, public relations, accounts, personnel and welfare were the <em>babus’</em> paradise – clerks and account clerks could rise to the highest positions in the course of time. Even in the technical departments, skilled workers with ITI qualifications or short-term diplomas used to get senior positions. Those were the difficult days where ‘good bosses’ were the exception. Today, the situation is different. Bad bosses now fall into the category of ‘exception’. </P>
<P>If you go to the roots of ‘Boss-hood’ or ‘Boss-ship’ you will discover that the first boss was a ‘Foreman’ whose role in the factories and mines was just the same as the role of a Ringmaster in the circus. A great transformation has taken place since then. In fact, I am a witness to such transformations. Even in those days, when the use of the whip was not considered ‘bad’, I have seen many ‘self-inspired’ Ringmasters without any whip in their hands. </P>
<P>Have we ever tried to find out who were the ancestors of bosses? The ancestors of bosses were ‘Masters’ in the epoch of slavery and ‘Landlords’ in the era of ‘agricultural society’. Industrial society has evolved from ‘agricultural society’. Obviously, some ailments of the earlier societies are bound to exist. The transformation of industrial society into knowledge society has brought about a significant change in leadership styles. The Corporate World has changed significantly. Though it has worsened in many aspects (due to its materialistic and capitalistic approach) it has, however, shown a remarkable improvement in the area of leadership. </P>
<P>“Companies used to be able to function with autocratic bosses. We do not live in that world any more.” These words of Rosabeth Moss Kanter - a great management Guru and the author of many well-known management books, viz. ‘The Change Masters’, ‘Super Corp’, ‘e-Volve’- should be written in gold. </P>
<P>Times have since changed. In fact, I find a sea change! With the advent of the IT industry and ‘Knowledge’ now the Goddess of Worship, the position has drastically changed. Management books and training workshops on the theme of ‘Leadership’, ‘Motivation’, ‘Team work’ and ‘Inter-personal relationships’ are the major contributory factors for causing transformation in today’s bosses. Authors like Ken Blanchard and Dr Stephan R Covey must be given the lion’s share of credit for bringing about change in the mind-set of many CEOs. This book is also a humble attempt in the same direction. </P>
<P>Yet, ‘how to get along well with the bosses’ is still an issue. This fact cannot be denied. Though such ‘unmanageable’ bosses may be insignificant in number, they do pose a problem. </P>
<P>In my workshops, I always get suggestions from managers and senior managers that I should first train their bosses. It is their bosses who should first learn the lessons of ‘leadership’ . Many share their problems and issues with bosses. Many say, “I have joined the company because the company is very good. But I shall soon be leaving the company because of one single person – the boss!” Many delegates requested me to author a book on this burning issue. Though there are many books on this important theme, most of them fall in the category of ‘In the Wonderland of Indian Administrators’ – sarcastic and caustic, and projecting the boss as a villain or a buffoon. I do not subscribe to such frivolous solutions for this serious problem. Yet such solutions do crop up from a few misguided missiles. </P>
<P>I am lucky to have had good bosses in abundance. However, the ‘normal bell curve’ was not an exception. I did face some typical bosses; a couple of them were very difficult to get along with. In fact, many of them became my favourite bosses when I just scratched the surface and located their inner selves. In this book I have shared some of my real experiences relevant to this theme. I have tried my best to avoid hype as well as sarcasm by adhering to authenticity in reporting my personal experiences. I have dealt with 14 varieties of bosses, ranging from ‘Pygmalion’ to ‘Gotcha’ bosses with nuances of pleasant and unpleasant profiles. You will find that the negative variety of bosses is more in number! This does not indicate that they form the majority. I have projected many varieties of negative bosses purposely as they need to be ‘corrected’; they should get benefit from this book. As Norman Schwarzkopf rightly observes, “You learn far more from negative leadership than from positive leadership. Because you learn ‘How not to do it’, and therefore, you learn ‘How to do it’.” </P>
<P>While assigning ‘titles’ to the bosses , I have used some existing titles and also coined many new titles which may become management metaphors tomorrow My prize-winning book, ‘The Brave New Manager’, published by McGraw Hill ( 1995), created the metaphor ‘Brave New Manager’. </P>
<P>If my work helps managers to have a good relationship with their bosses, and grants wisdom to some Gotcha bosses to correct themselves, I will know that I have finally attained corporate <em>Nirvana</em>. </P>

<H2>1. Stone-age Bosses </H2>
<P>A management Guru visits a site where some people were breaking stones at the foot of a rocky hillock. He asks one stone-breaker, “What are you doing?” The man angrily retorts, “Can’t you see? I am breaking stones!” He apologizes and goes to another stone-breaker and repeats the same question. This man’s passionate reply was astonishing. He says, “I am building a beautiful temple!” The management Guru purposely asks, “But I don’t see any temple here. I can only see that you and the others are busy breaking the stones.” “No,” insists this stone-breaker, “I am not simply breaking stones. Though I am breaking stones, I know that these stones are being transported to the site where a magnificent temple is being built. These stones are used in building the beautiful temple.” He pauses and asks, “Am I not building the temple?” The management Guru nods his head in confirmation. </P>
<P>The first stone-breaker had a myopic approach; the second one had developed a holistic approach and therefore, could see the bigger picture. In the Corporate World, we find that many managers and bosses are breaking rocks rather than building a temple. Stone-age bosses are myopic in approach. They only break the rocks without seeing the bigger picture through a holistic approach. </P>
<P>During my over three decades of experience in Corporate India, I have worked with many ‘Stone-age’ bosses. </P>
<P>It is not that easy to get along with Stone-age bosses. They are difficult people. Most of them reach the position of envy not by growing but by swelling. They do not grow; they simply swell. </P>
<P>Swelling is not growth; swelling is the symptom of a disease. Since they do not update their knowledge and skills, and never try to mend their attitude, they lose the competency required for the position they occupy. These are the guys who superannuate before attaining the real age of superannuation. </P>
<P>Stone-age bosses suffer from many inner deficiencies. One such deficiency is their lack of knowledge and limited vocabulary. Once I was travelling by train with my cricket team to participate in the Inter-Unit Sports Meet hosted by BHEL Bhopal. It was a 2tier AC Coach. I was representing the BHEL (R&amp;D), Hyderabad Cricket team, as the non-playing manager. Our young players were mostly engineers and scientists – very cultured and sober people. At night I woke up on hearing the noise of shouting and quarrelling. Being the team manager, I had to take care of my team players. I got up and rushed to the berths where the quarrel was taking place. </P>
<P>I found that one of my engineers, R Krishnan, was having a heated argument with a politician – an MP. (Later I came to know he was Venkat Swami, a popular political leader in those days). On enquiring as to what was the cause of the dispute, Krishnan told me, pointing his finger towards the leader, “This fellow called me, ‘You bloody fool!’.” Then he narrated the full story. It appears that the MP along with his party-man boarded the train at the last station. He was allotted the upper berth but he wanted to occupy the lower berth. Instead of making a request, he ordered Krishnan to vacate the lower berth on which he was sleeping and go to the upper berth. Since his attitude was very rude, Krishnan refused to oblige him. This annoyed Venkat Swami who shouted at Krishnan using the words, “You bloody fool!” This remark sparked the situation out of control and other team players also joined Krishnan and gave the leader a mouthful of angry words. </P>
<P>By the time I intervened, the khadi-clothed leader had become sober. Perhaps he had understood that he was barking up the wrong tree or rather had caught a Tartar! He never thought that the young man and his team players would pay him back with more harsh words. Gradually tempers cooled down with the interference of the leader’s companion, who seemed to be a mature and well-educated person. Krishnan, as a good gesture, offered his lower berth to the leader and went to the upper berth. </P>
<P>Later, the leader’s companion talked to me in a low tone. “Sir, your young man became upset for nothing. What your engineer didn’t realize was that my MP <em>gaaru</em> doesn’t know English. Your engineer went on arguing with him in English. My MP also wanted to respond to him in English. He uttered what he knew. Believe me, Sir! He doesn’t know English except for these three words ‘You Bloody Fool!’.” I could not control my laughter and he joined me wholeheartedly, looking at the berth where his ‘Stone-age’ boss was sleeping, whistling out loud snores! </P>
<P>Stone-age bosses know their deficiencies well but will not openly admit it. But there are some Stone-age bosses who are ignorant of their obsolescence. What they had learnt eons ago they consider still relevant in the new age. They remain ignorant of their ignorance. The problem is not their ignorance; the problem is the ignorance of their ignorance. Such bosses, who are not even aware of their obsolescence, are irreversible. They take pride in sharing their obsolescence with people without any sense of professional guilt. There is no feeling of guilt because they never realize that their rusted knowledge does not make any sense in this new age. </P>
<P>Some bosses possess sound technical knowledge yet remain weak in some other areas because they have never attempted to widen the scope of their knowledge. </P>
<P>One such boss that comes to my mind is SS Jain (not his real name). He was my colleague in National Hydro-electric Power Corporation (NHPC). In 1970, I was posted in Baira Siul Hydroelectric Project near Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. SS Jain was an Executive Engineer who was a technical expert with one weakness </P>
<P>– lack of proficiency in speaking English. His personal secretary was quite good in English. He knew his boss’s weakness. So, whenever he wanted to get some favour from his boss, he used to go to him and ask him to give him some dictation. This was his boss’s weak point. Even if he was angry on some issue he would calm down when someone touched his weak point. Many times he would say, “I gave dictation yesterday, didn’t I?” His secretary would then remind him that it was not yesterday but a month back when he gave the dictation by reading out from the written text. This would make the boss very nervous. He would virtually beseech his secretary to give him a day’s time; he would surely dictate a few letters tomorrow! Seeing the iron hot, the secretary would coolly ask some favour from him with an implicit understanding that he would not insist on dictation anymore. This way he used to blackmail his boss quite innovatively and get many favours from him. SS Jain would prefer to give him a couple of days off ‘unofficially’ as an implicit bargain – <em>better you be away and enjoy yourself but do not trouble me. </em></P>
<P>Unlike SS Jain, some Stone-age bosses are blind to their ignorance. They do not want to learn for they are complacent, over-confident and have out-grown the heights of incompetence. If attempts are made to educate them, they mistake their <em>well wishers </em>to be their <em>bête noire</em>. </P>
<P>There is another species of Stone-age bosses who are known as ‘fence sitters’. A fence-sitter boss is a special species of the Stone-age boss. Peter Block, the author of the famous book ‘The <SPAN>Empowered Manager’, describes the fence-sitter boss as someone who will simply not take a stand <em>for</em> or <em>against</em>. In most of the cases it is observed that at the end of the meeting conducted by a fence-sitter boss, we are never quite sure whether a decision has been made or not! Sometimes at such meetings, the need for clarity of objectives and goals is discussed with so much ambiguity that everything seems to be clear when the discussion is on but as soon as we walk out of the room this clarity evaporates. </SPAN></P>
<P>The Stone-age boss, who is in the habit of sitting on the fence, forgets the cardinal principle of decision-making – <em>it is too dangerous to be over cautious in decision making</em>. “To be cautious and noncommittal is an easy state of mind. The fence-sitter boss is the bureaucratic proto-type. To the bureaucratic mind, danger is in the foreground and opportunity is in the background,” observes Peter Block in his book ‘The Empowered Manager’. </P>
<P>A Stone-age boss is definitely a disaster hunter. A disaster hunter is an addictive personality with shades of workaholism. “Deep down, he doesn’t mind the prospect of his eventual demise. Part of him, in fact, is going about the task of actively creating that final solution, hunting his own disaster with all the energy that his madness imparts,” believes Stanley Bing. And PJO Rourke affixes the final seal for recognizing these species of patriarchy by saying, “There is one thing to say about crazy bosses. It’s horribly, terribly, sadly, thoroughly, hopelessly, gruesomely true.” </P>
<P>It is not very difficult to recognize the Stone-age bosses. They have some specific <em>likes</em> and <em>dislikes</em> and also exhibit certain typical characteristics: </P>
<P><SPAN>• <em>Hierarchy</em> is their first love. They strongly believe and religiously follow the practice of ‘Through Proper Channel’. They are upset if someone deviates from the </SPAN>principle of hierarchy. If the choice exists between ‘Through Proper Channel’ and ‘Urgency’, they will say, “Urgency is understandable, but management principles cannot be butchered for the sake of whims and fancies – let things move only ‘through the proper channel’!” </P>
<P>Following the defined rules and regulations is considered the purpose of their existence. If there is a choice between ‘to follow the procedure’ scrupulously or ‘to meet the company’s objectives and business goals’, they will follow the former without any feeling of ‘professional guilt’. </P>
<ul>
<LI>Their leadership style creates an ‘anti-empowerment’ environment (patriarchal environment). They not only believe in but also consciously work for ‘Patriarchal’ values and strong ‘controls’ to enjoy power. </LI>
<LI>They believe in controls and confines. Flexibility, fluidity and the desired ambiguity are grossly mistaken by them as management lapses and therefore, they control these under the garb of strict rules and regulations. This way they make their presence felt by ‘breaking stones’ and displaying their Stone-age managerial skills. </LI>
<LI>Their only wisdom is ‘conventional wisdom’. </LI>
<LI>They prefer ‘routine’ to ‘creativity’ – following the beaten track is their normal path. </LI>
<LI>They look for loyalties in the guise of searching for competency amongst their people. </LI>
<LI>Stone-age bosses strongly believe in ‘uni-functionalism’. They are loyal to the discipline they belong to. They strongly believe in ‘territories’ and therefore, create ‘watertight compartments’ and ‘discipline silos’ in the organization. </LI>
<LI>Cost-cutting in distress – ‘chop, chop, chopping’ is considered the only medicine for all corporate diseases. </LI>
<LI>They see a business as a huge machine; made up of departments and disciplines with employees as ‘cogs’ to produce the product. They are unkind to emotions, commitments and involvement of employees and therefore, fail to assess the losses caused by the withdrawal of the ‘shares of commitment’ by the dissatisfied subordinates. </LI>
<LI>They strive to achieve self-sufficiency (with the intention to have more control) without realizing that ‘interdependence’ is not a blasphemy amidst the sweeping winds of change. </LI>
<LI>They are not inclined towards ‘experimentation’ – they never tolerate failures and wilfully deny rewarding a ‘good attempt’. </LI>
<LI>Most of them are not good listeners. </LI>
<LI>They talk about the importance of ‘human resources’ but never do anything about it seriously. HRD is used as a decorative frill. </LI>
<LI>They are never sure of the direction in which they are leading their people. They lack clarity and do not have a mental map of the various segments and activities, which need to be integrated. </LI>
<LI>They lack a holistic approach. They manage through ‘snapshots’. </LI>
<LI>They are not clear about the principles on which the success of their business is based. They confuse their people and pass on their confusion to them. This confusion generates more confusion. </LI>
<LI>They do not know how to stay simple. They expand and make the organization top heavy. This only further complicates the issues. </LI>
</ul>
<SECTION>
<H3>Stone-age bosses dislike </H3>
<ul>
<LI>Making people feel they are important. </LI>
<LI>Respecting the dignity and honour of people. </LI>
<LI>Trusting people. </LI>
<LI>Creating a transparent work culture. On the contrary, they believe in maintaining too many confidentialities; “I have the relevant information but it will be revealed only at the appropriate time”. The ‘appropriate time’ never comes. </LI>
<LI>Supporting people to take risk. </LI>
<LI>Stone-age boss loves to hate computers and IT technology. </LI>
<LI>Making people feel that they are co-partners in the change process through openness in sharing information and transparency in functioning. </LI>
<LI>Involving people - right from ‘idea generation’ to ‘implementation’. </LI>
<LI>Demonstrating willingness to try out new ideas. </LI>
<LI>Delegating and decentralizing the work. </LI>
<LI>Demonstrating seriousness and commitment to transforming the organization. </LI>
<LI>Identifying ‘strategic actions’ and evolving ‘action plans’ for converting ideas into reality. They prefer ‘status quo’; they love status quo. </LI>
</ul>
<P>Stone-age bosses harm the organization and bring down the morale of the people. They are the main cause of the corporate deadly disease known as ‘Injellititis’. “Hard times are sending some bosses back to the Stone Age,” observes Walter Keichel III in his article ‘When Management Regress’. “Beware yo-yo empowerment, cost-cutting mania, and the new McCarthyism… When the business went South, the brass sucked all the decision making back up to the top. Many organizations retreat from power sharing and open internal communication.” When such retreat takes place, people of competence choose not to interfere and sulk. They find their way out and leave the organization. This aggravates the disease and slowly the deadly disease ‘Injellititis’ brings the organization to a state of coma. </P>
<P>What is ‘Injellititis’? When the organization keeps focus on internal issues by giving precedence to rules, regulation and procedures, and allows the customer, market and external factors to go out of focus, the company suffers a deadly ‘corporate disease’ </P>
<P>– Parkinson calls it Injellititis! I am quoting a few symptoms of this deadly disease: </P>
<ul>
<LI>Work expands so as to fill the time available – everyone keeps busy to justify his position and workload. </LI>
<LI>Action expands to fill the void created by human failure – everyone sweats it out cleaning the soiled floor without much value addition for the customer. </LI>
<LI>Expenditure rises to meet income – and tends to surpass it. </LI>
<LI>Delay in throughput and output by the employees. The management delay in rewarding its people hastens the incubation time of the disease. Delay is the deadliest form of denial – Stone-age bosses do not understand this. </LI>
<LI>The time spent on any item in the agenda will be in </LI>
</ul>
<P>inverse proportion to ‘customer focus’ – more time than required is given to non-issues. </P>
<P>This brings the company to a stage which we call <em>coma</em>. At this stage, some peculiar tendencies can be witnessed. For instance: </P>
<ul>
<LI>People at the helm of affairs are seen plodding and walking heavily. </LI>
<LI>Stone-age bosses remain active in intrigue and scheming against the high-fliers, technocrats, marketing guys etcetera so as to put them down with the power of rules and procedures. They are fastened with the rules and silenced with the NIGYSOB (Now I Got You Son Of…). </LI>
<LI>The hangmen gain strength by virtue of the code of conduct and the disciplinary and appeal rules of the company. They grow powerful. Holding the noose, they search for competent-risk-taking managers who have the guts to defy rules and override the procedures in the interest of the business and the customer – the beginning of the ‘<em>Escapism’ </em>game<em>. </em></LI>
<LI>Committed people begin to withdraw their intellectual and emotional investment and do not flex their risk-taking muscles. </LI>
<LI>Dissent is not tolerated. It is considered as insubordination or disobedience. </LI>
<LI>If the Stone-age boss is second rate, he will see to it that his immediate staff is third-rate and, in turn, they see to it that their subordinates are fourth-rate. </LI>
<LI>Smugness is the cardinal symptom. Everyone is seen hitting the target – either the bull’s eye is too big or the sitting duck is at too short a distance. </LI>
<LI>When the specialists observe the unique combination of ‘bureaucratic approach’ and lack of ‘internal focus’, they start withdrawing. </LI>
<LI>Sycophancy from top to bottom creeps into the hierarchy of the business system. </LI>
<LI>If such Stone-age-practices dominate the organizations, there is an actual competition in stupidity. </LI>
<LI>The high-fliers having diagnosed the disease – Corporate Injellititis – coolly find the fox holes as no one listens to them when they voice their words of caution from the roof-top. </LI>
<LI>No spark of intelligence is left in the whole organization </LI>
</ul>
<P>– the corporate bureaucrats talk about HRD and creativity without even understanding the basics of the softer aspects of business deals. </P>
<P>The final stage may linger on for years while the company slowly dies with the kiss of the Stone-age approach, leaving the corporate bureaucrats wondering – “I controlled ‘costs’ at all costs…!” “I followed the systems, rules and regulations so scrupulously and unerringly…!” </P>
<P>Strange! We defend our wrongs with more vigour than we do our rights! </P>
<P>The worst part is not that they behave like ’Stone-age Managers’ but that they take pride in being ‘Stone-age creatures’. </P>
<P>Death pops up no red flags on the CEO’s table. The company </P>
<P>eventually succumbs to the deadly disease. Like rats spread plague, the Stone-age managers and bosses are the carrier of this corporate disease, ‘Injelliititis’. </P>
<P>In HMT I had one such Stone-age boss. I was working as General Manager (Human Resource). The post of Director (HR) fell vacant before I attained the eligibility to compete for it. The opportunity went in favour of an external candidate. The position of Director HR went to RA Sharan (not his real name) on a platter. He was working in one of the sick public sector companies in Assam. Luck favoured him. He joined HMT as director HR. He was highly bureaucratic in his approach. After discussing the issues over the telephone or personally in his office, he would insist that a written document be given even for day-to-day routine matters. Building records and creating reports were given more priority than business results. He was highly power conscious. </P>
<P>Once he asked me, “Mr Siddiqui, I have often noticed that you exercise powers not delegated to you as per the ‘delegation of powers’ manual. I suggest you read the manual and restrain from approving certain notes which are beyond your competence.” He thought this advice might make me wiser. I simply replied, “Sharanji, so long as my signatures are honoured by the finance people and other departments, I will go on approving the proposals in the interest of this organization for speedy process. I have never read the manual known as ‘delegation of powers’, nor do I wish to read it. The day my signatures are not honoured, the paper that you will receive will be my resignation.” I boldly looked unwaveringly into his eyes. That was the last time he made any such comment. </P>
<P>Once RA Sharan called me to his room and came out with the suggestion to create an HR network of Bangalore-based public sector and private sector organizations. I appreciated his idea and promised that within a couple of days he would get an effective network with all the requisite data and information. After two days he called me and appreciated the efforts of my team and suggested that we host a business dinner for the HR Heads of the Bangalore-based organizations. I again appreciated his professional gesture. But he wanted me to calculate the expenses that would be incurred and to submit a note in writing giving details of the breakup of each cost. Since we had discussed this and I had already given him a rough idea of the expenses I thought such a note was not warranted at that stage as no final decision had been taken. I shared my views frankly and said, “Sharanji, we have discussed over a couple of hours the issue of hosting a dinner without arriving at any result. Before you took over, we used to arrange many business meetings over dinners in star hotels and clubs just by verbal instructions. Sanctions were obtained later to regularize the expenditures.” He smiled and said, “Mr. Siddiqui, those were hay days of HMT when the company was making good profits.” He looked at me, confident that he had caught me on the wrong foot. I replied, “Sharanji, it is just other way around. Since we were hosting many dinners and freely associating with our HR colleagues, HMT had its hay days.” He thought for a while and said, “Perhaps you are right. What you said to me makes good sense.” Then I explained to him the power of ‘collective consciousness’ which can create and un-create situations around us. Both war and peace are created by ‘collective consciousness’. He who sees all beings in his own self and his own self in all beings, loses all fear. Likewise, those who see all beings in his own self and his own self in all beings gains all love. We human beings are ‘inter-beings’. Even in the aloneness of solitude, between two human beings, like an invisible shadow, there exists an ‘inter being’! </P>
<P>RA Sharan thought for a while and said with a smirk on his face that made his his jaws prominently visible, “Siddiqui, your words are phonetic; they sound pleasant to the ears. But your thoughts are just poetic and make no sense in this material world.” I thought it better not to pursue the point further. It takes time to grow in wisdom. I could have argued with him that five-sensory personalities are near to <em>animality</em>. The Corporate World today is looking for multi-sensory personalities who can manage beyond the five sensory perceptions – Extra Sensory Perceptions (ESP). He thought he had won a point. My withdrawal from the argument was taken as a sign of his success. </P>
<P>He was a typical personality with a very soft exterior and a really hard interior. Such persons are difficult bosses. It took me many months to understand his real self. He was a classic case of a Stone-age boss. Many things that were common knowledge to even junior managers were Greek and Latin for him. Once he asked me, “Siddiqui, whenever I meet the Chairman, he asks me to create a Learning Organization in HMT. I don’t know what is meant by a ‘learning organization’.” I smiled and simply told him, “I will come back to you tomorrow.” </P>
<P>Next day I bought Peter Senge’s book ‘The Fifth Discipline’ and gifted the book to him. He was surprised. I told him that it explains in detail how to build a learning organization. Later we had many sessions. The ice was broken. He took me into his confidence and I gave my knowledge to him happily and with no regrets. </P>
<P>It was the turning point in our relationship. So long as I was contesting against him, he always tried to put me down. When I sincerely pondered upon this hostile situation by empathetically putting myself in his shoes, wisdom dawned to me. It was not his <SPAN>fault. He was working in a ‘C’ class public sector organization and had got his posting at a far-flung remote area. Obviously, he missed the opportunity of upgrading his knowledge and competencies. Once he lost his ‘pace’ in the fast moving business, he lost the race. It was not his fault. Had I been in his place, perhaps I too would have slipped into antiquity. This new wisdom helped me in changing my attitude towards him. Without giving him the feeling that he did not know many things, I started imparting knowledge to him during our informal meetings. I also presented him with a few important management books which he accepted gracefully. He understood that I was not his bête noire but his <em>shubh-chintak (well wisher)</em>. Things changed for the better. We worked together creating good synergy. </SPAN></P>
<P>I have read many case studies and created many myself but this case study, which I call ‘Daruwala’, is very relevant in this context. It depicts a live situation! In my sessions, I give this case study and ask people to enact the roles of Daruwala, Krishnan and Saxena. After they play the roles, I analyse the roles as well as the situation. Then I share with the participants the art of managing such ‘Daruwala Bosses’! </P>

<H3>How to Manage a Stone-age boss? </H3>
<P>It was a wet Monday morning in the suburbs of Bombay as Krishnan got out of bed and stared out of the window. “Another day,” he muttered to himself, “and another confrontation with Daruwala.” His mood reflected the gloomy, rain-threatening weather outside. “Surely, a 26 year-old MBA is meant for better things,” thought Krishnan. Struggling out of bed, his train of thought led him to reflect on how he had joined the Excel Bank a couple of years ago. </P>
<P>Shortly after completing his Masters in Economics </P>
<P>&amp; obtaining an MBA from a Premier Business institute, Krishnan, then a young man of 24 years, got a job as a Junior Executive in the Deposits Department of the Excel Bank, a private sector undertaking located at Flora Fountain. He was responsible for supervising 10 clerks who were engaged in accepting, processing and answering customer enquiries. He reported to the Manager-Retail Banking, Daruwala, who in turn reported to the Branch Manager, Saxena. The office staff reported directly to the Manager-Retail Banking. </P>
<P>He thought of his immediate superior, Daruwala. The 49-year old Daruwala had been with the bank for 20 years and had risen to his present position through hard work and perseverance. During his career, as a junior and later as a senior bank executive, he had watched the bank grow and progress. He often referred to the increase in the number of employees under his supervision with a great deal of pride. </P>
<P>His aversion to the ‘new breed of intellectuals and creative brains’, as he put it, coming into the bank was legendary. “These kind of people don’t know when good enough means good enough. These so-called ‘professional people’ can alienate customers and destroy the bank’s systems for they don’t have any experience” was Daruwala’s attitude towards the young creative breed of the bank’s managerial employees. Only the previous week Krishnan had overheard Daruwala remarks at the bar of the bank’s club. “I suspect their allegiances; they only demand autonomy,” Daruwala had asserted in no uncertain terms. “These guys think they are too smart and form an inner club with their own rules, and their loyalties appear to be with the technical specialty of their profession rather than <SPAN>with my bank.” (“<em>My bank</em>,” thought Krishnan; when had he bought it?) As he got ready for work, Krishnan reflected on the work he had to do at Excel Bank. </SPAN></P>
<P>According to Krishnan, his work at the bank was not challenging. His main duty was to verify the attendance of the office assistants each morning, to make sure that ‘everything was in order’, to answer queries concerning deposits and to meet the few depositors who dropped into the bank. </P>
<P>He also prepared special reports and monthly progress charts as and when required by the Branch Manager’s office or by Daruwala. But such occasions were rare. He did not have much work to do, and he estimated that on an average he worked for no more than three and half hours a day. </P>
<P>He also felt that the knowledge he had gained through his education was unutilized. </P>
<P>Krishnan was enthusiastic and confident of his own ability. After completing his training period, he developed some strong convictions concerning the supervision of the office employees. The high rate of absenteeism and the apathy of many of the employees towards their work irked him. He realized that he was new to the organization. Nevertheless, he suggested certain measures which he felt would improve the situation. Daruwala, however, paid no attention to the suggestions. In fact, Daruwala confided to a retired colleague of his that, “This new lot coming in have a major problem. To maintain their mystique and culture or because their language tends to be filled with technical or scientific jargon, they establish barriers between them and what they consider <em>lay</em> people like me. Well, Krishnan reports to me and his performance appraisal is coming up soon. He will soon learn <em>who</em> is the boss!” </P>
<P>To utilize his unproductive time, Krishnan suggested that as he had some knowledge about the modern techniques of banking he would like to take some lecture sessions for the employees on the new deposit-linked instruments available for the public. This would also improve their work efficiency. He volunteered to conduct these sessions once or twice a week as a part of his regular work without claiming any extra honorarium. But Daruwala did not feel that this suggestion was worth considering. Events soon began to crystallize into a confrontation. One day Mohanlal, a typist, suddenly fell ill and Krishnan permitted him to go home before closing time. Daruwala was not in the office at that time. When he came to know of this, Daruwala told Krishnan that the latter did not have the authority to take such decisions and in the future, all such cases should be referred only to him. Krishnan, however, felt that in the absence of Daruwala he had the right to take such decisions, and moreover, as Mohanlal’s sickness was genuine, he had taken the correct decision. </P>
<P>Some time back Banerjee, the Internal Auditor, had suggested some changes in the sitting arrangement of the staff in the banking hall to accommodate a new assistant who had recently joined the Internal Audit section. Krishnan was in favour of this but Daruwala did not agree to the suggestion as he felt that his section was already crowded. The matter was ultimately referred to the Methods Research section; it had to study the layout of the sitting arrangements. </P>
<P>On his way to work, Krishnan’s car suffered a flat tyre and this delayed him considerably. His mood, never happy at the best of times, had recently taken a new plunge where anger at his boss and frustration with his work were beautifully blended together. </P>
<P>Krishnan’s chance to vent his feelings was, however, destined to come sooner than he anticipated. The genesis of this chance was of recent origin. </P>
<P>As the bank was growing, the management had decided to instal a new electronic data processing centre for processing staff salary payments. Last week Saxena, the Branch Manager, had called Krishnan to his office as Daruwala was on leave. He thought that Krishnan, an MBA, would be able to add some new angle to the bank’s computerization plan. He spent about two hours with Krishnan explaining to him the objectives of the installation of the proposed system. He asked Krishnan to think over it and put up suggestions, if any. </P>
<P>Krishnan was enthusiastic about Saxena’s approach and had spent several hours over the weekend working out a plan that would permit the new computer to be installed in his area with minimum hassles. He submitted the plan to Saxena shortly thereafter. </P>
<P>Saxena was very impressed with Krishnan’s ideas and had called a meeting of the concerned officers, including Daruwala, today to review the plan. </P>
<P>At 2.30 p.m, Daruwala entered the office hall and slammed the folder containing Krishnan’s plan on his table. “What is this?” he asked angrily. Before Krishnan could reply, Daruwala began to lecture him in a loud voice about the necessity of going through ‘proper channels’ while submitting reports. These remarks attracted the attention of the staff in the banking hall. Most of the staff stopped their work to watch the disturbing scene. </P>
<P>Krishnan was much perturbed about this unforeseen situation and said in a loud voice, “Nothing, I have done nothing wrong.” But when he realized that people around him were watching them, he suggested that they might continue their discussion in Daruwala’s office, which was separated from the hall. Daruwala snatched the folder from Krishnan’s table and stormed into his own office. Krishnan followed sulkily. </P>
<P>What must have happened in the closed room is anybody’s guess! Daruwala shouted in his loud voice and ridiculed Krishnan, threatening that he would spoil his appraisals and see to it that his career was ruined. Daruwala, convinced that Krishnan was trying to keep him out of the loop on purpose to tarnish his image, paid no heed to any explanation given by Krishnan. </P>
<P>After the participants play the roles of Krishnan, Saxena and Daruwala, I ask them to analyse each character and find out the root-cause of the situation which had spiralled out of control. I also ask them to suggest the ways and means to handle such ticklish situations and bosses like Daruwala. </P>
<P>I ask the same questions to my readers. Ponder for a while and let me know the root-cause. Was it Saxena’s calling Krishnan and giving him the assignment directly the root cause? No, that incident was not the real root-cause. That incident only triggered the explosive situation. The volcano was already there; it could have erupted anytime. That particular incident was an ‘effect’ not the ‘cause’, let alone the root-cause. </P>
<P>Let us analyse the character of Daruwala to understand the personality profile of many ‘Stone-age bosses’. Daruwala was a sincere, loyal and experienced bank manager but he was bureaucratic, rigid and egoistic. </P>
<P>When does a person become ‘Egoistic’? A person becomes egoistic when he has some deficiencies in his personality. To cover these deficiencies he projects himself to be larger than life-size. He behaves in an egoistic manner which makes people think he is suffering from a ‘superiority complex’. But, most interestingly, Psychology does not recognize this ‘superiority complex’. Psychology recognizes only two types of complexes: (1) Inferiority complex and (2) Oedipus complex. A person behaves in a ‘superior’ manner to hide his ‘inferior’ feelings within. Since he suffers from an ‘inferiority complex’, he shows off his ‘superiority’ to cover his inner inferiority. </P>
<P>What was the inner deficiency of Daruwala? His inner deficiency was his ‘obsolete knowledge’. Though he was loyal, sincere and hard-working, somehow he lagged behind in the race as he could not brush up his existing knowledge. When Krishnan joined his team, Daruwala took him to be a great threat to his existence. Krishnan was professionally qualified with IT skills. He was a creative person who had many plans to innovate the banking system. Instead of taking all these positive qualities of Krishnan as the strength of the team, Daruwala regarded Krishnan as his rival. His apprehension was that ‘Krishnan would supersede him quickly’. And when Saxena called Krishnan directly and gave an important assignment to him, keeping Daruwala out of the loop, he felt his position at the bank was really ‘threatened’. As per his way of thinking, what he had apprehended turned out to be true. A very insignificant incident was made into a big issue and then he created bad blood by washing the dirty linen in public. </P>
<P>How to handle such situations? </P>
<P>Let me first explain how Krishnan should have managed the situation. In fact, this was a great opportunity for Krishnan to bury the hatchet by taking advantage of the situation. He should have simply contacted Daruwala, his immediate boss, over the phone and enquired about his health as he had not come to the office. Then, after winning Daruwala’s heart by this personal enquiry, he should have kept him informed about what had transpired between him and Mr.Saxena making it very clear that though, in view of the urgency, he had submitted the report to Mr.Saxena, he had kept a copy of the same for Daruwala’s perusal so that he could study and discuss it with Krishnan before meeting Mr.Saxena, the chief boss. This simple exercise could have helped not only in averting such a situation but also patched up the differences between the two of them. </P>
<P>Now let me explain how Daruwala could have taken ‘Krishnan’s posting’ to his department. He should have welcomed Krishnan as a part of his team. Both could have made a better complementary team – Daruwala’s experience and Krishnan’s knowledge. When knowledge is given the buttress of experience it creates miracles. When experience is added to knowledge it creates wonders. Daruwala could not understand this simple principle and lost a great opportunity. </P>
<P>In my understanding, <em>Daruwalas</em> in any given situation have only two options - (1) to collaborate with the <em>Krishnans</em> and create synergy by forgetting their ‘ego’ OR (2) to contest the <em>Krishnans </em>by learning the basics again themselves. </P>
<P><SPAN>If I were Daruwala, I would have talked to Krishnan frankly telling him that I could not upgrade my knowledge and skills and lost the pace in facing the challenges of present-day business. I would have, then, requested Krishnan to spend some time with me and help me to upgrade my knowledge and skills so that I can keep matching pace with modern times. It is a simple option but many will not avail of this option because one needs to kill one’s ego first. It is not a very simple option for people of ego. Alternatively, they must go for the second option. One should keep one’s foot on the chest of the computer and learn it. There is no third option to my way of understanding. <em>Daruwalas</em> survived yesterday, some have survived even today. But, believe me, </SPAN><SPAN><em>Daruwalas</em> will not have any place tomorrow. So, learn, learn and <em>learn</em>! </SPAN></P>
<P>Let me share with you the secret of my life. Had that incident not taken place, I too would have grown into a Daruwala. </P>
<P>This incident took place during my posting at the Baira Siul Project of NHPC – National Hydro-Electric Project. Let me first explain something about NHPC. It was a forcibly created public sector unit in the sense that all the projects which were carried out by ‘Central Public Works Development (CPWD)’ were assigned to the newly formed public sector unit, NHPC. There was no public sector culture, let alone ‘business culture’. Everyone was following the obsolete rules and regulations like FR (Fundamental Rules) or SR (Service Rules). There was no PMS – Performance Management System. NHPC, with the heritage of CPWD, was at the level of ‘Confidential Dossiers’ or ‘Confidential Reports’, popularly known as ACRs. When I was posted there as ‘Personnel Officer’, people mistook me to be the Personal Officer to the CEO. They were surprised as the CEO already had a Personal Secretary. Why then was an additional ‘Personal Officer’ attached to him? </P>
<P>I recall… </P>
<P>It was a spine-biting, chilly Sunday morning in the Himalayas. I was in a relaxed mood when I got a call from AS Chatrath, my CEO, who lived in one portion of the guesthouse built on the top of the hill. Our township was in the valley. He wanted me to join him for breakfast. I had two options – either to call for a jeep from the transport department or to climb up, following the zigzag shortcuts. I decided to climb the hill. </P>
<P>At the breakfast table, the silence was like a lull. The lull is a good indicator of a storm that is likely to follow! Between sips of hot coffee, he broke the silence by asking me point blank, “What is wrong with you?” Though I was prepared to face stormy weather after the lull, I was not ready for such a blunt question from Chatrath, my CEO. </P>
<P>“I haven’t understood you, Sir,” I replied politely and a bit diplomatically to gain some time for counting to 10 and allowing my ‘A’ – the Adult – to emerge from my frightened ‘C’ (Child ego-state) and compute a rationale answer. Frankly speaking, I could not make out what he meant! </P>
<P>“I am referring to the note which you had attached to the Manpower Plan of the Project,” he said. Now I remembered. I had put my name at the top in the list of ‘surplus executives’ at the project. “Are you not happy with me?” he asked, politely. </P>
<P>“No sir, there is nothing like that…,” I replied. </P>
<P>“Then why do you want to go? You know quite well how much I like your work. You also know how much I trust you. To be frank, I need you.” </P>
<P><SPAN>I was moved and just broke down – the ice was broken in the real sense. I explained to him how I was regarded as an odd-manout in the total project - governed by the FRs, SRs, CPWD manuals etc. (Fundamental Rules, Service Rules of the Central Government and Central Public Works Department’s manuals). All these did not jell with the concepts I was taught. These rules were meant to manage the Government machinery. They belonged to bureaucracy and not to entrepreneurship; the modern management and the scientific management techniques did not approve of bureaucratic practices. Here he stopped me by looking straight into my eyes and said, “I too was a young and energetic manager a couple of decades ago. I too tried to change the world. But the world didn’t change. Slowly I changed myself. Today you talk of ‘modern management’, ‘scientific management’ and arouse a strange feeling </SPAN>in me that I have become obsolete. After a couple of decades, you too will grow old like me and sit on this chair. And some young and smart junior executive will sit before you – as you are sitting today. Then, he will tell you, with more force than you told me today, that you have gone obsolete – your knowledge and your approach and your thoughts and your practices and your ideas do not conform with the modern management. Believe me, you will not relish the truth. What you think is modern management today will not be of any relevance tomorrow.” There was a silence – a deep silence, which was surely not a lull. </P>
<P>As it happens in any parable, it happened then. Wisdom dawned upon me. While returning from the CEO’s guesthouse, after making a strange compromise between old and modern thoughts, for the first time I realized the bare truth – everything that is modern today will be obsolete tomorrow. And I could not be an exception to such a natural phenomenon. The only antidote I could think of was to get back to the basics – “<em>Let the changing basics of every time be perfected,”</em> I firmly decided. I owe a lot to AS Chatrath whose brutal frankness made me wiser. </P>
<P>Since then I have been struggling hard for a face-lift. Yet, whenever I look in the mirror, I always see a Stone-age manager staring back at me and showing me the dust of obsolescence that has gathered on my very existence. The pace of change is much faster than I could ever visualise. I shiver in my spine even at the thought that tomorrow someone will come and sit before me and raise a finger at me saying, “You have gone obsolete. Your thoughts do not conform to modern management.” I get back to learning – learning from the seniors, from peers, from juniors and even from my own children. </P>
<P>More than three decades have passed. I never compromise with the issue of learning. Had that incident not taken place and wisdom not dawned on me, perhaps, I repeat, perhaps I might have grown as a Stone-age Boss creating problems for many and spoiling the careers of many, besides destroying many organizations. </P>
<P>Understand the psyche and background of the Stone-age Bosses and treat them as I treated RA Sharan and follow the tips I have given to Krishnan on the issue of “How should Krishnan have managed Daruwala” ! </P>
<P><em>Master Tip : </em><em>Remember one thing in life – you cannot choose your boss like you cannot choose your parents. When you understand this simple truth, the only option that remains with you (besides resigning or quitting) is maintaining a good relationship with your boss. Understand the ailments of such a Stone-age boss – try to cure the disease without hating the patient. It is possible. In a subtle manner give your knowledge to him without belittling him. Many of them know their weakness; they want to learn. But they are shy-learners! </em></P>
<P>*** </P>
<P><em>If you think your boss is stupid, remember : You wouldn’t have a job if he was any smarter. </em></P>

<H2>2. Busy Bosses </H2>
<P>I had a colleague, Bhaskar Raju (not his real name). He was heading the Personnel Department in another factory of my company. His people used to share many stories about him. One such story is quite relevant to the topic. It appears that he used to come to office late - just after lunch - not sometimes but most of the time. He would relax and read newspapers and magazines. His day would start after the evening tea was served. Then, he would call his staff to his room, one-by-one, and judge their progress. The last guy’s turn would come sometime late in the evening. When they were completely exhausted they were loaded with new work. Each new task was labelled ‘Priority task’. </P>
<P>His lady secretary would leave the office at 5.30 pm as she had to board the company’s bus. But his male secretary had to sweat it out until the boss left the office. After 8 pm he would start calling his corporate bosses disturbing them at their residence. Since the call was given by the secretary, Raju did not have to state that he was speaking from the office. One thing which he would never forget to mention to his bosses was, “Sir, I am dying with the workload.” It was no wonder that in the corporate office he earned the nickname ‘Busy Raju’. This I came to know when my Director Personnel asked me, “How is Mr Busy Raju, your counterpart in the Bearings factory?” In a subtle manner he made it clear that people sitting in the Ivory Towers cannot be deceived by such third rate tricks. I never shared this comment with Raju and he continued with his buffoonery thinking himself to be a smart guy. </P>
<P>“Don’t you see, I am busy?” is the favourite sentence of Mr </P>
<P>Busy Boss. They feel happy so long as they are seen to be busy by people. They feel glad when someone will tell them, “Sir, take care of your health – work is not everything!” </P>
<P>‘I am OK so long as I am busy’ is the psyche of Busy bosses. They, somehow, like to be seen to be very busy. Their secretaries understand their psyche. Whenever anybody wants to meet him, the secretary will say, “Boss is very busy. He is in meeting.” She, however, is fully aware that her boss is actually chit-chatting over coffee with some officers as a pastime! </P>
<P>There are four kinds of ‘Busy Bosses’ </P>
<ol>
<LI>Procrastinator busy bosses </LI>
<LI>Disengaging busy bosses </LI>
<LI>Distracting busy bosses </LI>
<LI>Purposeful busy bosses Let me briefly explain what I mean by these sub-titles. </LI>
</ol>
<P><SPAN>1. Procrastinator busy bosses: These guys are those who have already spent their energy and lost focus. It is believed that 30% of corporate bosses in Industry as well as in Bureaucracy are busy procrastinators. They delay the process and do not take timely decisions because they lack both <em>energy</em> and <em>focus</em>. Yet they will keep busy by writing comments on the file ‘Please discuss’, ‘Take it up in the next meeting’, ‘Please speak up’, ‘Can we defer it for sometime and wait and see?’ Why do they behave in that manner? In most of the cases they feel ‘insecure’ and suffer from ‘fear of the future’ – what will happen if I commit a mistake! From where does this fear come? It comes from the level of their impotence. It is also possible that at some </SPAN>point in their lives they were punished or suffered negative consequences when they took an initiative. I would like to share one very important point. Procrastination does not wholly depend on one’s personality; it can be influenced by organizational behaviour. </P>
<ol>
<LI>Disengaged Busy Bosses: As per some studies, around 20% busy bosses fall in this category. The problem with these bosses is though they are quite focussed they have low levels of energy – no fire in the belly. So, though they want to perform they remain disengaged most of the time owing to their low energy levels. They have clear goals but pursue them half-heartedly. Their mind-set can be explained in terms of what is known as ‘defensive avoidance’. They understand the need yet do not take the initiative. Purposely they delay taking decisions and invest little energy in making the right ‘cut’. Again, for such type of behaviour the person alone is not responsible; organizational behaviour is equally responsible in creating such disengaged bosses. When their creative initiatives were not appreciated by the organization, they became withdrawn. Then they had energy but they did not get support; now they do not have energy and management expects some creative initiative from them! Once people, especially senior people, sulk it is difficult to enthuse them. To overcome their deficiency, they pretend to be busy. </LI>
<LI>Distracted busy bosses: Into this quadrant fall many – around 40% - of busy bosses. They have the energy but lack focus. They are bubbling with energy but do not know how to discharge it. So, they behave like the ‘unguarded missiles’. They desperately need to do ‘something’ but they do not know what is that ‘something’ </LI>
</ol>
<P>they want to do. With lot of energy and no sense of direction, they behave proverbially like a ‘bull in a China shop’. These bosses tend to be short-sighted and often overcommitted. Again, the fault is not always with such bosses; in many cases they become the victim of bad organizational behaviour. When they were occupying junior positions, they were bubbling with enthusiasm but their seniors never guided them. So they turned into some sort of ‘unguarded missile’. Since they have to keep themselves busy to discharge their high levels of energy, they go on hitting out in this direction or that direction like a beetle which goes on hitting into the walls in an attempt to find a way out and starts ‘bleeding’. </P>
<P>4. Purposeful Busy Bosses: They are the smallest in number </P>
<P>– around 10% of busy bosses. The prime reason of their effectiveness is that they very focussed and highly energetic. They have fire in their belly as well as clear vision in the mind – they know where they want to go, how they want to go. They are absolutely clear about their objectives, goals and vision. They set their time-frame and try to accomplish their defined goals within the stipulated time-frame. They have ‘clarity of goals’ and ‘exploding energy’. They are self-aware and self-inspired bosses. They have two positive forces – clarity of direction and zealous energy. They think, reflect, plan, move and achieve. </P>
<P>There is a popular saying, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to go to the forest to gather wood, saw it and nail the planks together. Just create the <em>passion</em> for the sea – challenge and choice.” </P>
<P>A few tips </P>
<P>If they are busy bosses, they will remain busy come what may. You can manage such bosses by complementing their deficiencies. Let me explain this for each type of Busy Boss : </P>
<ol>
<LI>Your <em>Procrastinator Busy Bosses</em> lack both energy and direction, yet they love to be busy. It is a golden opportunity for the subordinate managers to use their own vision and energy; what is needed is the bosses support and confidence. You should not try to grab the credit – let them get the credit and then you will see they give you full support. </LI>
<LI>Your <em>Disengaged Busy Bosses</em> have clarity of vision but they have already spent their energy. Seek guidance from them and give them support through your exploding energy. He has the eyes, you can become his limbs and then you will see the miracle. </LI>
<LI>Your <em>Distracted Busy Bosses</em> have a reservoir of unspent energy but they do not know in which direction they should get it exploded. You become their eyes and show them the right direction. </LI>
<LI>Your <em>Purposeful Busy Bosses</em> are capable stalwarts- who have energy as well has the vision. Take full advantage of their strengths and seek guidance. You will find them very supportive. </LI>
</ol>
<P>Remember, many busy bosses have four expectations from their subordinates: </P>
<dl>
<DT>(1) </DT>
<DD>They are ‘detail oriented’ and want everything in detail. Brevity is not their cup of tea. </DD>
<DT>(2)</DT>
<DD> Mostly they are ‘hands-on’ sort of people. They want to know what is happening in the organization. </DD>
<DT>(3) </DT>
<DD>They will not accept the fact that their subordinates know more than them. They like ‘low profile’ people. </DD>
</dl>
<P>(4) They pretend they are short of time. So they expect their people to constantly display not only through words but also through their body language – <em>Madam, I know you are busy; let me take just two more precious minutes from you. </em></P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> Choose a task your boss does not do </em></P>
<P><em>well or like to do. You will be relieving your boss of the </em></P>
<P><em>burden rather than seeming to invade his or her turf. </em></P>
<P>*** </P>
<P><em>It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especiall</em><em>y </em><em>when you celebrate victory when nice things occur</em><em>. </em><em>You take the front line when there is danger. Then peopl</em><em>e </em><em>will appreciate your leadership</em><em>. </em></P>

<H2>3. Paranoid Bosses </H2>
<P>It was a cold, blood-clotting winter evening when I landed at the Srinagar airport in the month of January. I had visited this beautiful valley many times and ‘biting cold’ was not a new experience for me. But this time I felt as if the cold breeze was piercing into my flesh, touching the bones. Had it been my choice, I would have avoided visiting this ‘Heaven-on-Earth’ valley during peak winter. But I was summoned for an emergency -to investigate a grave misconduct case involving a financial deal. </P>
<P>As per protocol, I met Urs, the General Manager of Srinagar Watch Factory. He welcomed me without giving me a smile. When I shook hands with him I found no warmth in it. His secretary was courteous enough to serve hot tea (he did not even make a request for it). While his secretary was serving tea I broached the topic – the purpose of my visit. But he signalled me not to begin the discussion. When his secretary went out, he gave a deep sigh and said , “Now you can talk.” I understood what was on his mind. He did not want anyone else to hear our conversation. He briefed me about the case and then told me that he would invite the CVO – Chief Vigilance Officer – to share more details as well as show me the relevant documents. </P>
<P>Kampasi, the CVO, was perhaps waiting outside for getting the ‘GM’s Summon’. He and the GM’s secretary entered the room holding the pile of files. Urs asked his secretary to put on the ‘red lamp’ and instructed him not to allow anyone to enter his room. The CVO explained the entire case to me and showed me the relevant evidence which he had collected in support of the case. He </P>
<P>had done a meticulous task making my job easy. After the CVO left the room, the General Manager asked me my views. I explained that there was a good <em>prima facie</em> case for initiating disciplinary proceedings against two managers who were involved in the corrupt financial deal. The General Manager did not seem to be satisfied with my answer. He then confided to me that I should not trust the CVO and that I should carry out my investigations independently. </P>
<P>“You know, these Kashmiris are always goody-goody with each other – you should not trust them. Though he has dealt with the case nicely and brought lots of information to the surface, yet we do not know if he may be hiding many facts or may be giving wrong information to make the case weak. You cannot trust them!” I thanked him for his advice and suggested that I would seek assistance from my HR colleague at the Srinagar unit. Urs virtually jumped from his chair, “You mean Bhargava?” I nodded my head in affirmation. </P>
<P>“Never do such a mistake – he is the most untrustworthy guy. I have my own suspicions about him.” Then he enquired suspiciously, “Have you already discussed this case with him?” I smiled and said, “No – not yet .” </P>
<P>“No, don’t even let him know the purpose of your visit. Though he is not a Kashmiri, yet I cannot trust him. I have my own suspicions about him. You can tell him that you have visited this factory to solve some Industrial Relation issues.” I nodded my head as I had no other option. He was suggesting to me to tell a lie to Bhargava who knew all about the Industrial Relation issues of Srinagar. How could have I told him that I had come there to solve an IR issue! Urs’ suggestion was something like suggesting to a pregnant lady to tell a lie to the mid-wife that she has not yet conceived. </P>
<P>“Then, can I take the assistance of the Finance chief?” I asked. “Since this case relates to financial irregularities, he will be the right person to assist me.” </P>
<P>“You mean Razdan — the Kashmiri Pandit!” he asked. </P>
<P>“Yes,” I replied, coolly. “He is a nice gentleman. I know him from the time he was in the corporate office.” </P>
<P>“You know him?” he asked nervously. “Have you already shared this case with him?” He asked this question as if he was convinced that I had already shared some information with Razdan. Despite my telling him that I had not discussed this issue with anyone, he remained suspicious. He asked another question in a probing tone. </P>
<P>“Who came to the airport to receive you?” </P>
<P>“Abdul Rabb.” </P>
<P>“You mean the Rabb of HR Department?” </P>
<P>“Yes.” </P>
<P>“Oh my God! He is a mischief monger. He must have already spread the news in the factory about the purpose of your visit. He is a very cunning guy.” </P>
<P>“But I have not revealed anything to him though he kept asking me what made me visit this unit so suddenly.” </P>
<P>“He asked so!” exclaimed the GM, in a very serious tone. “I don’t know why Bhargava chose Rabb to receive you at the airport. They all are one.” </P>
<P>“Why are you so apprehensive about Kashmiris?” Somehow I could not resist asking him this delicate question. However, he did not mind my query. He paused for a minute. “Because, it is ‘they’ versus ‘me’!” he replied. </P>
<P>“I couldn’t get you!” I said. Though I had understood the hint that he had given to me indirectly, yet I waited to hear more from him. </P>
<P>“You know I am from South India – I am not one among </P>
<P>them. They all are one.” </P>
<P>“But Bhargava is a Rajasthani!” was my prompt reply. </P>
<P>“He is most untrustworthy,” he interrupted. “I can trust the local fellows but not Bhargava.” </P>
<P>“And Rabb, I mean Abdul Rabb…” </P>
<P>“Mr. Siddiqui, you do not know your own HR guys. He is from Ajmer, the same State. He is a real rogue, the right-hand of Bhargava… In a way, I may trust Bhargava sometime but not Abdul Rabb. You cannot understand them.” </P>
<P>We went on talking for an hour with the red bulb on and the GM’s visitors waiting for him in the adjacent room. Any name I suggested to him, he had some issue with that guy. I felt like telling him to arrange my return ticket by the evening flight. Sometimes I got the feeling that he was even suspecting my credibility! I left his room without any clue or guidance. During my one-hour discussion with him I learnt that except for him everyone else was a rogue, cheat and trouble monger! </P>
<P>I decided to take charge of the situation and started my investigations in a manner that I felt was right. The General Manager was not happy. Rather he was annoyed with me. Later when I reached Bangalore, my Director (HR) shared with me that Urs had made some discrete enquiries about me – he had a suspicion that I, being a Muslim, might be in cahoots with them. “He even blamed me for choosing you, a Muslim, for conducting investigations in Srinagar,” he said with a smile, as he shared this information with me openly. I narrated the entire story to my Director. He heard me out patiently. </P>
<P>“I am not surprised,” said my Director. “Urs is known for his suspicious mind. You know, his wife, who is a doctor, has left him as he used to suspect her.” He shared this secret that was not known </P>
<P>to me. “But, you know, he is the most honest person. The real problem with him is that he considers everyone else dishonest and suspects everyone’s integrity.” </P>
<P>“Sir, to my mind, he is suffering from a mental disease – paranoia,” I replied hesitantly, as I shared my own ‘suspicions’ with my boss. </P>
<P>“His nick name is Mr. Paranoid!” laughed my boss . “Do you know, who gave this wonderful title to him?” After a significant pause he said, “Our Chairman. In the inner circle of Directors we all call him Mr. Paranoid.” </P>
<P>Later I collected more information about Mr. Paranoid. It appears that once he was in-charge of the Hyderabad factory. As a ‘forced bachelor’ he used to stay in one of the rooms of the company’s guesthouse. Hyderabad is known for ‘power-cuts’; electricity supply is a perennial issue. The city faces many planned shutdowns and unplanned power disruptions. It appears Urs considered such power disruptions as a part of the conspiracy by his Manager (Electrical) in connivance with the local electricity authorities. </P>
<P>Most of the Paranoid bosses suffer from the mental ailment – paranoia. Some suffer from a minor mental ailment, medically known as ‘anxiety neurosis’. In both cases, the trigger point is a ‘negative attitude’- what is known in behavioural science as NMA (Negative Mental Attitude). For this reason, CEOs must take extra care to ensure that their managers receive inputs for ‘building positive attitudes’. </P>
<P>There are some bosses who consider ‘appreciation’ to be a great sin. You do anything – even play a miracle by making an impossible thing possible – they will not utter a single word of ‘appreciation’, let alone pat the back or give a passionate hug (<em>jaddu ki jappi</em>) </P>
<P>In my workshops on ‘Building a Positive attitude’, I very </P>
<P>fondly narrate the following story which I had read in some book: </P>
<P>There was once a hunter who bought a bird dog, the only one of its kind in the world – it could walk on water. He was very pleased that he could show off his new acquisition to his friends. </P>
<P>He invited a friend to go duck hunting. After some time, they shot a few ducks and the man ordered his dog to run and fetch the birds. All day long, the dog ran on water and kept fetching the birds. </P>
<P>The owner was expecting a comment or a compliment about this amazing dog but did not get one. As they were returning home, he asked his friend if he had noticed anything unusual about his dog. The friend replied, “Yes, in fact I did notice something unusual. Your dog cannot swim.” </P>
<P>Pessimism is the sign of NMA – Negative Mental Attitude. The pessimists always see the glass ‘half empty’. In acute cases, pessimists turn paranoid. To add fun to my sessions, I explain some funny characteristics of pessimists. </P>
<P>Pessimists: </P>
<ol>
<LI>Are unhappy when they have no troubles to speak of </LI>
<LI>Feel bad when they feel good </LI>
<LI>Spend most of their life at the complaint-counter </LI>
<LI>Always turn out the lights to see, ‘How dark it is?’ </LI>
<LI>Cannot enjoy their health because they think they may be sick tomorrow </LI>
<LI>Not only expect the worst but make the worst of whatever happens </LI>
<LI>Do not see the doughnut, only see the hole </LI>
<LI>Believe that the sun shines only to cast shadows </LI>
<LI>Forget their blessings and count their troubles </LI>
</ol>
<P>The initial symptom of paranoia is the ‘pessimistic outlook’. The famous Indian actress – the Tragedy Queen – suffered this syndrome. Yes, you guessed right – it was Meena Kumari. The other actress, Parveen Babi, too was a case of acute paranoia and died a Paranoid. </P>
<P>Urs is not a solitary case; there are many Mr. Paranoids in the real Corporate World. Is paranoia a negative characteristic of Leadership? Whereas many will say, ‘Yes’, yet some will not agree. One such business practitioner is Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, who became popular with his book ‘Only the Paranoid Survive’. He is perhaps the first author who considers ‘Paranoia’ as a positive trait of leadership. There are many admirers of this book. “One of my all-time favourite business books, and a huge influence on my leadership philosophy is Andy Grove’s ‘Only Paranoids Survive’,” wrote Regis Hadiaris in his book ‘Personal Development’.</P>
<P> ‘Only the Paranoids Survive’ is no doubt a wonderful book except for the title. Andy Grove has used the word ‘Paranoid’ as a positive connotation, which many have mistakenly accepted by taking the word at its surface value. In this book, Grove discusses <em>strategic inflection points</em>, ‘How leaders must identify them, and lead their teams through them!’ </P>
<P>What is a ‘Strategic Inflection Point?’ Grove defines a strategic inflection point as a time in the life of a business or project when its fundamentals are changing significantly. “Often, ‘Point’ is really a misnomer, and it is actually a long, sometimes painful, period of change” believes Grove. In his view the ‘strategic inflection points’ are those times and decisions that make or break your business, your project, your client relationship, your Executive’s view of you etc.,” holds Andy Grove. One could look at Strategic Inflection Points as ‘Tipping Points’ as well. To my mind, Grove seems to </P>
<P>have got influenced by Gladwell’s popular book ‘The Tipping </P>
<P>Point’. </P>
<P>In the book ‘Only Paranoids Survive’, a ‘Paranoid Leader’ is one who: </P>
<ul>
<LI>Constantly tries to anticipate change. Only those who constantly anticipate change will survive when change happens. </LI>
<LI>Seeks the opinion of all those around him as they are usually in touch with impending changes sooner than he is. </LI>
<LI>Encourages debates at all costs. The most important tool in identifying a strategic inflection point is broad and intensive debate. </LI>
<LI>Does not justify holding back because he does not know the answer – seeks them out as fast as he can. </LI>
<LI>Gives his most considered opinion, clearly and forcefully. </LI>
</ul>
<P>One can see how much positivity is infused in the negative word ‘Paranoid’. Andy Grove’s ‘Paranoid’ is a proactive, consultative, and an alert leader. If someone does not understand the contextual meaning of ‘paranoid’ and takes this word literally, one can get misled or mislead others. </P>
<P>To be vigilant and proactive to survive in today’s fast changing business scenario, business leaders should self-introspect by asking themselves the following two vital questions: </P>
<ul>
<LI>Am I actively seeking opinions from everyone possible, regardless of their hierarchal status or title? </LI>
<LI>Is our key competitor about to change? If yes, what are our business plans and strategies to gain the cutting-edge? </LI>
</ul>
<P>The issue is not that the business leaders do not see the right direction the business world is heading to; the issue is that usually we act too late and too little. Business often fails because our business strategies are not supportive to ‘customer retention’ – either we leave them or they leave us. As per Andy Grove’s approach, lack of such understanding or lapses occur because people do not work like a Paranoid boss. Andy Grove’s ‘Paranoid’ is not the one who is highly suspicious. His Paranoid is the most successful entrepreneur who can alone survive and thrive in today’s world. </P>
<P>If such smart proactive business leaders are called ‘Paranoids’, what title is left for those who are real paranoids? </P>
<P>‘To be vigilant’ and ‘to be paranoid’ are not one and the same thing. On this point I totally disagree with Grove. Trusting everyone and trusting no one – both are bad. Rather mistrust is more dangerous than trusting everyone. Abraham Lincoln is right when he warns, “Believing everybody is dangerous; believing nobody is very dangerous.” </P>
<P>As a business leader, we should not forget that each one of us is an ‘inter-being’- this means we cannot survive without the help and assistance of another person. Relationships are important in life as well as in corporate life. Relationships are built on trust, not on mistrust. How can you make your people trustworthy? ‘Just by trusting them’ is the only right answer. </P>
<P>Like the hero of this chapter – Urs – there are many ‘misleaders’ who bring down the morale of people and tarnish the organisational culture of excellence just by creating frustration to satisfy their suspicious mind. </P>
<P>“You cannot have success without Trust” – etch this saying in stone, if you can. “Building trust is the critical success factor of management, yet it is non-existence in today’s world!” observes Professor Richard D Aven of Dartmouth Business School. And Tom Peters emphasises this point by saying, “Technique and Technology are important, but adding Trust is the issue of the decade.” </P>
<P>A Paranoid boss suffers from insecurity. He is highly suspicious </P>
<P>in nature and he always carries a feeling that ‘some of his enemies are out to get him’. His door is always locked. The subordinates can deal with him through slips or his private secretary. Silence mystifies. </P>
<P>The Paranoid bosses must understand that leadership is all about trust and faith. If you do not trust your people, ‘Why would anyone follow you for the uphill tasks, giving their best, sometimes even risking lives?’ asks Collin Powell, the former Deputy Secretary in Bush’s government, who was basically a great military guy. He resigned when he noticed his bleeding conscience. </P>
<P>I offer the following tips for the Paranoid bosses who work on mistrust: </P>
<ul>
<LI><em>Be aware of ‘Bad execution of good Intent’</em> – A bad execution of good intent always gives you bad results. Not only the ends but also the means should be good. Good means for good ends should be your objective. Dealing with mistrust is a negative approach. Mistrust will always result in mistrust. </LI>
<LI><em>Examine and Refine your Motives </em>– your motives, good or bad, are the product of your thoughts. Your thoughts can also be influenced by your motives. Both work upon each other. It has a snow-bowling effect. When dealing with people on the basis of trust we should examine and refine our motives, not only sometimes but always. </LI>
<LI><em>Declare your intent — keep no hidden agendas. </em>Be open, be transparent. Transparency works; it plays miracles. One of the secrets of my success is my transparency. I always tell my people that life is not a game of chess where we have to plan secret strategic moves for winning the game. When I talk about transparency one must not </LI>
</ul>
<P>misunderstand and demonstrate it by removing the curtains of one’s bedroom. </P>
<ul>
<ul>
<LI><em>Choose Abundance</em> — “The measure of your life will not be in what you accumulate, but what you give away,” writes Dr. Wayne Dyer in his book ‘The Power of Intentions’. What you give comes back to you. If you trust, people will trust you; if you mistrust, people will mistrust you. Life is like a mountain’s echo – what you shout you hear! </LI>
<LI>• <em>Keep focus on ‘Solutions’ and helping others — Be positive! </em>Remember, every problem comes with a gift. See that gift first. Negative people, on the contrary, see a problem in every gift. You get what you focus on. If you keep focus on problems you will get them in abundance. If you keep focus on solutions you will get them in abundance. </LI>
</ul>
<LI><em>Your behaviour demonstrates your intent.</em> So, watch your behaviour so that it does not send out misleading signals. And on the other side, do not judge someone wrongly due to his ‘outward’ behaviour. </LI>
<LI><em>Never ever compromise on the actions which may dishonour your credibility. </em>To protect your credibility, ponder upon these questions: </LI>
<LI>What kind of results am I currently producing? </LI>
<LI>Do those results increase or diminish my personal credibility? </LI>
<LI>If hiring, to what extent would that person’s track record and current performance influence my decision? </LI>
<LI>How good is my own track record? </LI>
<LI>How good am I at identifying desired results and in executing plans effectively to accomplish those results? </LI>
<LI>Does my performance inspire confidence and trust in others? </LI>
</ul>
<P>Self-introspect – are you too suspicious OR are you too gullible? Both are two extreme ends of the normal bell curve, each occupying 20% portion. You should discard both these extreme ends and keep focus on the middle part of the curve, the 60% part of the popular Bell Curve. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> It is equally an error to trust all men or no man. Create a perfect balance between Trust and Gullibility – the two extremes of Smart Trust! Look for and go for: </em></P>
<P><em>In a large organization, the nice guy gets ahead because </em></P>
<P><em>he or she is socially pleasant and agreeable. The nice guy follow</em><em>s </em><em>directions and takes order well and doesn’t make waves</em><em>… </em><em>When the entire organization becomes top-heavy wit</em><em>h </em><em>‘nice guys’, however, organizational disaster ca</em><em>n </em><em>unexpectedly occur</em><em>. </em></P>

<H2>4. Chocolate-cream Bosses </H2>
<P>“When are you planning to go to Singapore?” Raj (not his real name), my boss, asked me. </P>
<P>“Next week,” was my simple reply. </P>
<P>“You are going with your family, right?” he asked. </P>
<P>“Yes.” I chose to be brief again. </P>
<P>“I understand your son stays there,” he shot back. </P>
<P>“Yes.” </P>
<P>My mind was still agitating over what had happened a couple of hours back in the factory. My boss and I had been sent by the Chairman to this factory in Hyderabad on a special mission. We were supposed to share with the employees and their union office bearers the hard fact that the board had decided to close down the factory. Though my boss minced his words, I made the corporate message loud and clear to them. In the same breath I also conveyed to them the management’s decision that they would be provided alternative jobs in other factories provided they were willing to move to other locations. The union was not very happy and threatened to strike. They also made clear that some employees would go for, what they called, a ‘fast unto death’ if the corporate management did not withdraw the decision. The meeting was prorogued to meet again the next day. We were ‘allowed’ by the union to rethink and convey the management’s final decision. We returned to the hotel. </P>
<P>Sitting at the pool’s site, we were trying to relax by sipping </P>
<P>hot South Indian coffee, when my boss all of a sudden enquired about my leave plans for visiting my son in Singapore. </P>
<P>“Next week?” Raj repeated, in utter astonishment. “I don’t think you can go now.” </P>
<P>“Why?” I asked. “My leave has already been sanctioned last week.” </P>
<P>“Last week,” he repeated, accentuating the word ‘last’. After a brief pause he shared his thoughts. “Now that the union has threatened to go in for direct action, I don’t think the Chairman will allow you to go on a holiday.” </P>
<P>“No problem,” I coolly replied. “If the union goes on strike, I will postpone my holiday.” </P>
<P>“Oh! That’s not good,” said Raj, sympathetically. Perhaps he was not ready for this sort of answer. “No, you should never do that.” </P>
<P>“I don’t think I have any other option if the union starts an IR stir.” </P>
<P>“If… a great ‘If’,” he laughed. I still could not understand what he was trying to convey to me through his zigzag talk with the markings of a Chinese puzzle. </P>
<P>“Why do you say so?” I asked my boss. “Have you any doubt? Do you feel the union is not serious about all that they said in the meeting?” Before I could raise my third question he stopped me by saying, “No, no, I don’t mean all that…” </P>
<P>“Then?” </P>
<P>“Listen,” he said, in a low tone. The pause was long this time. He was weighing his words before saying the next word. Then he simply smiled. He smiled a mysterious smile. “No point,” he murmured. “You will not understand…” </P>
<P>I chose not to ask. He smiled again. The smile was no longer enigmatic; it was miserable this time. “No point,” he mumbled again. I felt a wave of relief thinking the talk was over. I was wrong. In fact the talk had not even begun. Raj was carefully reading my face searching for the matching words. Then, he pulled his bamboo chair near to me and made his final statement without any ambiguity. </P>
<P>“Moid, listen to me carefully,” he whispered again. “If union goes in for direct action, neither can you go to Singapore nor can I retire peacefully. You know, after two month I am retiring. I have lived my life in peace. At the fag end of my career I would not like to buy trouble. I want to retire in peace. I also wish you should go with your family and enjoy a holiday with your son and his family in Singapore. Don’t decide in haste. Why should you or I take the brunt for the harsh decision taken by the board sitting in the Ivory Tower? I suggest you talk to the Chairman. He listens to your suggestions. Say the situation is turning violent and if we don’t withdraw the decision there will be bloodshed in the factory. Ask him to defer the decision till the next board meeting. And let us give assurance to the union at tomorrow’s meeting that no wrong will be caused to this factory; let them cool down.” </P>
<P>I did not react. Rather I did not know how to react! Unperturbed by my facial expressions he went on to make the last kill. “Let us buy peace at any cost so that you can enjoy your holidays and I can make my retirement peaceful. Let the Chairman and board face the music if they don’t review the decision in the next board meeting in the union’s favour.” </P>
<P>I kept mum for a while then smiled. Raj, my boss, heaved a sigh of relief taking my smile as my consent to what he had suggested to me little understanding what really caused me to smile. </P>
<P>“Stupid!” I said to myself in my heart. What else could I have expected from Raj – a Chocolate-cream boss – who could never take a hard posture? At crossroads, Raj always used to choose the safest path. </P>
<P>What happened later is not relevant; how Raj behaved when his personal peace was threatened is the issue. </P>
<P>I adopted the term ‘Chocolate-cream boss’ from the military. In the military, the term ‘Chocolate-cream soldier’ is often used for a soldier who has never been seen in action on the battleground. In industries, many Chocolate-cream managers rise in the hierarchy without even understanding the basics of management rationale or facing the ground realities of setting up a new unit, developing an industrial complex, working in a manufacturing unit, turning around a sick company or facing ticklish situations that need guts and competence to tackle. Yet they grow to the heights of incompetence perhaps only to prove Peter Drusker's Principle. They grow by creating work suitable for such Chocolate-cream positions, reposing full faith in Parkinson’s Law. They grow superseding even the high-fliers, wearing the mask of a nice guy to confirm the truth of Gareth Gardiner’s thoughts – “In a large organization, the nice guy gets ahead because he or she is socially pleasant and agreeable. The nice guy follows directions and takes order well and doesn’t make waves… When the entire organization becomes top-heavy with ‘nice guys’, however, organizational disaster can unexpectedly occur.” </P>
<P>This title of ‘Chocolate-cream’ is also used for nice guys. A nice guy knows that it is not the weathercock but the wind that changes its direction. He, therefore, takes care of the wind. He is watchful of organizational politics and tends to adjust himself to any circumstance. He is not too sure of his own strength. He always avoids confrontation for he himself lives in a glasshouse. He spends his energy on image building without realizing that one is never perceived by the other as per one’s projection. He is perceived as what he appears to them. He toils hard to gain self-mileage and growth in hierarchy. “He works hard enough and well enough at his job that he rises up the organization,” believes Gareth Gardiner. </P>
<P>The cardinal objective of such Chocolate-cream bosses is to create a good image. They will not do anything by which their good image is affected. These guys can never say ‘No’ to anyone. </P>
<P>Raj was such nice guy; he would never take any risk nor would he do anything by which his ‘nice-guy’ image got adversely affected. Later, luckily the same Raj became Director HR – my immediate boss. One strange characteristic of his personality was that <em>he would never say, “No!” </em>If he did not like a suggestion or idea or proposal, he would not say ‘No!’ but meticulously ensure that such a thing never happened. You could ask him a hundred times yet he would never disagree but also never do it. His subordinates understood that he would not allow a thing to be done in spite of not saying ‘No’ for it. </P>
<P>Such Chocolate-cream bosses believe saying ‘No’ is unethical – saying ‘No’ will cause ‘losing face’. I do not think one should be so touchy about such things. When it comes to a crunch situation, one must dare to say ‘No’. A honest ‘No’ is better than a dishonest ‘Yes’. I can quote many such incidents where saying a dishonest ‘Yes’ caused unmanageable situations. Let me quote one more incident about Mr. Raj, my Chocolate-cream boss. </P>
<P>Ms. Maya Devi (not her real name) was recruited as Deputy General Manager, Public Relations, in a public sector company. She became my colleague as she was reporting to a common boss, Director HR. She was excellent at her work. She did not take much time to create a good place for herself in just six months. Then something strange happened. The Vigilance Chief received an anonymous letter saying that Maya Devi was a cheat and that she had submitted false certificates of experience and professional qualifications. Vigilance enquiries revealed that she was simply an art graduate with no diploma in public relations and communication, and that all the experience certificates produced by her at the time of appointment were false. Obviously, hers was a strong case for disciplinary action and therefore, she had to be issued a charge-sheet. </P>
<P>My boss Raj (Director HR), as mentioned earlier, was a ‘nice guy’ type of personality. He never wanted any trouble or tension. So he asked me to transfer Maya to the Chairman’s office to avoid signing a charge-sheet and initiating a disciplinary case against her. In many organizations, the PR Chief directly reports to the CEO of the company so it was not an issue for me to transfer her. My real anxiety was about the ‘disciplinary authority’. If she were transferred with reporting authority to the Chairman, the disciplinary authority would also shift from the Director (HR) to the Chairman. In the event of her eventual termination (under the authority of the Chairman), the appellate authority will shift to the level of the Board. The Board would first ask how she was recruited with such forged certificates and would fix responsibility on the Director HR for such gross negligence. I shared these apprehensions with Raj, my Director, and he immediately understood that he would land into trouble by transferring her to the Chairman’s office. So, she remained with the HR Directorate and eventually a domestic enquiry was initiated against her under the authority of Director HR – the ‘nice guy syndrome’ boss. He felt bad for performing such an ‘unholy task’. </P>
<P>It was my bad luck that my boss chose me to be the Enquiry Officer. I had little option but to conduct the disciplinary enquiry against my own colleague. The case was very simple and Vigilance had all legal evidence against her. Yet, as per government rules, such formality was essential. During the enquiry, on many occasions, Maya Devi asked for my support saying that she had full confidence that I would shield her and declare her not guilty of charges. But I always used to say, “Maya, if you are proved innocent, no one can harm you but if you are proved guilty, no one can protect you.” Yet she was hoping against hope that I would protect her. Unfortunately, she was proven guilty as per the evidence on record and I had no option than to write the findings accordingly. </P>
<P>The day came when it was decided to dismiss her from service. I prepared the dismissal order and went to my boss’s chamber to obtain his signature. He signed the dismissal order with a heavy heart and feeling of guilt. I collected the signed dismissal order and kept it in the folder. Before I could leave, Maya entered the room. My boss welcomed her with a nervous smile. “Sir, there are some rumours in the office that today I will be terminated,” she asked point-blank, looking directly into his eyes (neglecting me completely as if I was not there). I could not believe my ears when I heard my boss say loudly, “Maya don’t believe in rumours. So long as I am there in this seat of authority no one can ever touch you.” I secretly peeped through the papers; yes, her dismissal order was already signed by him! I thought it was the right time to make my exit but my Director told me to go after having a cup of coffee with Maya. In a way he celebrated his promise to Maya that ‘no one can harm her’. Obviously, Maya was quite jubilant over his assurance. After finishing my cup of coffee I left. I was surprised that my boss did not say anything to me. After coming back to my room, I waited for an hour or so thinking that my boss would call me and give me some fresh instructions for not issuing the dismissal orders to her. But nothing strange happened! So, after waiting for another hour, I sent my junior to go and serve the dismissal order to her by taking the help of security. Later, my junior reported that she took those orders calmly and signed the acknowledgment. My task was completed. </P>
<P>Maya came to meet me. She said, “Mr. Siddiqui, I know on the basis of your findings I have lost my job but believe me, I have no grudge against you – you were honest enough never to give me false hope or make any false promise to me. But I do not understand that guy who gave me such a big assurance of protection and the very next moment issued my dismissal orders under his own signature. I will not leave that guy alone.” Before I could say anything, she left. Later I heard that she had created a nasty scene in the Director’s chamber abusing him of using indecent language. </P>
<P>What happened? My honest ‘No’ was honoured by Maya but my boss had to pay a heavy price for his dishonest ‘Yes’. </P>
<P>Saying ‘No’ is an art and sometimes it becomes necessary to say it. Recognize that you have the right to say ‘No’ when it comes to commitment which you apprehend to fulfil. But never say ‘No’ bluntly. Saying ‘No’ is an art. There are many ways to say ‘No’. Instead of saying to someone, “I do not agree with you.” you can say, “I have a different view.” </P>
<P>The Chocolate-cream bosses are least assertive – they follow the famous Hindi phrase ‘<em>chalta hai’</em>’. ‘Don’t be assertive’ is the </P>
<P>first principle that a Chocolate-cream manager religiously follows. In a review discussion, while evaluating the performance of a high-flier, one such Chocolate-cream boss advised the high-flier not to be assertive. “You are a bit assertive – that’s the only negative trait I find in you,” said the boss. What he indirectly suggested was that the high-flier should not to make any waves in the organization. “Never try to hit the headlines in the organization – always be moderate” is another piece of advice that came to another high-flier. </P>
<P>Manual J Smith, in his best seller on assertive training ‘When I say No, I Feel Guilty’, unmasks such managers who treat assertiveness as a sin. “Our assertive rights are a basic framework for each individual’s healthy participation in any human relationship” is his strong belief. Asserting one’s views makes one think and I believe that being assertive means being confident of one’s self and in one’s abilities – “No matter what happens to me, I can cope with it.” </P>
<P>Managers must strive to develop assertive skills, boldness and fairness. Sobriety is the prerequisite for assertive skills and demonstration of courageous gestures. The phrase ‘Be fair and firm’ is no more valid unless it is suffixed with the word ‘friendly’. ‘Be fair, firm and friendly’ is the complete message. </P>
<P>A few tips </P>
<P>I offer a few tips to ‘Raj-type bosses’ on ‘how to get rid of the Chocolate-cream syndrome’: </P>
<P><SPAN>• <em>Never allow personal insecurities to blur your vision</em> – Personal insecurity prompts us to invent rules to control the behaviour of others. I recall that a decade ago, when we were formulating the Personnel Manual for one of </SPAN>the premier companies, my senior colleague got wild when I suggested making the rules simpler- avoiding legal jargon, provisions savings clauses etc. Later on, while sharing the secret of his success, he counselled me. “Never commit such a blunder,” he whispered. “If the personnel policies are made too simple, who will bother about you and me? Make them as complicated as possible if you want to be worshipped by the technocrats.” His message was quite clear – the more complicated the rules, the better your hold on others. Those who feel professionally insecure will single-handedly try to complicate matters by creating a Gordian knot here and there with an ulterior motive in mind. </P>
<ul>
<LI><em> Avoid offering justifications to buttress your actions</em> – When a child makes a mistake he immediately offers justification in support of his action. No such explanations are required in management affairs for the simple reason that they do not add any value to the product or customer. On the contrary, by demanding such justification from subordinates, quite often the boss will simply create ‘lame ducks’ in the organization. </LI>
<LI><em>Finding solutions to other people’s problems is your problem too</em>– On most occasions we withdraw ourselves on the alibi that ‘it is his (sub-ordinate’s) personal problem and I don’t want to invade on his private self ’. On the contrary, when it comes to pleasing someone, we do not hesitate in ‘yessing’ and agreeing to most of his thoughts and views, which our inner soul registers as ‘just stupid’. Turning a Nelson’s eye to the problems of your people is regressing to the Stone Age – never forget this. Resolve their problems to keep them healthy - physically, mentally and spiritually. When the soul suffers, the body </LI>
</ul>
<P>cannot be productive. By taking care of the soul of your </P>
<P>people, you can humanize the organization. </P>
<ul>
<LI><em>Be flexible</em> – Changing your mind is not being sinful. There is nothing like a perfect solution. Sometimes we are required to try this or that. Rigidity in approach would simply lead to a disaster. In life we face uncertainties – these can be faced and resolved only with flexibility and not with rigidity. There is nothing like the <em>Thakur ki zubaan</em> (the rigid spoken words of a <em>Thakur</em> which cannot be altered) for achieving success in our day-to-day life. It is better to try alternative solutions than to rigidly stick to a decision. You can then even better the best. </LI>
<LI><em>Making mistakes is a natural phenomenon of learning</em> – Those who do not make mistakes commit only blunders. </LI>
</ul>
<P>When a violent mob wanted to stone to death a sinner woman, Christ allowed them to do so on one ‘simple’ condition – <em>Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. </em></P>
<P>Each one of us makes mistakes. Making mistakes is natural. Shying away from this fact kills the learning instincts. </P>
<P>A Chocolate-cream boss is over cautious as he does not want to commit mistakes and suffer failures. “Men learn little from success, but much from failure,” is an Arabic saying. “He who has never failed somewhere, that man cannot be great,” believes Herman Melville. “In a day, when you don’t come across any problem, you can be sure that you are travelling in a wrong path,” says Swami Vivekananda. Albert Einstein’s thoughts are no different when he says, “If someone feels that he had never made a mistake in his life, then it means he had never tried a new thing in his life.” </P>
<P>A little girl, after a 30-minute struggle on the computer, got the print-out of a big banner for her uncle’s 60th birth anniversary <SPAN>with the spelling ‘Sixteeth’. When everyone started poking fun at her, she coolly and confidently replied, “So what? Mistakes do occur. What is there to laugh about!” Unknowingly she followed the basic principle of creativity: ‘It is better to fail in <em>originality </em>than to succeed in <em>aping’</em>. Creating a banner on the computer was more important than the mis-spelt word that could always be corrected. Such simple logic, so obvious to the little girl, is alien for Chocolate-cream bosses. </SPAN></P>
<P>It is always better to commit mistakes and say, “So what!” than to opt for inaction and apprehend, “What if?” </P>
<ul>
<ul>
<LI><em>Don’t be shy of saying, “I don’t know”</em> – At the International Resource Development Centre in UK, I asked a simple question to the specialist on Personnel Management who was taking a session on Leadership. “I am sorry – I don’t know,” was the simple answer that came from the specialist without any shred of hesitation. After a week I got a personal letter from her in which she clarified the point to my satisfaction. She also mentioned that she got the solution from one of her colleagues and was happy that my query had given her an opportunity to learn. </LI>
<LI>Not managers but ‘Heroic managers’ have a solution to every problem, which they pick out from their ‘fool’s cap’. </LI>
</ul>
<LI><em>It is better to be ‘admired’ than ‘liked’</em> – A Chocolate-cream boss will be loath to empower his people. He does not allow them to develop ‘assertive skills’ lest they use these against him sometime. </LI>
</ul>
<P>“Boldness in business is the first, second and third thing” is a precious adage which managers should never forget. </P>
<P>Sometimes a Chocolate-cream boss avoids taking a stand because he does not want to displease anyone. “I cannot <SPAN>give you the formula of success,” Herbert B Swope once said, while addressing a gathering. “But I can give a formula of failure which is – <em>try to please everyone</em>.” </SPAN></P>
<P>Joyce Engelson aptly says, “People get so damned frightened if someone threatens not to like them. They get paralyzed and don’t function to their own benefits… You will never be loved if you can’t risk being disliked.” </P>
<P>• <em>Solutions do not rest always in ‘logical’ decisions</em> – ‘<em>Fair is foul and foul is fair</em>’ wrote Shakespeare. What appears to be most logical can prove to be most stupid. </P>
<P>Once a problem was fed into a computer to decide and advise whether to buy a watch that runs late by one second in 24 hours or the one that did not ‘run’ at all! The computer preferred the latter. The logic was simple – the broken watch will show the correct time twice a day, whereas the one that runs late by one second will show the correct time only once in a million days. </P>
<P>“Not all logical statements are true, nor can our logical reasoning always predict what will happen in every situation… Logic and reasoning generally deal with ‘yes’s’ or ‘no’s’ , ‘black’ or ‘white’, process,” says Smith. “But such dichotomy-based logic doesn’t help much in dealing with the day-to-day situations.” </P>
<P>• <em>Don’t be shy of saying, “I don’t understand”</em> – “I do not understand my own actions,” wrote St. Paul once. </P>
<P>The real greatness lies in admitting, “I don’t understand” rather than going on to prove one’s self to be foolhardy by claiming you understand everything under the Sun and making a vulgar display of brute ignorance. Once, one such I-know-everything person enquired from a boy </P>
<P>– “Hey, is this camera for ‘colour photographs’ or ‘black and white’?” He refused to agree when the boy tried to educate him that it was not the camera but the film-roll which would get him the colour or black and white photographs. </P>
<P>True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life. </P>
<P>• <em>Say, “I don’t care at least once.”</em> – I recollect a story that was told to me during my primary school days. </P>
<P>Once, an old man and his son were riding on a little pony. When they were passing through a village people said, “Cruel fellows – no mercy for the poor animal!” Hearing this, the boy got down. They travelled to another village. The people here said, “Shameless old man – no mercy for the young boy who is walking.” </P>
<P>Hearing this, the old man got down and the boy sat on the pony. They reached another village. The people here said, “Shameless young fellow – no courtesy for his old father who is walking.” </P>
<P>Hearing this, the father and son decided not to ride the pony and walk. When they reached the next village, people said, “Foolish fellows. They have a pony, yet they are walking.” Hearing this, both of them got disgusted and lifted the little pony atop their heads. Now the people laughed and said, “See the mad fellows – they are carrying the pony with their hands.” </P>
<P>And only then did the old man and the boy say, “To Hell with you – we don’t care.” </P>
<P>Managers grossly mistake lack of assertiveness with sobriety. One of the fondest beliefs of a Chocolate-cream manager is that he can manage everything successfully by just being pleasant to his people. In this anxiety, he avoids situations that warrant hard or </P>
<P>even harsh decisions without even understanding the far-reaching </P>
<P>consequences of such avoidance. </P>
<P>A Chocolate-cream boss is simply paralyzed by his own neurotic fear. Gareth Gardiner, the author of <em>Tough-minded Management,</em> has made some valid observations. “The part of a nice person, that is a healthy and mature adult recognizes that he should take action, and take it now to cope with the poor performance of an employee; but the lingering childhood fear is so strong that it produces complete inaction. Such managerial dilemma creates a kind of organizational schizophrenia, delusion of grandeur, withdrawal, indecisiveness, uncertainty, misunderstanding, phantasm and suspicion everywhere.” </P>
<P>Once, a very senior <em>displease-not</em> boss offered very convincing logic for worshipping God. “Suppose God doesn’t exist, yet you don’t lose anything by worshipping Him. But if you don’t worship, and God really exists, then…! Isn’t it safer to worship without even knowing whether God exists or not?” More interesting was his logic for not attending the interview for the coveted position of CEO in the same company. “The chances of my selection may be fifty-fifty. But in the case of non-selection, the chances of antagonizing the incoming CEO are hundred per cent. He will never forget that I had contested against him. Then, why get into such a problematic situation where the chances of success are only fifty-fifty and those of getting into trouble cent per cent!” </P>
<P><SPAN>While passing through an industrial canteen, another <em>displease-not</em> manager soiled his white suit when an angry worker swung an egg-curry dish out of the window. Unable to control his anger, he shouted, “Who the hell dared to throw the egg-curry dish on me? Why are you hiding? Why don’t you come out and show me your dirty face?” He saw the hefty wrestler-like trade union leader approaching him in a menacing manner.The manager immediately wiped the egg-paste from his coat onto his fingertip and started </SPAN>licking it. “Wow – so tasty!” The manager looked at the union leader and asked, “I was only wondering why you didn’t like it. However, each one of us has a different taste … carry on.” Before the union leader could say anything, the manager hurriedly left the room! </P>
<P>Manuel J Smith describes this phenomenon nicely in simple words: <em>In certain situations, all of us feel like saying, “When I say ‘No’ I feel guilty, but if I say ‘Yes’ I’ll hate myself.” When you say this to yourself, your real desires are in conflict with your childhood training and you find yourself without cues that would prompt you in coping with this conflict. </em></P>
<P>In fact, not to say ‘No!’ is not at all the safe option the Chocolate-cream bosses believe it to be. I can quote any number of examples from my own experience where not saying ‘No!’ has caused an unmanageable IR situation. When one such <em>say-not-no</em> HR Chief, who went on saying ‘Yes’ to every request of the union, eventually failed to keep up to his ‘yesses’, he was virtually dragged from his cabin to the glass furnace. He was lucky that some loyal workers came and rescued him. </P>
<P>Another instance occurred some years ago when we decided to lay-off some employees due to heavy power-cuts. We had two factories at different locations as two different SBUs (Strategic Business Units) and each factory had its own recognized union. I was the Personnel Chief of one of the SBUs. We had held joint discussions and both SBUs had decided to go ahead with the layoff and not withdraw under any pressure unless the power-cuts were lifted by the Electricity Board. We were summoned by the State Minister for Labour. The dialogues with the unions started in his presence, and both the managements were represented by their Personnel Chiefs. I had preferred to say ‘No’ to withdrawing from the lay-off since I was sure that having decided to take the bull by the horns - there was no scope for juggling. I was stormed, ridiculed and branded as an anti-labour Personnel Manager. </P>
<P>Somehow my counterpart – the Personnel Chief of the other SBU </P>
<P>– decided not to earn the union’s wrath. He promised the Honourable Labour Minister of the State that he would reconsider the decision of the management and inform the union. Next day, as decided, both the factories went in for a lay-off. My operation was painless. But my counterpart in the other factory had to face hell for having made a false promise. He had no option than to call for the police force to maintain law and order. “Not saying ‘No’ was the most unpleasant experience of my life,” he eventually confessed. </P>
<P>Firing is another unholy task that Chocolate-cream bosses hate to do. They do not want any bloodstains on their ‘snow white’ image. To fire delinquent employees one requires assertive skills, guts and boldness. Only those who have learnt to lean towards dangers and uncomfortable situations can afford to do so. The Chocolate-cream bosses consider this a sin. They do not even make positive efforts to ‘counsel’ or ‘caution’ the employees who indulge in misconduct, unauthorized absenteeism or neglect of work. “Why displease someone and earn a bad image by cautioning or initiating disciplinary proceedings – let someone else do it” is the logic always maintained by these good guys. They search for a bad guy to perform such an unholy task, without their own involvement. </P>
<P>The HRD principle – <em>never resort to disciplinary action until all corrective measures are adopted first and various counselling techniques are exhausted</em> – is undoubtedly not debatable. But once it has been decided to punish errant employees, the unpleasant and unholy task has to be performed without feeling any professional guilt. The disciplinary action is a sacred tool with the management </P>
<P>– as sacred as a surgeon’s knife. When an operation is conducted, pain and blood loss cannot be avoided – it can only be controlled or reduced. In case of gangrene, a part of the body is amputated in order to keep the rest of the body healthy. The same principle applies to an organization as well. To keep it healthy, some of us may have to fire someone sometimes. It is necessary that the Chocolate-cream bosses acquire ‘assertive skills’. </P>
<P>In total contrast to the Chocolate-cream bosses are the Heroic bosses. Both are the two extreme poles of managerial behaviour – the former is based on managerial avoidance and the latter on managerial over-performance. Both cause decadence – both are responsible for sowing the seeds of decline in management. Who amongst the two is better will depend on one’s choice between the devil and the deep sea. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip</em><em>: The Chocolate-cream bosses have a unique strength – they are very good in building relationships. They are good team builders. They should acquire the wisdom that the purpose of their being is not to build country clubs; building good relationships must eventually get them good performance from their people. They should never develop the feeling of professional guilt while performing the so-called ‘unholy tasks.’ They must learn that the purpose is supreme. Arjuna loved Bhishma. He revered him; yet he shot the arrow for the cause for which he was fighting the battle. Do not ever have a shred of hesitation while using your assertive skills. In the anxiety to be loved by their people they should not get branded to be a jellyfish – the fish that does not have bones. A boss without a strong spinal chord cannot be assertive and cannot get the best from his people. </em></P>

<H2>5. Heroic Bosses </H2>
<P>Johnny was the Deputy Manager. </P>
<P>We were sipping coffee in a moderate restaurant when Johnny broached the topic about his future growth. Earlier he was working with me when I was posted in one of the SBUs of the organization as chief of HR functions. Later I was picked up for corporate functions at the corporate office of the company located in Bangalore. Obviously, I was in a better position to help Johnny who was recruited by me. It was the opportune time for Johnny to exploit the relationship. After all ‘relationship’ is considered one of the resources in the corporate way of life. And in the Indian Corporate World, ‘functioning’ relationships do matter – how one cultivates and maintains relations! </P>
<P>“How do you look at your career plans?” I asked. </P>
<P>“I want to head HR functions,” he replied, candidly. </P>
<P>“Which unit?” I inquired. The company had thirty strategic business units spread all over the country, each different in terms of size – small, moderate and big. The range of manpower would vary from 100 to 6000. Johnny suggested one of the big units. It was my first visit from the corporate office to the old place of posting (Hyderabad) and I did not want him to get the feeling that he was talking to his ‘corporate boss’. </P>
<P>“Even if you are posted there, how can you become HR Chief? There is a Deputy General Manager who is several levels above </P>
<P>you,” I said. I wanted to convince him in a subtle manner that this </P>
<P>career plan was not right. </P>
<P>“He is not a professional guy. You may send him back to maintenance.” His quick retort showed that he had done his homework well.. </P>
<P>“And what about the Assistant General Manager? He is a professional guy. He is three levels above your present position, and is an alumnus of one of the premier professional institutes.” I thought this would sober him down. I was grossly mistaken. </P>
<P>“Don’t bother Sir. You may post me as ‘HR Chief’ for I have the guts to control him,” was Johnny’s quick response. I found the ground quaking under my feet. I could not keep my cool and retorted, “That way you may wish even to control me if the opportunity comes to you…” My caustic remarks had no effect on him. He laughed a harsh laugh. What I could not convey to him modestly was the famous 16th century proverb: “If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.” Anyway, later I posted him to the corporate office to assist me. He was happy for sometime, then jumped the guns looking for ‘superior laps’ to get higher visibility through hobnobbing with the higher-ups. </P>
<P>Such highly ambitious managers with a ‘larger than life-size professional profile’ are not uncommon in the Corporate World. When such over-ambitious managers grow to be bosses, they become a problem for their subordinates. This Johnny also scaled the ladder of hierarchy and retired as General Manager (HR). He created havoc for his people. I will write about those episodes later. </P>
<P>First, let us analyse why managers grow into ‘Heroic bosses’! What is their psyche? Why do they over-count themselves? Why do they discount others? These are simple but hard to answer questions. </P>
<P>I remember that during my childhood days I once went with my friend to buy some chocolates. We bought two tiny toy-shaped chocolates. I still remember I had bought a chocolate-rabbit and my friend took a chocolate-elephant. When we started eating the chocolates, my friend was dismayed to find that though the elephant-shaped chocolate had looked big, it was hollow inside. He was terribly disappointed; I could see the frustration on his face. But he immediately pretended to be jubilant and remarked, “Hey! My chocolate is better than yours. Just see, it has an extra bit of chocolate in it!” </P>
<P>When a child says, “Hey, my toy is better than yours!” he is in fact adopting a defensive stand by launching an offensive as he is aware that his stuff is inferior. The inner inadequacy makes him overreact to cover the deficiency! </P>
<P>Children who suffer from an inferiority complex tend to cover their weakness by exaggerating their projections. They pretend to be superior with the complex of ‘mine is better than yours’. Their inferior chocolate-toys tend to haunt them. Since they have learnt the game of offensive defence, they continue to play many such games. </P>
<P>Tragedy strikes when a child with the life-script of a ‘rebel child’ suffers from the ‘mine is better than yours’ syndrome. These are the children who grow to become Heroic bosses. A Heroic boss tends to be larger than life. He suffers from inner inadequacies and an inferiority complex. To overcome his inner weaknesses he tends to overreact and projects himself like the Greek hero Hercules or the comic-legend, Tarzan. The urge for ‘visibility’ added to the inner inadequacy and inferiority complex stimulates him to exaggerate with false confidence. To my mind, the ‘Heroic psyche’ is the make-up to portray this ‘urge for visibility’ blended with ‘over-confidence’. I will try to explain the Heroic boss’s psyche through a matrix. </P>
<P>Psyche of a </P>
<SECTION>
<H4>Heroic Manager </H4>
<P>Overconfidence </P>
<P>Urge for visibility </P>
<P>Many believe that such bosses suffer from a ‘superiority complex’. They, however, will be really surprised to know that there is no word like ‘superiority complex’ in psychology! CG Jung underscores two frequently cited complexes – real or imaginary! The former is commonly known as ‘inferiority complex’. Sigmund Freud named the latter after the myth of Oedipus, designating childhood hostility towards the parent of the same sex and attraction towards the parent of the opposite sex. All these complexes develop during childhood. Likewise Heroic bosses develop eccentric traits during their childhood. The corporate environment just helps nurturing these traits. If the organizational climate is pure and healthy, it also helps curing their peculiar mental psyche. </P>
<P>The Heroic manager causes incalculable damage to the organization in his anxiety to stretch his arms too far and flex his muscles too frequently to over- demonstrate his professional strengths and potential. When the sea is calm, the guy gets restless. There should be some thrill that keeps him visible all the time! If he is not noticeable, he knows how to become noticeable. </P>
<P>It is apparent to all that the Heroic managers excel in overreacting and creating a crisis in anxiety so as to have the last word or to gain an upper edge over others, even his own boss! Alec Mackenzie, the author of ‘Time Trap’, has given a masterly tip to such disaster hunters: “Doing nothing is far better than managing situation into a crisis.” </P>
<P>The Heroic boss always tries to project a self-image which is larger than the assignment or even the organization. He works under the myth that the burden of the organization is on his shoulders alone. The same Johnny had once told me, “The Chairman is on a business trip. The Director will also be away for a couple of days. I want to take a day off but I can’t. Who will take care of …!” This he must be telling to others and repeating it to me totally forgetting that I was very much in the office to fill the void. He also forgot that between him and me there stood a good fleet of professionals. </P>
<P>The favourite pronoun of a Heroic boss is ‘I’. He never tires of blowing his own trumpet or beating his own drums. He is a team-breaker and a block-maker. He is like a child whose teacher has shown him only two colours – black and white. His approach is one of dichotomy – wrong or right. “Here is one phrase I hate to see on any executive’s evaluation, no matter how talented he may be, and that is – <em>He has trouble getting along with people! </em>To me, that is the kiss of death,” observes Lee Iacocca If an executive cannot get along with people it is largely due to his heroic attitude </P>
<P>– the habit of over self-projection for higher visibility in the organization. “If an executive cannot get along with his peers, what good is he to the company?” asks Lacocca. We must not forget that as an executive, his function is to motivate other people. If he cannot do that, he is wrongly placed in that position. </P>
<P>When masculine muscles are flexed and energy is expended playing such foul games by keeping one’s focus on self-gain, both organization and people suffer as authority lords over leadership. Organizational interest takes a backseat when ego-satisfaction becomes the driving force. An Egocentric boss derives satisfaction from ego-seduction. “The heroic leadership fails to make use of knowledge and competencies for which their subordinates were hired,” write David L Branford and Allan R Cohen in ‘Managing for Excellence’. </P>
<P>The driving force of a Heroic boss is the halo that comes with the position and not the objectives of the company, let alone the purpose of being regarded as supreme! In ‘Managing for the Future’, Peter F Drucker highlights the finer negative aspects of charisma which charms most of us, especially those who suffer from the Heroic syndrome. “History knows no more charismatic leaders than this century’s triad of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao – the mis-leaders who inflicted as much evil and suffering on humanity as have ever been recorded.” Likewise, Saddam of Iraq and Gaddafi of Libya were very competent leaders with enormous capabilities. But they went astray when they started feeding their ego. </P>
<P>‘Charisma’ is an addiction. It makes a leader inflexible, convinced of his own infallibility and with the inability to change. This is what happened to Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Saddam and Gaddafi. It is common knowledge, in the study of ancient history, that only Alexander’s early death saved him from becoming a hopeless failure. The greed for charisma arises out of the need for visibility and this makes these people overreact. </P>
<P>An undisputable reality is that an Ineffective manager mostly attracts the management’s concern while the disservice of Heroic bosses often goes unnoticed without concern. They sow the seeds of decline in the organization. Unfortunately, most often, persons in authority are seen with a halo of ego surrounding their heads. They, in fact, suffer from an inferiority complex. This I will say, again and again, until my tongue bleeds. </P>
<P>Greed for visibility! Yes, this greed is worse than the greed for money. </P>
<P>After working in five public sector undertakings, I joined my first private sector company. I thought the latter was going to be a model of excellence as I was always made to believe that people from public sector are ‘inefficient’. They are corporate pharaohs and corporate bureaucrats. So, suffering from an inferiority complex, I made a very shaky and unconfident beginning in the new private limited company. Later, I realized that even the superannuated techniques of public sector organizations were Latin and Greek to the so-called smart private sector top bosses. When I decided to use the technique of ‘crashed airplane’ in this so-called ‘world-class’ value-based company – the technique that was used by Reginald H Jones, the former CEO of GE (1972-81) for identifying the most deserving and acceptable internal candidate to succeed him – the heavens caved in and the news spread like wild fire. Unlike Reginald, I used this technique for locating the ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’ of my people in the HR team. Yes, identifying the crown prince was also on the back of my mind. </P>
<P>I called each manager of my team and began the way Reginald did. “Look we are travelling together and the plane crashes. Now you and I are dead but our concern about the HR Department is still alive. So take this sheet of paper and write down the strengths and weaknesses of each guy in the HR team. Also mention one or two specific dominating traits of each of your colleagues. Finally, suggest who should take over when I am not there. Don’t bother about seniority; just suggest a name according to the individual’s competence.” When some persons suggested his or her own name I used the same words of the inventor of this technique. “See, you and I are dead persons. A ghost cannot take over from another dead man!” Once this was made clear, their thinking pattern shifted onto a different track. You can appreciate a photo only when you do not see your face in the group picture. When anyone appeared to be apprehensive, I would create confidence about the secrecy of the information by saying humorously, “Look you are sharing the secret with the ghost. The dead can’t reveal secrecy!” In the same breath I would add, “Yes, never ever reveal your secrets even to the leaves for the winds will carry it and reveal to the forest.” I added value to the ‘crashed airplane’ technique and made it more effective for multi-purpose corporate use. I had used this once earlier and it did work well. By evening, the real profile of each team member was with me. I used the adjective ‘real’ because no one, except the colleague, knows better about the person. I kept to my promise of secrecy and I will not reveal the outcome even today. What I am going to share is an overall depiction of the actual situation without revealing the real names of the participants in the ‘airplane’ study. </P>
<P>To my great surprise, almost everyone wrote about Harish; apparently his appetite for ‘visibility’ was very high. He had positive traits - high level of energy as well as potential to grow. Everyone rated him very highly and regarded him to be the crown prince for succession. But the singular trait - abnormal urge for ‘visibility’was quite disappointing for me. One fact that came to the surface was his habit of denouncing the ones who were neck-to-neck with him in the race for competence. Harish emerged out as truly Heroic. When I observed him more carefully, I found lots of matching traits with Johnny though Harish had a higher degree of sophistication and a better ‘wrap up’ – a well-known common trait in the private sector. He emerged to be a team-breaker, always flexing his muscles to create some crisis in the Department. He was highly conscious of his intellectual impulses and logical pursuits. </P>
<P>I found that he was badly suffering from ‘Egotism’ and the syndrome, what I call, ‘arrogance of intelligence’. </P>
<P>For ‘kicking colleagues’ one more name came to the surface. It was Tushar. His exterior was very graceful, garnished with sophistication and refinement. After observing his behaviour carefully, I discovered that he was a tale-teller and a back-biter. He could be called a schemer but the guy certainly did not have the heroic muscles to flex. </P>
<P>At this point, I will deviate slightly from the ‘Heroic’ profile to cover something relating to systems which is without a doubt contextual. </P>
<P>In this organization, my prime responsibility or rather the ‘purpose of my being’ an Executive Vice President of Human Potential Development was to strengthen the ‘value-based’ foundation laid down by the founder. This I could have done only with the help of a team with inherent real values. But what my ‘crashed airplane’ technique revealed (I later discovered this myself) was that in my own team a few guys did not have any faith in values. They were found playing games with each other to gain personal favors by climbing over others’ shoulders or even pushing them down and climbing over their bodies. What surprised me the most was that they were nice, intelligent, highly qualified and polished guys. Each of them was professionally competent and had good potential to grow. There was enough space where each of them could have found his career-path to gain heights without kicking down the others. I observed that they were afraid and apprehensive of the others’ talents. Their competencies were taken as a threat rather than strength for the HR team! </P>
<P><SPAN>It did not take much time to discover the root-cause. detected that the real ‘culprit’ was the <em>performance management system</em>, what they used to call ‘PMS’. It was linked to incentive </SPAN>and career growth. The amount of incentive that the ‘Excellent’ senior Manager could get through PMS was as high as Rupees 200,000! The lowest slab was too low. The gap between the highest slab and the next lower slab was also quite wide. The scheme had a ‘rider’; ‘in each function-group there cannot be rated more than 5 % as high performer’. So if all the twenty guys were excellent, only one would reach the highest slab. Since the gap between the highest and the next lower slab was substantial, the guy who was competing neck-to-neck in the rat race had no option but to win ‘by hook or by crook’. And when one cannot win ‘by hook’, he becomes ‘crooked’ to win. This is what the ‘phrase’ stands for! Why blame the guys? Blame the system. </P>
<P>This deviation is relevant to underscore the point that it is not the psyche make-up alone that makes one what he Is. The organizational culture and systems also play a major part in moulding a person’s character. </P>
<P>Systems help cultivate environment. In a healthy environment efficient systems are created and even when the systems suffer from deficiencies, the environment prevents the second law of thermodynamics from causing cultural entropy. Organizational culture is of extreme relevance. Good people create good culture. If the organizational culture is ‘good’, people in the organization grow with values, virtue and wisdom. It works both ways. We allow our managers to grow like Johnny and when they become a threat to the organization we are astonished as we believe that the organization never allows values to deteriorate. </P>
<P>To make clear what I want to say, I will tell you a story. I call the hero-child of this story ‘Johnny’ as this name has become some sort of a metaphor in the organization where the real Johnny is on the rolls of the company. ‘Johnny’ as a management metaphor is also popular in some of the academic institutions that have of late </P>
<P>been using Johnny’s case study for ‘role play’ during corporate </P>
<P>training programs. </P>
<P>When Johnny was six, he was with his father when they were caught speeding. His father handed the officer a twenty-dollar bill with his driver’s license. “It’s OK, son,” his father said, as they drove off. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was eight, he was present at a family council presided over by Uncle George on the surest means to save points off the income tax returns. “It’s OK, kid,” his uncle said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was nine, his mother took him to his first movie. The box office man could not find any empty seats until his mother discovered an extra $ 5 in her purse. “It’s OK son,” she said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was fifteen, he was made right guard on the high school football team. His coach showed him how to block and at the same time grab the opposing end by the shirt so the official could not see it. “It’s OK, kid,” the coach said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was sixteen, he took his first summer job at the supermarket. His assignment was to put the overripe strawberries at the bottom of the boxes and the good ones on the top where they would be seen. “It’s OK, kid,” the manager said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was eighteen, Johnny and a neighbor applied for college scholarship. Johnny was a marginal student. His neighbor was in the upper three per cent of his class, but he could not play right guard. Johnny got the scholarship. “It’s OK, son,” his parents said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>When Johnny was nineteen, he was approached by a senior class student who offered him the test answers for $ 50. “It’s OK, kid,” he said. “Everybody does it.” </P>
<P>Johnny was caught and sent home in disgrace. “How could you do this to your mother and me?” his father said. “You never learned anything like this at home.” His aunt and uncle were also shocked. </P>
<P>Let us analyze this situation. When was it the first time that the <em>wrong</em> message was recorded as the <em>right</em> approach in the tender brain of Johnny? It was when his father was caught speeding and he handed the traffic police officer a twenty-dollar bill with his driver’s license. And when Johnny looked at his father in surprise, the little boy was consoled by his father, saying, “It’s OK, son. Everybody does it.” The innocent child took his father’s action as the way of life. Why should we then blame Johnny? </P>
<P>Had Johnny been born in today’s Singapore, his lifescript would have been quite different! Perhaps he would have grown up as a ‘Management Monk’ instead of a ‘Management Monster’. No one dares in Singapore to do as Johnny’s father did. A few years back, I was on a social visit to Singapore – the intelligent island. In the morning newspaper I found a bold heading that attracted me. The news on the first page carried an interesting story of a Malaysian driver who tried to bribe a traffic police inspector. When the driver was caught violating traffic rules he attempted to bribe the traffic inspector. The traffic inspector took this as a grave offence and put the driver behind the bars - not for violating traffic rules but for his attempt to corrupt Singapore culture. </P>
<P>Now I turn to our real Johnny, with flesh and bones. Johnny was not as Heroic as his bosses and organizational culture made him to be. No doubt, he was having a high appetite for visibility right from day one and for this, he used to overreact with unreasonable high confidence. When he came into contact with one of the Vigilance guys he learnt the trick most of the police fellows do - he found the ‘game of trapping’ so wonderful that within a short duration of time he attained high visibility and gained recognition as a corporate bloodhound. He learned the simple trick for gaining high visibility. If someone tried to flex his muscle, all Johnny had to do was to find out some weakness in that person and then write an anonymous letter against him to the CEO and send a copy to the Vigilance Department. In the Indian public sector companies, managers are highly scared of two guys - Vigilance and Government Audit! When these guys fail in catching the sharks they are content netting in some shrimps. After all the game is of numbers – how many cases have you booked? In alliance with Johnny they could make their score and Johnny could feed his hunger for visibility. </P>
<P>As if this was not enough, Johnny later got the patronage of one senior officer who was on the verge of retirement. To have a cushy job he (mis)used Johnny as his muscleman. If anybody talked ill about him, his hatchet man, Johnny, used to settle scores for him. This way Johnny became some sort of corporate vampire who used to get sadistic pleasure in chopping off heads by framing vigilance cases and initiating disciplinary enquiries. </P>
<P>When a virtuous lady compromises with her virtues or the fence falls, everyone tries to to take advantage of the situation. Likewise, when Johnny lost his corporate virtue and was recognized as a muscleman, those corrupt corporate pharaohs who were keen to make a fortune out of his ‘skills’ welcomed him. Once he lost face, he preferred to be a partner of the corporate underworld; people who were crooked and dishonest to the core. Biting others became his habit. Some people started comparing Johnny with a mad dog for good guys were afraid to be seen anywhere near to him. </P>
<P>A scorpion once requested a tortoise to help him cross the river by carrying him on his back. Since the tortoise was reluctant, the scorpion promised that he would not sting him. The tortoise decided to oblige him. When the tortoise was mid-stream, he felt a terrible pain – obviously it was from the scorpion’s sting. While both were drowning, the tortoise asked the scorpion why he had stung him after promising not to do it and knowing fully well that by doing so both would drown. “I knew, we would but what could I do? Stinging is my habit and habits die hard!” </P>
<P>With this as the background, I analyse the psyche makeup of a Heroic boss. First let me try to explain this in terms of life positions. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Life Positions Pattern </H3>
<P>Johnny falls within the life-position known as ‘I’m OK; you’re not OK’. When a person over-counts his own self and under-counts others, he gets into this position. His head swells with false pride. He becomes arrogant. ‘Arrogance gives one more visibility than humility does’ is common knowledge. The so-called successes get into his head and failures settle in the heart causing heartache. </P>
<P><SPAN>It is believed that this ‘life position’ is the reflection of a battered childhood experience. A child who is brutalized long enough by the parents will grow with the life position – I’m OK; you’re not OK. The story of ‘David Copperfield’ is a unique example of a battered childhood experience. Unusual and uncommon phenomena known as ‘self-stroking’ prevents the child from growing with the life position – I’m OK; you’re not OK. The ‘self-stroking’lifting one’s spirit through<em> self-approval</em> - prevents the child from growing with such an abnormal psyche. In the absence of such ‘self-stroking’, the child who has experienced painful injuries, such </SPAN>as those inflicted on a ‘battered child’, often grows up to be a sadist. Anyone who has suffered a broken bone or massive bruises knows the pain. Common in battered children are extremely painful injuries such as broken ribs, fractured skulls, cuts, burns, fractured bones, internal injuries, and psychological effect of mental torture. Every hour, several hundred children in Indian villages and down trodden societies receive injuries of this kind at the hands of their parents, uncles and aunts and schoolmasters. How then they can be prevented from growing up like a Johnny? </P>
<P>If the child is blessed with ‘self-stroking’ and he knows how to lick his wounds, he can heal himself and most likely will not grow as a blood-sucking monster. Such a little person has experienced brutality but he has also experienced survival without exchanging it with cruelty. What has happened can happen again. “I did survive,” he says and restores confidence in himself and others. “I will survive,” he asserts and proceeds forward. He refuses to give up. He also refuses to accept that ‘what happened to him he should do to others’. He does not choose this as the solution for his battered childhood. </P>
<P>But if such a self-healing does not take place, such a child in all probability will turn out to be a Johnny. As he grows older he begins to strike back. He has seen toughness and knows how to be tough. He has also seen hatred and knows how to mete out hatred to others. Hatred sustains him although he may learn to conceal it with a false mask of graciousness. </P>
<P>Do not get astonished! My discrete enquiries about Johnny’s childhood revealed that he did not have pleasant early days. He belonged to a poor fisherman’s family. He and his siblings had gone through bad periods of starvation during their childhood. He and his family members were looked down upon in the primitive village-society where being born in a low-caste family was considered a social crime and a religious sin. Added to this, a heart-breaking incident had shattered his psyche. A mad dog bit his brother and the boy died of rabies. Johnny had seen his brother suffering from hydrophobia and dying slowly, bit by bit, in a cage. It was such a pathetic and pitiable situation that his subconscious could never disremember it. </P>
<P>Had there been some noble soul in his proximity during those days, when his life position was taking shape, he would have learnt the art of ‘self-stroking’ and healing his wounds and psychological scars; he would have grown up to be any other person but a Johnny. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Set of Symptoms </H3>
<P>The prime characteristic being ‘urge for visibility’ coupled with ‘over-confidence’ the Heroic Manager develops certain traits that must be effective in quenching this thirst. I describe some significant characteristics of the Heroic Manager which can also be taken as his symptoms for diagnostic purposes. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>‘I’ is his identity </H3>
<P>A big ‘I’ is his identity. The pronoun ‘We’ does not find any place in his vocabulary. </P>
<P>I suggest a game that can be played in the classroom or conference hall during a training program or workshop on ‘managerial effectiveness’. Ask each participant to share some of the success and failure experiences as a manager, either in the present organization or at the earlier one. Do not make known the fact that mentally you will be counting the pronoun ‘I’ in his or her statement. This will give you some idea about one’s ‘I’ syndrome. Then, pick up the guy with maximum ‘I’ and the one with the least ‘I’. Ask these two guys to come to the centre of the classroom </P>
<P>and converse on any topic. The rule of the game is simple: once one of the two uses the pronoun ‘I’ in any context he loses the game. Both should converse in a normal manner. They cannot take time to weigh their words or pause while talking. You conduct this conversational exercise with two or three couples, one by one, and you will find that those whom you identified for using ‘I’ more frequently lose the game each time. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Mine is better than yours </H3>
<P>As mentioned earlier, when a child says, “Hey, my toy is better than yours!” he understands that his toy is inferior. Before anybody can point out this obvious fact, he uses this phrase to launch some sort of ‘defensive action’. The Heroic managers are mostly defensive, always defending their actions and choices. </P>
<P>When Johnny bought a twenty-year-old Fiat car he started justifying the deal to everybody – how he had made such a ‘good buy’! Whenever the old car used to halt on the road, due to an engine problem, he would blame the service stations for not carrying out proper repairs or for selling adulterated petrol. Sometimes he would blame dust in the city insisting that it chokes the carburetor. In the same breath he would appreciate the English engine and its components little realizing that it was an Italian product. My toy is always better than the others! </P>
<P>It was only when he could afford a new Suzuki, he blamed the old Fiat. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Highly Egoistic</H3>
<P> Only those who suffer inner inadequacies behave larger than life. Heroic boss has a big ego. A big ego has sharp angles and corners that stick out everywhere. You cannot get near such a person without getting hurt. Yet it is very easy to manage such fellows with a big ego. Someone will simply butter his ‘royal slice of toast’ and outsmart the too smart Heroic boss! His urge for visibility is so high that he becomes myopic and fails to make a distinction between praise and appeasement. It is fine so long as people see him standing tall. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Buttering the royal slice of toast </H3>
<P>Johnny has a coarse voice. To flatter him, his people started praising his voice. They fooled him so seriously that the guy once insisted in the church that he would lead chorus-hymns in the Sunday prayers. The other incident of his clowning that I can hardly forget was about his claim that he was a good athlete and a champion! During the inter-unit sports meet of the company he participated in the ‘High Jump’ event. He chose to make a big start by running almost twenty yards or so, and when he approached the poles he simply went under the crossbar instead of jumping over it! </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Highly ambitious </H3>
<P>Heroic bosses are highly ambitious. Their ambition is a mismatch to their competence. They want to grow or succeed largely for gaining more visibility and to prove their competence. Those who are really competent need not prove anything to anybody. As Lao Tzu says, “Great people never compete.” When you compete you meet ‘competition’. People of excellence operate from a higher plane and always stay par excellence. As they do not compete with anyone, no one competes with them. They meet no competition. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Overconfident </H3>
<P>It is the urge of visibility that makes the Heroic managers behave overconfidently. </P>
<P>Once, Johnny came to our place with his family. My wife, two kids and I were taking evening tea in the courtyard. There was a coconut grove and other fruit plants in the courtyard. Johnny asked us why we did not we get the coconuts plucked. Then he immediately asserted that he could do it. He claimed that as he came from the State where coconut trees are grown in every courtyard, he was an expert in doing so. He shared with us the fact that during childhood he used to pluck fruits by climbing up trees much higher and straighter than the ones I had in my courtyard. Despite our preventing him, he started clambering up the tree. When he had reached more than two-third the height, he lost stamina and we could see him gasping. He was profusely sweating and his eyeballs were virtually popping out just like what we see in the Tom and Jerry animation cartoons. We did not know what to do! My son, Feroz, and little daughter, Fairy, rushed and brought a bed sheet asking us to stretch it out so that if he fell down we could provide some protection. No exaggeration, it’s a true tale! </P>
<P>As a management guy, I shouted out a loud appreciation to boost his morale. I asked him to hold the trunk and rest for a while, and then slowly come down. I told him that he could go up and pluck not one but all the coconuts but I did not wanted them just now. After sometime the drama came to an end when the guy managed to climb down unhurt. He said, “I have climbed down because you asked me not to pluck the coconuts.” Even in such defeatist situation he still held his tail up! </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Over-counting self, under-counting others </H3>
<P>I still remember the first lesson of HRD that was taught to me more than thirty years ago – ‘Never discount self; never discount others.’ Much later I understood it fully and could relate it to the ‘life position’: ‘I’m OK; you’re OK’. But the Heroic bosses always over-count themselves and under-count others. They are the guys who will teach the fish to swim and the eagles to fly! </P>
<P>The HRD team had evolved a new policy for medical assistance to employees and their families. I insisted that it should be discussed threadbare with the medical guys before it was introduced even on a ‘dry-run’ basis. Johnny called the meeting with a lot of hesitation. Being the chief architect, he did not want the draft to be discussed with the medical officers as he was convinced they would understand nothing about the company’s policy. However, under pressure, he finally called for the meeting. It was disgusting watching Johnny teaching medical science to the medical officers. When subtle signals could not stop him I had to be harsh with him. I still feel sorry for doing this for it was not a nice gesture on my part. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Disaster Hunters </H3>
<P>Heroic bosses are disaster hunters. They feel uncomfortable when there is no crisis. Managing or mismanaging crisis provides enormous visibility to such heroes. If the crisis was not there, they would create one. </P>
<P>Once at a post business session, an HRD colleague of mine confided that first he used to create a situation and allow it to aggravate and then intervene to resolve the problem only when his boss would look at him for help. He spoke softly, “I’m then taken as a Messiah!” </P>
<P>What will one call this? ‘Self seduction’! Perhaps yes. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Team destructor </H3>
<P>The Heroic managers who grow to be Heroic bosses are not team-builders. They are team destructors. Team does not get any one individual mileage. The Heroic manager as well as Heroic boss strives for individual mileage to get visibility. As a team member, he finds his self is totally lost. </P>
<P>Both Johnny and Harish (who later grew to be horrible bosses) used to plead that no time be wasted in team building for teamwork does zero good. I agree that if team building is favoured for averaging out performance, then such critical views against team performance make some sense. One can always maintain the average body temperature by putting one’s head in the oven and the legs in the freezer! This example is stupid but it makes the management phenomenon simple and understandable. </P>
<P>Averaging the team performance will not work anymore. “We began this century with companies doing their level best to suppress differences between individuals,” observes Chuck Lucifer, Chief Growth Officer, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. “Now we are seeing that the way to improve productivity is to get more out of each individual.”</P>
<P> Heroic managers, however, have no such arguments. They are against team building itself. They oppose teams for they lose their individual identity and visibility. They harm teams in two ways. Firstly, they dominate others and try to put them off. Secondly, they snatch others’ work by entering into their areas and then try to create redundancy for others. Their failures surface much later; by that time the damage has been already done. When a surgeon makes a mistake, the patient dies on the operation table. When a structural engineer does a mistake, the bridge collapses after a few months. But the blunder of an HRD manager is too costly – by the time one realizes the mistake, the organization is already gone. As each organization has a Johnny in abundance it is no wonder that each organization has started collapsing. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Hunger for High Visibility </H3>
<P>The prime cause for the makeup of the Heroic manager, and the later Heroic boss, is abnormal hunger for high visibility. I have made this abundantly clear earlier. </P>
<P>Once Johnny succeeded in getting a General Manager (Finance) sacked. As the story goes, when Johnny tried to act ‘funny’ with him by flexing his heroic muscles as usual, the General Manager (Finance) asked him to get out of his room or else he would throw him out of the window. Johnny could not bear this humiliation as he was insulted in the presence of the charming secretary who could not help smiling. Johnny made a game plan. He made discrete enquiries and discovered some fault that went against the GM (Finance). He joined hands with the Vigilance to get the GM sacked. On the day the termination orders were to be served, the victim was on leave. Johnny took advantage of the situation and got his room sealed. He also posted the termination orders on the corporate notice boards which was not really required. Johnny was seen running in the corridor with the Security and Vigilance fellows making everybody say, ‘Hey – here is the hero!’ </P>
<P>Sometimes in the anxiety to look Heroic the guy engages in buffoonery. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Healing Prescriptions for Heroic Bosses </H3>
<P>A syndrome is a psychiatric disease and behavioural disorder. A disease is supposed to be cured. A behavioural disorder needs to be corrected and restored. We may call this ‘healing’. </P>
<P>That who suffer from this disease – a disease that excites them to overreact to gain corporate visibility – can be cured. The behavioural disorder can be restored to normal if sincere efforts are made. </P>
<P>I suggest two techniques as ‘restorative prescriptions’ to cure the mis-managers suffering from Heroic syndrome. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>(1) Creative Aggression </H3>
<P>‘Creative aggression’ is the first healing technique. </P>
<P>If one cares to diagnose the Heroic syndrome, he will know that the guy has enormous energy. A Heroic manager is the powerhouse of enormous energy ready to burst out. If not used, this energy will find alternative routes for its release or bust the container. One cannot stop the flow of this energy. Yes, one can utilize the energy and consume it for both good and bad effects. The exploiters used Johnny’s explosive energy for negative corporate functions. It could well be utilized for positive functions where the activity could have added commercial value, EVA – economic value addition. </P>
<P>Let me make this more simple… </P>
<P>You cannot hit a six without using enormous force if the ball is bowled at a slow pace. ‘Fast paced bowling’ can be utilized for hitting a six but if your bat misses the ball, you will be clean-bowled. </P>
<P>Life energy is like a cloud full of rainwater – it has to rain. Likewise, human potential has to be tapped. If not tapped for the right cause, the energy will find its own direction. The unguarded missile is always dangerous – it hits the unintended one! </P>
<P>The Heroic manager is like an unguarded missile. So what is important is <em>how to harness his energy</em> for organizational needs. ‘Creative Aggression’ is one such technique which can be used for exploiting the strengths and energies of a Heroic manager. What is required in effect is to ignite the spark and take the edge off the arrogance and harshness. The overassertive forces, which go against the organizational interests, can be diverted into the mainstream by converting the ‘aggression’ into ‘creative aggression’ just like the fast ball is effortlessly hit through the slips to score a six. The aggressive spark and reactive forces can be made favourable and supportive for the organization. </P>
<P>In Chinese martial arts, Jujitsu enables one to overcome a physically superior opponent by just using the attacker’s own energy against him. Judo, a Japanese sports created later in 1882, was also based on Jujitsu. Other popular forms – Kung Fu, Karate, and Taekwondo – also emphasize blows with the feet and the side of the hand. Kendo makes use of ‘bamboo swords’ covered with leather. All these forms of martial arts are based on the same principle, i.e. using the attacker’s own energy against him. In other words – the aggression is made creative by making the force favourable. </P>
<P>This restorative technique, viz. ‘Creative Aggression’, includes a bit of counselling and in extreme cases, psychological therapy. Creating awareness is the best medicine. Let the guy understand that his basic ailment is the unreasonable urge for visibility. All his heroic actions are the result of this syndrome. Since the life position of the Heroic manager is ‘I’m OK, you’re not OK’, in extreme cases, in his normal life such a guy can commit genocide. In corporate life they commit corporate genocide by harassing people; picking holes and then making mountains out of molehills. </P>
<P>The Heroic managers must be made aware of the fact that trickery succeeds sometimes but it always commits suicide in the end. </P>
<P>The other healing technique that I would suggest may be called ‘Supportive confrontation’. </P>

<H3>(2) Supportive Confrontation </H3>
<P>‘Supportive Confrontation’ is another restorative prescription that can be experimented with to tame the Heroic manager who suffers from the psychiatric disease – egomania. The ‘urge for visibility’ causes egomania. This urge persistently incites the patient to have the last say in every decision to gain a leading edge. </P>
<P>The technique of ‘Supportive Confrontation’ involves two steps - ‘support’ and ‘confront’. This appears to be a paradox but that is what life all about! Life is a paradox by itself. </P>
<P>So what you need to do is confront the Heroic manager’s ‘egotism’ and support his ‘intellectual impulses’ and ‘energy’. Thus, his egotism can be strongly confronted by lending latent support to the intellectual part of his total behaviour. This technique is effective only when a unique equilibrium between <em>confrontation </em>and <em>support</em> is maintained. Confront what is wrong and harmful; support what is right and good for the organization. </P>
</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<H3>Conclusion </H3>
<P>In the end, let me make it loud and clear that Heroic managers and Heroic bosses possess certain positive qualities that cannot and should not be discounted.. The organization should make use of the ‘fire in his belly’.. “It is better to be seen as ‘stubborn’ than ‘incompetent’,” believes Peter Block. It is not very difficult to tame a Heroic manager. But, contrarily, it is foolhardy to expect a jellyfish to suddenly have a bone. </P>
<P>The identification of Heroic managers in any organization is as important as that of a low performer for HRD intervention and behavioural therapy. The former deserves priority over the latter. </P>
<P>It is not difficult to locate a Heroic manager or a Heroic boss </P>
<P>– he is always visible flexing his masculine muscles. Only if we miss the joker in the pack will a Johnny go unnoticed. This can only happen when the camel walks through the eye of a needle! </P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> Heroic bosses, despite many weaknesses, possess one excellent leadership trait – fire in the belly. If they control their ego and one-upmanship, they can deliver wonderful results. They are not hopeless cases; their seniors should work on them. They have energy; one must know how to use it in the right direction ! </em></P>

<H2>6. Narcissistic Bosses </H2>
<P>During my college days, Dr Insaf was a very famous doctor of Bhopal. He used to narrate a story to his medical students about his unique experience during his practical diagnosis test, a part of his post-graduation final examination. To test his diagnostic skill, he was made to diagnose a patient who was so normal in behaviour that he panicked and started sweating with the ticking away of time. He used all his wiles and guiles to induce the patient to come out with his problem. But the man did not relent. Dr Insaf then decided to write down his diagnosis declaring the patient to be a normal person. He was convinced that the examiners had tried to outsmart him by sending a normal person as a patient for diagnosis. </P>
<P>Dr Insaf nervously took out his cigarette case to take out a cigarette. The patient swiftly jumped out of the bed and picked up his cigarette pack from the side rack. He offered a cigarette to the doctor. The doctor, while taking the cigarette, casually asked him why he was offering him a cigarette from his pack? The patient smiled and the doctor noticed, for the first time, an abnormal wildness in his eyes. The patient said, “Doctor, this is a very special cigarette. Only two persons in the world use this brand </P>
<P>– me and the Duke of Edinburgh.” Without giving it a second thought, Dr Insaf wrote down the diagnosis – The patient is suffering from what Freud referred to as ‘Narcissism’. </P>
<P>As America is the best example of ‘political Narcissism’; there are many CEOs from this very country who suffer from ‘management Narcissism’. They are such acute patients of this disease that they spend millions of the company’s dollars on ‘PR’ to project their ‘I’ image. Unfortunately, we hear and learn only about them through the PR agency which successfully projects them as corporate mavens. Others, who are the real business leaders, remain in anonymity. ‘Business Narcissism’ has become the most accepted pattern not only in America and the other Western countries but also in India. Many CEO’s spend their company’s money to project themselves. They pay money to the press and electronic media to get personal media coverage. In their interviews, they highlight their ‘individual’ contribution. In simple words, they make their audience believe that they are taller than the company. </P>
<P>The Narcissistic bosses mostly belong to the clan of ‘Heroic bosses’. Due to their ‘narcissism’ they develop the heroic syndrome. It works the other way as well. Since they suffer from ‘heroic’ syndrome they engage ‘PR’ agencies for their projection. Both ‘Narcissism’ and ‘self-deception’ are their survival mechanism. In today’s Corporate World, especially in Corporate America, many CEOs go to PR agencies for their self-projection. In such a rat race, those who do not follow this practice become the losers although they are second to none. </P>
<P>The term ‘Narcissism’ was introduced in 1887 by Alfred Binet, but its usage today stems from Freud’s essay ‘On Narcissism’ that he wrote in the year 1914. In Greek mythology, Narcissus was a handsome young man who rejected all potential lovers but then tragically fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. The word ‘Narcissist’ came from ‘Narcissus’ – the lovelorn Greek legendary hero. </P>
<P>To my mind, Narcissists are ‘self centered’ people. How to deal with such self-centered Narcissistic bosses is a serious question. Many ask me during my workshops, ‘How can we survive with a boss who has an EGO taller than the Khalifa Tower of Dubai?” </P>
<P>The answer is not simple. I ask certain investigatory questions about their bosses: Is your boss, he or she, fond of using ‘I’ more often than the pronoun ‘We’? Is he or she very conscious of his or </P>
<P>her looks, dress and whole appearance? Does he or she consistently exhibit immoral and unethical behavior to project his or her own image? Does he or she delight in another’s misery? Does he or she, with very little effort, manipulate situations? Does he or she frequently change opinions or doctrines, i.e. do a ‘flip-flop’? If the answer is ‘Yes!’ to any of these questions about the behavior of the boss, then my answer is, “Yes! You have a Narcissistic boss.” </P>
<P>These bosses are unpleasant to deal with and do not value their subordinates. If you can handle this and furthermore, are willing to play their game and supply them with what they crave, great! You will have no issue with them. Do not complain; do not expect them to act normally, ethically or soberly. If you can reconcile with their bad behavior, minimize your participation and make use them – they will prove to be good tools. Play the game by always saying, ‘Wow!’ in response to their over-projection. If you play this game, play it cleverly so that you boss is not aware of your game-plan. Even if they finally do understand what you are up to, they will not mind as they feel happy in being pleased. This is a very simple technique adopted by many people while dealing with ‘Narcissistic bosses’. </P>
<P>The other way to tackle such bosses is to stand firm and give them the feeling that you are <em>not interested</em>! Be business-like. Listen to them but while giving an answer, keep focus on the issue and ignore the rest as if you have not heard anything. Believe me, they will become more polite to you; not immediately but certainly after having a few trial discussions with you. </P>
<P>If your self-respect and dignity are too dear to you, it is better to distance yourself from these bosses. But in the same breath I will add that you cannot run away from them. We are human beings, and each one of us suffers from a ‘Narcissistic syndrome’ – it is simply a question of the degree of narcissism. </P>
<P>Tips to Narcissistic Bosses </P>
<P>I would suggest that the Narcissistic Bosses must read the </P>
<P>Panchatantra – the masterpiece work of the great Hindu scholar, </P>
<P>Pandit Vishnu Sharma. There are many stories which will sober </P>
<P>them down. I quote one of these stories which is relevant here. Once there lived a tortoise in a large pool. He had made friends with two swans. The three friends loved one another very much. The swans daily came to the tank. After having a hearty swim they would perch on a rock on the bank of the pool. The tortoise would also come there and sit on the rock. All the three would sit and chat for hours happily. This went on for a number of years. </P>
<P>Now, one year it so happened that there was a long drought. The rains failed and there were no good crops. As a result, a famine broke out. Men, women, children and animals died in large numbers. Birds also flew to safer regions where it had rained in plenty. So the swans also decided to leave the area and go somewhere else. They were worried about their dear friend, the tortoise. What would he do? </P>
<P>The tortoise also felt worried. At the same time, he felt extremely pleased at the love his friends had for him. He said, in a voice choked with emotion, “Friends! I am really grateful to you for your concern about my future. But what is to be, must be. Who can go against His will? You must fly to some safe place. My best wishes are with you.” The swans wept to hear the words of the tortoise. They said, ‘No, we must do something to help you. It is our duty as your true friends. If we do not stand by you at this dark hour, we would not be able to pardon ourselves.” </P>
<P>So, the swans thought hard and at last hit upon a workable plan. They decided that they would look for a strong stick that could bear the weight of the tortoise. The tortoise was to hold the middle of the stick in his mouth. The swans would hold each end in their beaks. Then they would fly in the sky slowly, carrying the tortoise with them. </P>
<P>When the swans told the tortoise about their plan, he became too joyous. He thanked his friends once again for their anxiety about his safety. </P>
<P>“But there is a serious danger too,” said one of the swans. </P>
<P>“What is that? Let me know,” said the tortoise. </P>
<P>“If by chance you try to speak, you are sure to fall down and be killed,” explained the swan. </P>
<P>“Why should I be that foolish? I shall, in no case, utter a word as long as we are flying high up in the sky. Nor shall I open my mouth for any reason,” said the tortoise, in a reassuring tone. So, the swans brought a strong stick. The tortoise held it tightly in his mouth while each swan held one end of the stick in its beak. Before taking off, the swans reminded the tortoise once again that he was not to open his mouth at all. Up went the three friends as the swans slowly took off from the bank of the pool. Soon they reached the higher layers of the air. They flew over fields, hills and forests. All the three friends were very happy that their plan was working well. </P>
<P>During the course of their flight, the three friends flew over a village. The children of the village were playing outside it. One child happened to look up and saw the strange sight in the sky. He told his mates about it and all of them looked up. The children had never seen anything like that before. They clapped their hands shouting at the top of their voices, “Look! Look! Two birds are carrying a tortoise by means of a stick. What a wonderful sight!” </P>
<P>The shouts of the children made the tortoise uneasy. He was annoyed. “Why are these foolish guys only appreciating my friends and not me?” thought the tortoise, “I am firmly holding the stick and taking a great risk with my life!” Lost in these thoughts, the tortoise forgot all about the danger that would be there if he opened his mouth. The more the children shouted appreciating the swans, the more upset the tortoise felt. Eventually he could not control his anger and shouted, “Oh! You foolish fellows, appreciate my courage and skills as well…” </P>
<P>As soon as the tortoise opened his mouth to speak, his hold on the stick was lost. Down he came, tumbling through the air from a great height. The tortoise fell down on the ground with a loud thud. As a result he died. He died just to hear a few words of appreciation. </P>
<P>Many managers and many bosses would die to hear a few words of appreciation. </P>
<P>‘Self appreciation’ is a human weakness. It is harmless to others. It harms the one who suffers with this syndrome – Narcissism! </P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> Believe me, Narcissistic Bosses are harmless creatures – their only hunger is ‘Praise’. If you cannot feed them, at least hear what he or she says. What do you lose if you hear patiently the same story of your boss’s achievement one hundred times? As a boss, he surely enjoys this much right over you! </em></P>

<H2>7. Crooked Bosses </H2>
<P>Now I share some of my experiences in the private sector organization. At the later part of my career, I quit my board level position in a public sector company of Bangalore and joined a private sector company where I had to build and develop values in employees. I was told it was a value-based company. Yes, it was! The founder was a noble soul, and so was his descendant, the Managing Director. The purpose of my being in the company was to preserve the core values and stimulate the corporate soul. At the corporate level we had nine jewels – the top team. I was also a part of this ‘Navaratna’. The outside image of the company was that it was a ‘Star company’. The insiders used to say, “It is a company of ‘Stars’.” Both connotations seem to be phonetic and poetic yet they give quite the opposite meaning. </P>
<P>In this company I found many Heroic managers – who were much more stronger and ruthless muscle-men than Johnny. Corporate hangmen or hatchet men would be a more appropriate word for them. Here I found high profile, sophisticated professional stalwarts standing tall and always wearing a false smile on their face. In fact, they were suffering from the same psychiatric ailment </P>
<P>– inner inadequacy. </P>
<P>Mahadev (not his real name), one of the functional directors of the company, used to consider himself the de-facto Chairman. To build up his Heroic image, he used to follow a wonderful <SPAN>strategy. Through his actions and company’s policies he used to send strong signals to people – <em>please me to prosper; if you displease me, thou shall perish</em>. </SPAN></P>
<P>There is so much to share to educate my readers about these crooked corporate bosses, but I am committed to do equal justice with each mis-manager and narrate misadventures relating to their respective ‘sport’. So, I will be sharing my experiences relating to only one or two Crooked Bosses. </P>
<P>Once, Mahadev and I were finalizing the list to promote junior and middle level executives. I am very cooperative and always give due respect to the Head of the Department’s recommendations for he knows better about the candidate than anyone else. But my humility was taken as my weakness. Mahadev insisted that an accountant, who was not even in the executive cadre, should be promoted to the higher executive position, which was a two-step higher rank. I found that his appraisals were good but that this did not justify granting him a ‘double-jump’ promotion. Such a promotion would create an imbalance in the clearly defined company’s career-growth policy. Mahadev, however, was quite insistent. When discussions became serious, I took a stern position and said a firm, ‘No’. As an Executive Vice President (Human Potential Development), ensuring judicious career growth for everyone within the confines of defined policies was my responsibility. </P>
<P>“I concede,” he smiled. I thought the issue settled. But when both of us were about to sign details of the proceedings, he asked, “Moid, tell me why you said ‘No’ to my proposal? Do you think the guy I am recommending is not competent?” </P>
<P>Crooked Bosses 109 </P>
<P>“No, Mahadev. It is not for any reason other than the company’s present policy. If I allow the guy a two-step higher position by overriding the company’s policy on the basis of your recommendations, I don’t know how many such high-fliers I will be de-motivating for they are invisible to my eyes as they don’t have ‘Mahadevs’ as their powerful bosses.” </P>
<P>“Oh, I see!” His smile was colder than the biting winter wind in the Himalayas. “So, we agree to go as per the system?” </P>
<P>“Yes,” I said. </P>
<P>“Are you free tomorrow? I want to sit and talk with you for a few minutes,” he said. </P>
<P>“Yes, tell me at what time?” I enquired. </P>
<P>“Say, ten in the morning.” </P>
<P>“OK,” I said. When I was about to leave he asked, “Will you not ask the purpose of our meeting?” He smiled and then laughed. After maintaining the suspense for some time he said, “Tomorrow I shall call the same guy for interview for the post of Deputy Manager and both of us shall select him.” He paused and then clarified, “The guy will resign from the position of accountant and will come as an outside candidate.” I had nothing to say as sometimes it is wiser not to say anything. </P>
<P>“I hope this will go with the system.” The suggestion was so simple and his voice so humble that using the word ‘caustic’ will be unjust. I thought for a while. Then added the name of the guy in the list and offered the proceedings for his signature. When Mahadev was hell bent to bend the rules to find an escape route that would give a much louder signal than the corporate sin I was going to commit, I thought it wiser not to stretch too much for ‘too little’. </P>
<P>We signed the proceedings and parted. He waved his hand with a winner’s smile and his body language said, “Good guy… go with me…” </P>
<P>Later, I understood the reason behind his most unreasonable act – he wanted to send signals about his Heroic presence in the organization - that he was capable of bending the rules of the company if he decided to favour someone. It was he who called the shot! </P>
<P>Such crooked bosses always build ‘Power Centres’. For building power centres only positive signals are not enough. People must also be terrorized by sending out negative signals – to know what happens if someone opposes such bosses! </P>
<P>Mahadev was the perfect model of a ‘crooked boss’. There are many stories about his terrorising people giving clear indications that anyone who dared to raise a voice against him would not survive in the organization. </P>
<P>Now I share another incident where Mahadev tried to send negative signals to make people believe that whosoever dared to raise a voice against him would be hounded in the organization. </P>
<P>Once KP (not his real name), Managing Director, called me and shared with me the fact that a lady, who was his secretary during his earlier career in the company, was being underutilized. He wanted me to assess her potential and redeploy her. After coming back to my room, I asked my secretary to arrange a meeting with that lady. Her name was Sheela (not the real name). My secretary was shocked and advised me, “Sir, it would be wise not to meet this lady.” </P>
<P>Crooked Bosses 111 </P>
<P>“Why?” I asked. </P>
<P>“Sheela is an accursed person… no one talks to her,” she replied, hesitantly. </P>
<P>“Accursed person!” I was shocked to hear these words. On my insistence, my secretary revealed some secrets to me about this lady after taking my word that I would never disclose her name. She was quite afraid and hesitant to do so. If I not been her boss, she would never have obliged me. It appears that before the death of the founder Chairman, his son, KP, was occupying the position of Manager. Sheela was his secretary. She was a very bold lady. She never liked Mahadev, who was the then General Manager (Finance). She knew that the fellow was a crooked boss and many ladies used to come to her to cry on her shoulder. It appears that Sheela dared to raise her voice against him. Mahadev called her and cautioned her that if she did not stop her ‘silent campaign’ against him she would be punished severely. Since Sheela was also occupying a powerful position – Personal Secretary to the son of the founder Chairman – she never bothered about Mahadev’s threat. </P>
<P>Mahadev was very cunning. He took advantage of the goodness of the founder Chairman and managed to become head of finance. Now he had all the keys to the company’s finances. After sometime, the founder Chairman passed away. Since KP, who took over as Managing Director of the company after his father’s death, was quite junior to Mahadev and did not know much about company’s finances, he banked heavily upon Mahadev. This way Mahadev became the de-facto Managing Director. KP shifted to the MD’s chamber where the former MD’s senior secretary was already in charge. Sheela remained in the old office as secretary to a Manager and became anchorless. It was time for Mahadev to take revenge. He called her and asked her to sit at a desk in the corner without any work. Soon people came to know that Sheela was in Mahadev’s bad books. People stopped meeting her. She was totally isolated. KP wanted to help her, but he too never wanted to displease Mahadav who was the real controller of the company’s finances. Mahadev played another mischief. He brought his own co-brother and made him in-charge of the ‘Finance subsidiary company’ dealing with financial ventures. Thus, the entire finance of the holding company as well as the subsidiary company came under his control - directly and indirectly. </P>
<P>When I heard Sheela’s story, I decided to intervene and do something. I asked my secretary to call for Sheela. Next day Sheela came to me. I found she was quite competent. She was very good in communicating with the personnel. I decided to redeploy her in my corporate communication department. She was quite happy, yet nervous. </P>
<P>“Sir, perhaps you are not aware of my background…,” she told me hesitantly. </P>
<P>“Not fully,” I replied. She waited for sometime and narrated the entire story. She also mentioned that she had been severely punished – she lost her career. She was also penitent about having used some strong words against a very senior authority. I was fully convinced that it was a very deserving case for ‘rehabilitation’. </P>
<P>“Look for a new life. The curse is over,” I replied. She broke down. After many years, she had finally found someone speaking to her softly, sympathetically and confidently. </P>
<P>Later I talked to Sheela’s boss and informed him that I was transferring her and giving him another stenographer. He had no </P>
<P>Crooked Bosses 113 </P>
<P>issues. I asked my secretary to prepare the transfer orders of Sheela. She began preparing the transfer orders. My phone buzzed. Normally my secretary lifts the phone but I lifted it. To my great astonishment, Mahadev was on line. </P>
<P>“Moid, how are you?” His voice was very soft and tone humble. “I am at Delhi…,” he paused and then asked, “I heard you are planning to shift Sheela from her present position?” I thought for a while and said, “Yes, Mahadev.” </P>
<P>“Moid, you are new to this organization. Many things you do not know. I am coming back tomorrow. I will come to your room to have a nice hot cup of coffee.” He was very cordial and friendly. </P>
<P>“Sure, “ I reciprocated, in the same friendly tone. “I would love to welcome you. But, Mahadev, I know the story of Sheela. I also know that she used certain words against you which she should have not used. I met her and she has realized her mistake…” </P>
<P>“Moid, don’t believe her words. She is a crooked lady. I am sure she must have also shed crocodile tears,” replied Mahadev. I was wondering about the fact that he knew everything that had happened inside my room. I did not know what to say next. </P>
<P>Then I heard him say, “Keep the transfer orders pending till I return.” It seemed like he was issuing an order to me. I dislike people using this tone with me but I kept my cool and tried to convince him once again that her case was a fit case for rehabilitation. He got annoyed and said, “You will not issue the transfer orders.” I lost my cool and retorted, “Mahadev, you are late – her transfers orders have already been issued.” I told a white lie. </P>
<P>“Then, you should withdraw the orders immediately.” </P>
<P>“Mahadev, perhaps you are not aware that once I sign the paper it cannot be withdrawn. Even KP cannot withdraw it.” I lost my temper and gave him a hard verbal punch. He, however, was determined to have a last laugh. </P>
<P>“Moid – <em>agar aap ne zaher peene ka soch hi liya hai tho aap zuroor zaher peeyenge</em>.” He spoke to me in chaste Hindi. Though he was a Tamilian, he spoke good Hindi interspersed with chaste Urdu words. What he told me this time was not mere words but a threat - “If you have decided to drink poison, you shall drink poison.” </P>
<P>I went ahead with my plans. Sheela reported to the Corporate Communication Chief. Many times I have given her assignments directly and she always lived up to my expectations. She was an asset which was wasted for more than two years. </P>
<P>Later, Mahadev met me many times but never spoke a single word about that episode. I thought he had given up and preferred to forget it. But I was wrong! </P>
<P>As an HR guy, I always reflect. I tried to find out the possible causes as to why Mahadev was against me. There could be many reasons but one of the reasons was my entry into the organization </P>
<P>-I was perhaps the only person inducted into such a senior position without any formal interview. KP, the Managing Director of the company, had chatted with me at an informal meeting and asked me to join the company. I accepted his offer not because of the attractive pay package but because of the founder’s value system. This had created a great deal of suspicion in the mind of Mr. Crooked – <em>Who is this guy who made an entry without any formal interview? </em>The other reason for his considering me his <em>bête noire </em>was my weak predecessor who was too submissive to counter </P>
<P>Crooked Bosses 115 </P>
<P>Mahdev’s ego. He never opposed him or said ‘No’ to his commands. Later, I came to know that he was afraid of Mahadev and yielded to his whims and fancies – playing safe to protect his job. As I had mentioned earlier, though Mahadev was only a Director he wielded the clout of a Managing Director. When I got into the saddle, he expected the same ‘spineless’ behaviour from me. When I demonstrated courage and refused to bow down, he was determined to teach me a lesson. </P>
<P>Now let me reveal to you the result – the final outcome of my tussle with Mahadev. </P>
<P>Murugan (not his real name), President, Agri-group, was Mahadev’s blind follower. They were always together – the bondage of some ‘common interests’ is always strong. </P>
<P>Those were the days we were making lots of changes in the corporate structure with the assistance of world-class consulting services. During this ‘<em>parivartan</em>’ time, HBR (Harvard Business Review) came out with an article on a ground-breaking theme, “The Centre-less Organization”. It was a new theme with focus on the extreme degree of ‘decentralization’. This module suited the sector chiefs (business group chiefs) as it further strengthened their autonomy. </P>
<P>All through my career, I have preached for and practised ‘Empowerment’. I am not against functional ‘autonomy’ but when it comes to overall business strategies, with focus on the larger interests of the company, such autonomy needs to be redefined. The maxim ‘Power corrupts – absolute power corrupts absolutely’ is not all that hollow. To cut the story short, the idea to demolish ‘corporate HR’ was sold by these two corporate Pharaohs through the consulting agency in line with the HBR article. It was not their <SPAN>first attempt; earlier also they had tried to ‘play’ with me but did not succeed. When you throw a lot of spaghetti at the wall, one may stick to it. This last spaghetti stuck well. It was decided by KP to go for a ‘centre-less organizational structure’. Since it could be of an equal threat to some other corporate functional heads, including Corporate Finance, the consulting agency was ‘misused’ to suggest that the implementation process would be carried out in a ‘phased manner’ – Corporate Human Potential Development (HR) became the first casualty. KP (Managing Director) never wanted me to leave. He had many alternative plans for utilizing my services gainfully. But, in principle, respecting the new ‘centreless structure’, I chose to depart. </SPAN></P>
<P>‘Virtues help some to rise to lofty heights; the same virtues can make the noble fall!’ I left the organization with head held high! The second phase, as I could foresee, never materialized. The so-called ‘Centre-less Organization’, which was planned with a skewed objective, never became the reality. </P>
<P>After leaving the company, I had a heart-to-heart talk with the son of KP (who is the present MD of the company). I gave him an honest feedback about Mahadev’s policy of terrorizing and demoralizing people. I also gave him evidence. He was fully convinced that Mahadev was not only crooked but also corrupt. He was eating the company’s money like termites eat the wood. He took this up with his father and Mahadev was asked to leave the company. His exit was most disgraceful. By that time, Murugan had also seen that the wind was blowing against both of them. So, he too found another job and quit. </P>
<P>The drama ended, proving that truth always wins over falsehood. </P>

<P>Tips for Crooked Bosses </P>
<ol>
<LI>Trickery works – it works well; not only for some time but for most of the time. But eventually it commits suicide. Duration may vary but the eventual end is predestined. </LI>
<LI>The result that one obtains from crooked means can also be obtained from straight transactions. The only difference between the two is that in the latter case you may not get 100% of what you wanted but you will get long term benefits - much more than what you could have achieved through your crookedness. The second benefit of getting results via straight means is that you remain protected from the ‘causations’ – the Universal Law of Energy response which is also known as the ‘Law of Cause and Effect’. </LI>
<LI>Just to reveal something more about Mahadev. The story did not end with his losing the job. He joined another famous IT company, misguided the CEO by luring him to invest public money in ‘Real Estate’ and when things went wrong, he and his CEO were put behind the bars. Remember, the only way to control the negative ‘Causal Effects’ is by controlling your ‘Actions’. The causal effect remains active even after the death of a person. Crooked people go to graves troubled by the injustice done by them to others. </LI>
<LI>The Crooked Bosses must remember: <em>There is no Right way to do a Wrong thing. </em></LI>
<LI>One of the weapons that Crooked Bosses use in their favour is ‘Wrong Propaganda’. They do not realize that most of the crooked fellows become the victim of their own propaganda. </LI>

<P><em>Master Tip to the followers: </em><em>Learn the technique of ‘Selective Support’. When you receive ‘crooked directives’, make an analysis and decide your own ‘Laxman Rekha’ – the extent through which you can carry out the instructions without bleeding your conscience. Beyond this, raise hands and say, “I cannot do this!” It needs competence to declare yourself incompetent in certain matters. You may suffer but you will not sink. Suffering is better than sinking. </em></P>

<H2>8. Gotcha Bosses </H2>
<P>Gotcha is an American slang – Got you! It also means – I understand you. But, ‘Gotcha’ is always used as a negative connotation – I got you - meaning I caught you on the wrong foot! </P>
<P>Many do not know that ‘Gotcha’ is the short form of the game people play in society, popularly known as ‘NIGYSOB’ – Now I’ve got you son of a b…” The last word is so dirty that normally it is not written or spoken. </P>
<P>During my more than three decades of experience in Corporate India, I found many Gotcha Bosses. Nevertheless, the ‘Gotcha’ trend is decreasing. </P>
<P>Those who have seen the popular Hindi film ‘Sholay’ can recall the scene where Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) has captured Basanti (Hema Malini) and tied her to a tree on a hillock. Then the cruel dacoit sends the word to Veeru (Dharmendra) to come and surrender; otherwise, he will kill his beloved Basanti. When Veeru gets the message, he reaches the scene riding a horse. When Veeru came to the valley, Gabbar Singh utters the famous dialogue: “<em>Ab aaya oont pahaad ke neeche</em>!” meaning now the camel has come under the cliff (a situation where he can be easily captured). Gotcha means exactly this. </P>
<P>During my NHPC days, I had a colleague. His name was Thakur. He was an Administrative Manager. He had risen from the ‘rank and file’. Though he was only a Manager, even the Executive Engineers and Superintendent Engineers were afraid of him. No one would ever try to displease Thakur Ji. Why? This was because he was a Gotcha Manager. He knew the art of bringing the camel under the cliff so that it could be easily captured. </P>
<P>The other Gotcha manager – a perfect profile – was Johnny who has been in the limelight in the chapter Heroic Boss. Once he got annoyed with someone, he would not leave him. Normally, subordinates are afraid of bosses. But in Johnny’s case, the bosses were afraid of him. No one would like to take him with them except those who wanted a bull dog to guard themselves against their own weaknesses by using or misusing him. Yet, in one such case, the dog bit the master! </P>
<P>Normally, Gotcha Bosses or Gotcha managers will wait and watch the situation so that they can pounce at the right time and make a perfect kill. Johnny would never do that. He would create the ideal situation so articulately that the camel was bound to come under the cliff. Since he was in corporate HR, he had easy access to the personal files of employees -an extremely confidential document. This way he would get to know every personal detail about the person viz. his horizontal and vertical movements in the company, and the good and bad incidents. After making personal investigations about an employee, he would simply write an anonymous letter levelling some charges against him or her. When the letter reached Corporate Vigilance, Johnny was invited by them as he was the expert. He would ensure that the case finally came to him for he knew how to get the camel under the cliff. </P>
<P>There was a very senior guy, Gopalan (not his real name). Somehow, Johnny had a clash with him on some issue. Johnny challenged him openly by saying, “Mr Gopalan, count your days – I will see to it that you will be out within six months.” Gopalan was General Manager and Johnny was only Manager (Personnel) then. Yet he had the guts to challenge such a senior guy. In that </P>
<P>Gotcha Bosses 123 </P>
<P>company, for getting the subsidised-interest loan for the purchase of a car or scooter, the copy of the registration book of the vehicle was not required – just a simple declaration, supported with some registration number was sufficient. Many used to avail of this onetime subsidised-interest loan by making false declarations. Management always used to keep one eye closed. It was not a corrupt practice though it was a bad practice. Johnny discovered that Mr Gopalan had availed the subsidised-interest loan for the purchase of a car but had actually purchased a scooter, and provided his scooter registration number as the registration number of his car. Everyone knew this but no one regarded it as wrong as many had done the same. Johnny wrote an anonymous letter to CVO (Chief Vigilance Officer) giving the details of this transaction which he had gathered from Gopalan’s personal file. </P>
<P><SPAN>Once the <em>prima facie</em> charges were established, I was asked to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Gopalan. I had gone to the Chairman and pleaded with him arguing that it was not a case of corruption; it was the company’s bad policy which encouraged people to avail of the loan by giving wrong declarations. Then why should only Gopalan be punished? My Chairman understood what I meant. He shared with me the fact that Gopalan had already met him and informed him of the entire episode; about how he was challenged by Johnny in the presence of his lady secretary and a couple of visitors. “But, Siddiqui, I don’t want to get into the problem. I will go with the Vigilance report. I have already endorsed that initiating disciplinary action be taken against him.” To cut the story short, a charge-sheet was issued under the signatures of the Chairman and Managing Director, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Gopalan. Johnny was appointed to represent the case on behalf of the company. It was not difficult to prove the charges established against Gopalan. Gopalan was dismissed. Interestingly, all this happened within six months. The story spread </SPAN>like a wild fire across the company. Johnny established his Gotcha character beyond doubt. </P>
<P>During my workshops, I ask the practicing managers, “When you do something <em>Right</em>, what sort of response do you usually get?” I get the answer, ‘No response’. Then, I ask another question, “When you make a mistake, what sort of response do you usually get?” This time I get a variety of responses about how they were scolded, fired or cautioned by their bosses. The question is, “Why do we catch people doing <em>wrong</em>?” Why do we not catch people when they do something <em>right</em> - something good, something unusual or something miraculous? The reason is that in many organizations you find only Gotcha culture. When we grow in the Gotcha culture organization, we grow from Gotcha managers to Gotcha Bosses. We think that our job is to hold the searchlight to spot someone doing <em>Wrong</em>.</P>
<P> I once asked a manager, “How do you know you are doing good work?” Without taking any time in thinking he retorted, “Simple! When I haven’t been chewed out lately by my boss!” </P>
<P>“Managers seem to throw big searchlights on the misdirected actions,” Ken Blanchard makes a very valued observation in his famous book ‘Whale Done’. Even when you do something good you get yelled at… “Why didn’t you ask me – am I not your boss?” </P>
<P>Learn to catch someone doing things right! Gotcha behaviour of bosses creates tension. Many organizations call management consultants to conduct workshops on ‘Stress Management’ to help their managers deal with work stress. The basic question which many CEOs forget is, ‘Where did the stress come from?” If not always, at least most of the time stress comes from Gotcha managers, Gotcha bosses and Gotcha environment of the organization. First, clean your organization and make it ‘Gotcha Free’. Then call in the </P>
<P>Gotcha Bosses 125 </P>
<P>consultants to conduct the workshops on ‘Stress Management’. This will work. </P>
<P>A few tips </P>
<ul>
<LI>Gotcha creates mistrust in the organization – a few incidents of Gotcha are sufficient to pollute the organization’s culture. </LI>
<LI>Never ever encourage Gotcha Managers. Once you use them for grinding your own axe, they may grind their axes against you not once but many times. </LI>
<LI>Gotcha managers turn into Gotcha bosses and create havoc in the organization. </LI>
<ul>
<LI>Take the ‘Gotcha’ incidents seriously. Identify Gotcha managers and counsel them. Tell them clearly that ‘Gotcha’ does not work in my company. Tell them the consequences </LI>
<LI>– demonstrate your guts, and punish managers for their ‘Gotcha’ approach. </LI>
</ul>
<LI>‘Gotcha’ behaviour is highly infectious as well as contagious. It spreads fast. Take serious precautions to ensure your company does not get infected by such Gotcha managers and Gotcha bosses. </LI>
<LI>Include ‘Gotcha behaviour’ in the list of grave misconducts. </LI>
<LI>Arrange ‘Role Plays’ on ‘Gotcha bosses’ in your training classes. Then, let the group deliberate upon the serious consequences of Gotcha culture. </LI>
</ul>
<P>It is great to have a position of power but do not use it. Like any resource, once you use it, it loses its effect in the course of time. Do not force your people to do things or influence them. Learn to praise your people. Offer praise immediately. Do not confine your praise only to ‘performance’ but also praise their behavioural traits like honesty, truthfulness, caring, trust etc. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> Gotcha is negative. Negativity cannot be countered with another negativity. The only way to counter the negative response is through your positive response. So, accentuate the positive! </em></P>

<H2>9. Micromanaging Bosses </H2>
<P>Picture it! </P>
<P>You have a talented guy who is very competent and committed as well. You have assigned a task to him and given him a deadline. Now, do you let him do his work and simply touch base with him at pre-defined points of time OR do you keep directing him and coercing him by dropping by his desk and sending emails to check his progress? If your style is the latter, then in some way you might be micromanaging the tasks. Micromanaging also mean carrying on with the low-end tasks after attaining a high-end position. </P>
<P>In many cases, micromanagers have perfectly positive attributes </P>
<P>– an attention to detail and a hands-on-approach which they carry to the extreme. There are many reasons for their attitude – either they are ‘control-freaks’ or they do not have confidence in their juniors. In the latter case, they ruin the confidence of their juniors to the point that they might feel it is time to quit. </P>
<P>Micromanagers operate between two nuances – ‘being involved’ or ‘being over-involved’ in the work of their juniors. Being involved is good; being over-involved is akin to micromanaging. </P>
<P>Many go up in the hierarchy, higher and higher, still performing the tasks they were doing when they were three levels lower in the hierarchy. They are micromanagers. When they grow to be the boss, they become ‘Micromanaging Bosses’. </P>
<P>Micromanaging bosses are the victims of their life script. Most of us are the products of our own life script – a story or incident that we encountered during our childhood gets etched in our mind so deeply that this life script dictates our future behavioural pattern. I am providing a sample of a life script. Please read it carefully. </P>
<P>Sparrows and Baby-sparrows </P>
<P>Two sparrows and their babies lived happily in their nest on the top of a tree. Once, when the parent-sparrows returned in the evening, the baby-sparrows anxiously suggested that they leave the tree immediately because they had heard the farmer murmuring, “I will get my friends and cut this tree tomorrow.” </P>
<P>“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the mother sparrow reassuringly to the frightened baby-sparrows. </P>
<P>Next day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer saying, “My friends deceived me – they never turned up. I will ask my son and wife to help me cut this tree tomorrow.” </P>
<P>“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the father-sparrow reassuringly to the frightened baby-sparrows. </P>
<P>On the third day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer grudgingly say, “My own people ditched me. It is better to spend some money and get the work done. I will hire some labourers and cut this tree tomorrow.” </P>
<P>“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the parent-sparrows reassuringly to the terrified baby-sparrows. </P>
<P>On the fourth day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer say, “No one can be depended upon in this world. One has to bear one’s own cross. Tomorrow I will grind my axe to make it sharp and then cut this tree.” </P>
<P>When the baby-sparrows told this to their parents, the parent-sparrows said, “Now the time has come for us to fly away.” Without wasting any time they flew away from the tree. </P>
<P>Imagine that this story is told to you during your childhood, not once but many times, and you register this story in your mind so deeply that it eventually becomes your life script. Can you imagine what pattern of behaviour will you develop based on this story? As a child you will be convinced that nothing will move unless you squarely deal with the situation yourself. In other words, you will grow up with the belief that things will move only when you put your shoulder to the wheel, otherwise nothing can happen. This will dictate a pattern of behaviour where you manage everything by yourself - small and big - as you want to get results. If you grow up with such a behavioural pattern, the chances are very bright that you will turn out to be a micromanager and later a micromanaging boss. </P>
<P>This life script happens to many people. This can also happen owing to ignorance of the fact that when they grow in the hierarchy they should also know their priorities. If a General Manager continues to perform the tasks which he or she was performing as a manager, then he still remains a manager but with a higher designation. He does not deserve to be called General Manager. </P>
<P>Sometimes a manager becomes a micromanager due to his passion for low-end tasks. Creating a good banner on ‘Pages’ may be one of my skills and passion as a Training Officer. I grow to be a Training Manager and continue to design the banners and brochures myself, though others are equally capable of doing this. Then, I reach the coveted position of Vice President (HR).Yet I take pleasure in designing the banners and brochures. Why I am doing so? It is because using ‘Pages’ is my passion. Is it worthy of my position? Certainly not! I am supposed to be doing better things </P>
<P>– high-end tasks. </P>
<P>In one of his articles, Peter Drucker has mentioned that amongst the American Presidents, he found that one of them, who was otherwise a gem of person, suffering from this syndrome of ‘micromanaging’ every task. Can you guess who was this President? It was Jimmy Carter! As per Peter Drucker, Jimmy Carter was a very capable President. He would have contributed more to the nation if he had just given up his ‘micromanaging’ habit. </P>
<P>In a way I am lucky not to have many ‘Micromanaging Bosses’. Beside Mr RA Sharan, whom I have mentioned in the earlier chapter ‘Stone Age Boss’, I also worked with Linganna who used to micromanage the work on the plea of ‘daily business review’. He was Executive Director of the entire business group. Yet, every day he used to visit each SBU (Strategic Business Unit) for a ‘review’. His day used to start from 8 AM and end late at night. He would visit my factory during his last work-shift , at 4 or 5 PM, and continue bulldozing managers till late in the evening. My General Manager and I found no value addition – during the second half of the day, our people used to go barging around obeying his orders and the next morning, during the first half, they devoted their entire time in preparing and collecting production data to save their skin. </P>
<P>Once the production manager shared his heart with me, “Mr Siddiqui, where is the time to concentrate on production – half day we prepare data and the remaining half of the day is spent scampering about to furnish data. You cannot run a company by simply collecting data!” He was right. The Executive Director was more interested in the figures than actual production on the shop floor. After sometime, my managers became smarter. They learnt to ‘Say what pleases the King’s ears!’ </P>
<P>Once, after a meeting, my General Manager and I went down the corridor to see him off at 8.30 PM. After waving hands, we were returning. We heard the loud sound of a honk. The guard came running to us shouting that the ED’s car had returned and that Mr Linganna was calling out for me. I rushed. I thought there must be some important message that had made my Executive Director to take a ‘U’ turn. When I reached his car, I saw Linganna leaning out from the rear window and waving his (dirty) pair of socks. I could not understand what he was doing. Then he laughed and said, “Siddiqui, see… I do not have time even to wear my socks. In the morning, my wife gave these socks to me to wear; it is now night and I still couldn’t find time to wear them. Be my witness. I am putting them on now!” We both once again waved our hands to him and his car zoomed off. </P>
<P>“What a pity!” I thought. “How can this guy manage three factories under his charge when he cannot even manage his time to wear a pair of socks!!” I remembered how once Lee Iacocca had sacked one of the CEOs of his company. Can you guess what was the fault of the CEO? When Lee Iacocca visited the particular factory for the first time, after taking charge as the Chairman of the company, he asked the CEO, “When did you last go on a vacation with your family?” The CEO replied, “Sir, I don’t have time for such luxury. For the last three years I have not taken leave for a single day – no question of my going on vacation with the family.” Lee Iacocca smiled and said, “You are fired – now go and have a nice time with your family.” Then he clarified, “I don’t want guys who do not know how to manage their holidays to head my business. Those who cannot manage their personal time cannot manage the business.” Though this sounds a bit harsh, he was right. </P>
<P>The CEOs are paid a fat salary not for deciding the menu and venues for corporate dinners. Micromanaging is an unpardonable sin that many corporate Pharaohs commit without any feeling of guilt. </P>
<P>Here are some tips to identify the micromanaging bosses: </P>
<ul>
<LI>They resist ‘delegation’, let alone empowering their people. </LI>
<LI>They immerse themselves in ‘overseeing’ the projects of their juniors even though the guys are capable. </LI>
<LI>They are fault-finders always looking for some minor mistakes to correct instead of looking at the big picture. </LI>
<LI>They take back the powers delegated to the juniors if they find even one minor or negligible mistake. </LI>
<LI>They discourage their juniors from making decisions without consulting them. </LI>
</ul>
<P>When a boss is reluctant to delegate work, focuses on details instead of the big picture and discourages his staff from taking the initiative, there is every chance that he is sliding towards micromanaging the work. Be alert and try out some of the following suggestions as a remedial measure for such bosses! </P>
<P>Some Tips for managing micromanaging bosses: If you are micromanaged by your boss, help him discover that there are many other ways to get better results. Make him focus on his ‘delegation’ skills and learn to trust his people to develop and deliver. </P>
<ol>
<LI>Win the confidence of your boss by demonstrating your competence so that he starts trusting you though initially it will be shakily. </LI>
<LI>Come forward and volunteer to take on some projects that you are confident you can handle. </LI>
<LI>Make sure that you communicate the progress in the project regularly to discourage him from seeking information. Before he asks, you must provide the data and update him of the progress so that he does not feel the need to micromanage your work. </LI>
<LI>Concentrate on helping your boss to change one ‘micromanaging habit’ at a time. Remember how addicts are cured. They are not cured with a sudden withdrawal of the drugs. The process of withdrawal is quite slow. You cannot eat an elephant in a single gulp. But you can eat the entire elephant if you cut him in pieces and eat the pieces, one by one. </LI>
</ol>
<P>The CEO (Chief Executive Officer) should not reduce himself to the position of COE (Chief Operating Executive). Many do not have this simple wisdom. </P>

<H2>10. Abdicating Bosses </H2>
<P>‘Abdication’ is the 180 degrees opposite of ‘Micromanagement’. </P>
<P>During my assignment in NHPC (National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation) I had another colleague Mr Singh (besides Thakur). He was from Bihar. Both of us were working there as Deputy Manager Personnel. We both were assisting our chief boss, the Chief Engineer, who was the project chief of the Baira Siul Hydroelectric Project. The workload was evenly divided between the two of us.</P>
<P> I used to go early to work and sit late in the evenings; yet I was not able to cope up with workload. However, my colleague, Singh, used to finish his entire work by noon and come to me only to see that I was still sweating it out trying to cope up with the workload. </P>
<P>“Siddiqui Ji, you are always busy. Leave your work for a while. Let us have a good chat.” </P>
<P>“What about you?” I would ask enviously and sometimes even jealously when I saw him in such a casual mood while I was drowning in the sea of the unmanageable workload. </P>
<P>“I have already finished my job… will you not get me a cup of coffee?” he would ask. I would force myself to take a few </P>
<P>minutes off, waiting impatiently for Singh to go so that I could get back to my routine. </P>
<P>When this happened many times, I became eager to know his managing technique. How could he finish the entire task just in a few hours, whereas I used to sweat it out the entire day? I decided to find out the secret of his efficient way of managing the task. Sudesh, who was earlier working in my team, was recently transferred to Singh. I thought of calling him secretly to find out the secret of Singh’s ‘excellent’ managing techniques. </P>
<P>Sudesh came to me but disappointed me by saying, “Siddiqui Sir, you cannot do what Mr Singh can do!” </P>
<P>“Do you mean I am so incapable that I can’t even copy Mr Singh’s managing practices?” I asked. </P>
<P>“Sir, you may feel bad,” Sudesh told me, “ But, believe me, <em>you</em> cannot do what Mr Singh does.” He repeated the sentence. Then he shared Mr Singh’s secret techniques in these words: </P>
<P><SPAN>“When I go to Mr Singh carrying a big load of files, he asks me to give them to him, one by one. When I give a file to him he asks me in Bihari Hindi, “<em>Yeh kaa hai</em>? (What is this?) So, I explain the entire case. If I am not able to explain he asks me to go back and come back to him after understanding the file details clearly. After I explain the entire case, he asks the second question, “<em>Hum ko kaa karna hai</em>?” (What I am supposed to do?) So I then suggest what he is supposed to do. If I am not able to suggest anything, he will ask me how I had solved such an issue in yester years. Then I </SPAN><SPAN>explain to him what we did earlier in such a similar situation. On hearing this he will say, <em>“Waisa hi kar do</em>” ( do likewise). This way, using only these three sentences - (1) <em>Yeh kaa hai </em>(What is this) (2) <em>Hum ko kaa karna hai</em>? (What I am supposed to do?) and finally </SPAN></P>
<P>(3) <em>Waisa hi kar do</em> (Do likewise) - he completes his entire task in one hour and like a donkey I work late into the night to complete the task. He does not even ask me if the tasks were completed or how I completed those tasks! It is none of his concern.” </P>
<P>“You are right. I cannot do this!” I confessed and both of us had a hearty laugh. </P>
<P>Like <em>Micromanagement</em>, <em>Abdication</em> is a great corporate sin. These are two opposite extremes. Truth lies somewhere at the middle. </P>
<P>A few tips </P>
<P>Abdication is not Empowerment. In Empowerment, first you judge the capabilities of your people – their competence and commitment. You are supposed to empower only when both are positive. If a person is weak in competence, he needs training and coaching. If a person is negative in commitment, he needs counselling to improve his attitude and behaviour. If a person is weak, both in competence and commitment, you have no other option than to control. Once you find your guy is fully competent and totally committed, close your eyes and ‘Empower’ him. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip: </em><em>Abdication is not Empowerment, though in both cases you let your people free to handle the situations. In Abdication you shift the buck; in Empowerment you create trust and confidence. </em></P>

<H2>11. Mohammad Tughlaq Bosses </H2>
<P>Mohammad Bin Tughlaq is one of the victims of historians. He has been so wrongly portrayed that the connotation ‘Mohammad Tughlaq’ is used as a synonym for foolish and crazy fellows. He was one of the brilliant Kings of the Moghul Empire in India – a man capable of designing the best political strategies. He failed in implementation owing to his anxiety for speedy results. To my mind, he was born before his time. Had he been born in today’s era, where speed is the only Goddess of Worship, he would have proved that he was one of the best strategists. </P>
<P>PC Neogi was one such mistaken genius. He was highly intelligent, a voracious reader and a man of knowledge. When he joined our company as the Chairman and Managing Director, many (including myself) went back to the basics to get a face-lift. </P>
<P>PC Neogi was a genius who always spoke ahead of his time. He was a very energetic person bubbling with enthusiasm – honest to the core. Many people could not match their pace with his speed. He wanted his people to fly but most of them were behaving like a herd of clumsy buffaloes. When you do not understand the lofty thoughts of a genius you start making fun of him. This is why his people gave him the nickname ‘Mohammad Tughlaq’. </P>
<P>Those were days when I was given the assignment by my new CEO to create a ‘Learning Organization’. Once he was taking a flight to Delhi and sent a book to me from the airport because he thought it would make useful reading for an HRD-ian. It was Peter F Drucker’s ‘Managing for the Future’. It was neither the fame of the author nor the text of the book that moved me. It was the ‘highly thoughtful’ gesture of the CEO who sent a book from the airport to an HR person. That gesture deeply touched my soul. </P>
<P>At home, later, I stood before a mirror – and I found in my image a person covered with the dust of obsolescence. I rolled up my sleeves and decided to get back to the basics of what HRD is all about! Wisdom dawned on me: <em>in the era of nanoseconds I am required to increase my pace. </em>It is a matter of survival. And creating a true learning organization is the only remedy. </P>
<P>I learnt many things from this Mohammad Tughlaq boss. Learning is breathing in; creativity is breathing out. Those who breathe in are the ones who can breathe out. Such a simple HRD equation but many people do not understand it. </P>
<P>Again, the ability to learn depends on the learning horizon. For some, learning is space-less and for some, learning is endless – creativity becomes their staple food. </P>
<P>My CEO always remained an inquisitive learner. He often used to say, “Recharge yourself from the books and learn from everyone and from every incident. Begin your job afresh everyday.” He was very fond of quoting Swami Vivekananda: <em>Every soul is potentially divine! </em></P>
<P>He untiringly persuaded his people to use the right side of their brain. “The brain is brilliantly uncreative in the sense that it will use the same pattern again and again under all circumstances,” he once explained to me by borrowing the words of Edward de Bono. “Creativity comes from meditation” was his unshaken faith and ‘Management by Meditation’ was his steadfast religion. </P>
<P>It took me months to follow the flight of his thoughts. What he perhaps meant was, ‘First shape the idea softly, then bake it to harden it with practice.’ Obviously, one needs to go through two phases – imaginative phase and practical phase. I caught the catch phrase: Think of something different to get something original done. </P>
<P>“Why can’t you make the tractor bonnets out of wood!” he would suggest to an R&amp;D guy, only to see people around laugh up their sleeves. In another meeting he said, “I want slim watches; take a hacksaw and slice these shoddy fat watches.” He suggested this to one of our watch designers in a unit located at a far-flung place. The echo of the soundless laughter of those around him reached me at the corporate office. This still vibrates my eardrums. I still shudder at their ignorance for they did not know the type of thinking pattern the genius was trying to teach them. </P>
<P>And a day came when he gave a smacking whack on the right side of my head. I had gone to get his approval for campus recruitment to cover the shortage of HRD officers caused by an unprecedented exodus owing to market demand in the private sector. When I submitted the proposal in writing, he just wrote down “Create HRD out of mud”. Reading my face carefully, he pointed his finger towards a beautiful painting of a potter who was training his daughter how to make pottery out of soft clay. The inscription below captured my eyes – A Potter and the Clay. </P>
<P>I did not ask a single question as I had understood what he meant. Instead of recruiting new guys he wanted me to develop the skills of the existing people who were not gainfully utilized. </P>
<P>“Don’t look elsewhere to see what everyone is doing – think for yourself and do it,” he said with a pleasant smile and returned the file to me. </P>
<P>Tips for Mohammad Tughlaq Bosses: </P>
<ol>
<LI>They must understand that they have been born ahead of their time but this not true for everyone. Many good movies fail not because they were bad; they fail because the moviegoers have not attained the maturity to understand them. Likewise, many management strategies fail, not because of their weakness but for they being ahead of their time. </LI>

<H2>12. Baba-Yaga Bosses </H2>
<P>Who was this ‘Baba-Yaga’? To know about ‘Baba-Yaga’ Bosses, you must know who was ‘Baba-Yaga’! Before I tell you about Baba-Yaga, let me share a story about the stern mother-in-law. </P>
<P>In a village, a very stern mother-in-law headed a joint family. Her daughter-in-law was being inducted gradually into the family traditions. The young girl often observed the austere and stingy nature of her mother-in-law. In the village, beggars would visit the households on specific days for alms. The young daughter-in-law had seen her motherin-law shoo away the beggars every time they came to their house. </P>
<P>Once, a beggar came to the doorstep when the daughter-in-law was around. As per the ‘family tradition’, she asked him to leave. </P>
<P>Just then her mother-in-law appeared on the scene and admonished the daughter-in-law, “Why did you drive away the beggar?” Surprised at the change of heart in the mother-in-law, the young girl offered to call back the beggar. The beggar expectantly scurried back to the front door. </P>
<P>The old lady thundered, “Scoot off, you bandicoot! Of course, you are not getting any alms from this household!” </P>
<P>Thereafter, she updated the young girl on the theoretical aspects of her peculiar behaviour. “Don’t dare use the power not handed down to you.” </P>
<P>This beautiful story tells us all about ‘Patriarchy’ – an antithesis to ‘Empowerment’. Patriarchal bosses manage through ‘Command’ and ‘Control’ I call them ‘Stern Mother-in-Law Bosses’. During my active corporate life of over three decades I found such ‘Stern Mother-in-Laws’ everywhere. They exist in the manufacturing industry; they exist in the mining industry; they exist in the IT industry; they exist in the Service and Hospitality industry and they also exist in many Management Institutions. They have a very commanding personality and are highly ‘Power Conscious’. </P>
<P>During my sessions when I ask, “Do you have any such ‘Stern Mother-in-Laws’ in your organization?’, I do not get an immediate reply. I enjoy watching their furtive smiles which proclaim to me, “How can I say ‘Yes’?” Then I assure them that my question is purely for an academic purpose and their whispers will not reach the ears of the bosses. Only then do one or two delegates muster up courage and share some of their pathetic experiences with their Stern Mother-in-Law type of bosses. </P>
<P>When I was reading a Russian Fairy Tale of ‘Baba-Yaga’, I found this term ‘Baba-Yaga’ explains ‘Patriarchal’ characteristics much better than the terminology ‘Stern Mother-in-Law’. Whereas the ‘Stern Mother-in-Law’ character can be best understood by Indian managers, the ‘Baba-Yaga’ character has global acceptability. </P>
<P>Now I will explain who was Baba-Yaga’! Let me narrate briefly the famous Russian Fairy Tale – ‘Baba-Yaga – the Cannibal Witch’! </P>
<P>Long, long ago, in a certain Tsardom, there lived a beautiful girl – Vasilisa. She had a little wise doll which was her true foul-weather companion. </P>
<P>Once, Vasilisa was caught by Baba-Yaga, the cunning and sly witch who gobbled up people in the wink of an eye. The cruel witch lived in a huge castle. The fence around the castle was made of human bones and crowned with human skulls. The gate was not a wooden gate but was made from the bones of men’s legs; the bolts were not iron bolts but were made up of the bones of men’s arms, and the lock was not an iron lock but a lock made from a set of sharp teeth. Baba-Yaga had her own obedient and faithful force – all dreaded creatures, viz. a black-browed maid, a birch-tree, a wild ferocious dog, a wicked gate, and an old Grumbler-Rumbler, the cat. All were groomed to obey her and follow her commands blindly. </P>
<P>Night descended, and many of the eyes of the skulls crowning the fence began to glow and brought light making the night look like the day. </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga returned in the evening. The Earth trembled and rocked beneath Vasilisa’s feet. There was Baba-Yaga flying up in a mortar, swinging her pestle like a whip and sweeping the tracks away with a broom. Vasilisa got frightened but did not lose heart. She decided to face Baba-Yaga boldly. </P>
<P>The cruel witch was very hungry and wanted to eat Vasilisa. She ordered, “Light the stove, black-browed maid, and make the fire hot. When I wake up, I shall roast Vasilisa!” </P>
<P>And Baba-Yaga lay down on a bench, placed her chin on a shelf, covered herself with her foot and began to snore so loudly that the whole forest trembled and shook. </P>
<P>Vasilisa mustered up courage. She consulted her wise doll for advice. The doll whispered something in her ears. </P>
<P>Vasilisa rushed to the black-browed maid and bowed low to her. “Please, black-browed maid, help me!”, she cried, “When you are lighting the stove, pour water over the wood so it does not burn the way it should.” Vasilisa then approached every creature and politely requested them to help her. They expressed their sympathy but were unwilling to help her for their own safety. Vasilisa told them that they were all really powerful creatures. The strength of Baba-Yaga was not really her’s alone but lay in them. They should help her only of they were convinced about this. Once they withdrew their support, Baba-Yaga’s magic castle would collapse like a house of cards. </P>
<P>The black-browed maid and other blind followers of the cruel witch were caught in a dilemma – whether to follow helplessly and unwillingly the dictatorial commands of their dreadful master, the barbarous witch, or to accept the polite request of the little honest girl! </P>
<P>‘Were they really more powerful than their master?’ This strange and chaste thought softy tingled their minds. </P>
<P>There was a lull, a moment filled with the mystery and suspense of a ghostly graveyard. </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga woke up and stretched her arms. Seeing that Vasilisa was gone, she rushed out into the passage and shouted out in anger. </P>
<P>“Did you stretch Vasilisa as she ran, Grumbler-Rumbler?” she demanded to know. </P>
<P>And the cat replied coolly. “No, I let her pass for she was polite to me. I served you for ten years, Baba-Yaga, but you never gave me any love or affection.” </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga rushed out into the yard. “Did you bite Vasilisa, my faithful dog?” she demanded to know. </P>
<P>“No, I let her pass for she gave me respect. I served you for ever so many years but you always ill-treated me.” </P>
<P>“Birch-tree!” Baba- Yaga roared in anger, “Did you pull out Vasilisa’s eyes?” </P>
<P>Said the Birch-tree in reply, “No, I let her pass for she bound me with her love and affection. I have been growing here for ten years and you have never even treated me decently!” </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga ran to the gate. “Gate, gate!” she cried, “Did you shut yourself so that Vasilisa could not pass through you?” </P>
<P>“No, I let her pass for she greased my hinges and served my long felt need. I served you for ever so long but you never even put water on them”, replied the gate. </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga flew into a temper. She began to beat the dog, thrash the cat, break down the gate and chop down the birch-tree. Soon she felt so tired that she forgot all about Vasilisa. The beautiful wise girl, who was still hiding in the castle, stealthily slipped out and ran away as fast as she could. On the way she heard a loud sound as though the Earth had been badly shaken. She turned around only to see a blazing castle. The powerful structure was collapsing like a house of cards. All the strange creatures were walking out confidently and safely. Baba-Yaga was nowhere in sight. Perhaps, she had been caught in the fire and was now buried under the debris of her castle. </P>
<P>I have discerned in this fairy-tale all the elements that exist in a patriarchal environment. The tale carries a strong message for bosses that by not supporting your juniors, you cannot achieve your objectives. By following the rules laid down by a patriarchal system, all the Vasilisas– the high-fliers and achievers - would be lost within the insensitive Baba-Yagas’ patriarchal system and power centres. </P>
<P>Even your subordinates will withdraw their support once they are convinced that their efforts are not benefiting the company. </P>
<P>Employees are like shareholders in a company. When the shareholders withdraw their share, the company faces a financial turmoil. However, withdrawal of the employees’ share - comprising of sincere contribution, commitment and whole-hearted cooperation - is not visible to those who do not see the ‘invisible’. </P>
<P>Like a shareholder, an employee too invests his capacity, ability and emotions in a company. Again, like a shareholder, he seeks returns. He expects a fair return for the work he does, as well as a continually growing career. Since he has made an emotional investment in the company, he also expects a fair deal and fair treatment. An employee, like a shareholder, is capable of moving away from his commitment. “This movement may be a reduction in his commitment. Unless the employee sees some satisfaction in what he is doing and receives respect in return for his service, the commitment will not be made,” observes Albert Low in Zen and Creative Management. The Baba-Yagas in today’s business can ill-afford the luxury of discounting this fact. They cannot take the loyalties, the commitment and the sincere services of black-browed maids and birch trees and Grumbler-Rumbler for granted anymore. </P>
<P>The Baba-Yaga of the Russian fairy-tale characterizes a typical patriarchal boss who gives precedence to self-interest and self-esteem over the company’s objectives. A halo of egotism always crowns his head. His actions aim at building his own image and gaining personal mileage out of the employees’ work. “We want to be promoted,” writes Peter Block,” to have more responsibility, to have control over more people; in other words, the more power we have, the better off we are.” </P>
<P>The taste of power to most of us is like the taste of the roasted flesh of Vasilisa to Baba-Yaga. A cannibal tends to appreciate the beauty of a little girl only in terms of the weight of her flesh and bones – beauty is of no concern to him. A patriarchal boss, likewise, tends to seek ego-seduction – productivity and company’s objectives are secondary. Even the high-fliers are not spared in the anxiety of monitoring and persuasion. “It is like whipping a horse that’s already running as fast as it can” write Eli Goldratt and Jeff Cox in ‘The Goal’. Obviously, some of these fast-running horses fall and get injured when they are harshly whipped. While turning around a company or managing a change, a CEO must always remember what Abraham Lincoln once said, “It is best not to swap horses while crossing the river.” Managing change is far more difficult than crossing a river in flood. The high-fliers need extra care at such an hour of test and trail. </P>
<P>The huge castle of Baba-Yaga, the fence around it - made of human bones and crowned with human skulls - symbolizes the power centres in a patriarchal work environment where managers always hear an unspoken command that permission of their superiors is a must; even before inhaling. They are made aware that the Baba-Yagas have super powers, and can ‘blow out their candle without even taking a deep breath’. </P>
<P>The reign of fear and phobia snuffs out creativity, ingenuity and intuitive reflexes. Everyone would like to play a safe-game lest Baba-Yaga shower upon them her wrath and curses. In such a work culture, status-quo pays off and the risk-taking urge rests in deep slumber. The more height we gain, the more we look for safety. The desire ‘to hold on to what we already have’ will increase as we climb up the ladder of hierarchy. The greater the tragic fall, the greater will be the desire to restore the status-quo. </P>
<P>Stern Corporate Mother-in-Laws and Baba-Yaga bosses must understand that Empowerment is a vital management philosophy which motivates and inspires people. It is easier to preach than practise. However, it is a grossly misconceived myopic approach to regard it as being actually simple delegation of work. The formal delegation of authority is a bureaucratic tool which is contaminated and dust-laden. Those who want to empower their people only through delegation of power still seem to be standing on their heads. If they stand back on their feet and have a fresh look at the pyramid, they will see that the pyramid gets inverted. An inverted flattened pyramid can more appropriately be assigned to the philosophy of Empowerment. Empowerment is the antithesis of Patriarchy. </P>
<P>‘Share power, don’t give it away’ is the key tenet of Empowerment. There are two kinds of power – <em>visionary</em> power and <em>operational</em> power. However, it is the latter type of power which should be shared. The visionary power must lie with the CEO who shapes corporate vision and gives it a sense of direction. This power can be shared with others only on a limited basis so as to get a variety of ideas to hone up and perfect the CEO’s corporate vision. </P>
<P>Visionary bosses not only help their people to climb up the ladder but also ensure that the ladder is leaning against the right wall. “Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning to the right wall.” says Dr Stephen Covey. Empowerment given to one’s people without showing them the right direction does zero good. <em>Vision </em>should precede <em>Empowerment</em>. </P>
<P>Baba-Yaga bosses must realize that Empowerment is a movement rather than a concept. It will launch a sustained assault on the patriarchal approach which has been dominating our thoughts right from our school days. Empowerment is not a slogan for preaching. It is an emotion-filled mission, designed to destroy the power centres and to demolish the tall pyramids. “For management, empowerment is the giving up of some control and sharing of additional knowledge of company goals and achievements,” says Marcia Lewis, Principal, Lewis Bruke Consulting Group. For employees, it is the acceptance of risk by taking more responsibility. Both must be prepared to define objectives in terms of business goals. In the entrepreneurial interest, management must allow employees to play an important role in the day-to-day company affairs. </P>
<P>The patriarchal strategies of Baba-Yaga lie in a systematic well-drawn plan and the clearly communicated orders to the blackbrowed maid to light the stove and make the flame very hot and roast Vasilisa to satiate the gourmet’s taste. They are designed to achieve personal gains in the name of organizational objectives. Obviously, the patriarchal boss resorts to these strategies to get the roasted dish of Vasilisa’s tender flesh cooked by his faithful blackbrowed maids for his exclusive consumption. They forget the simple fact – you can see the real picture only when you take your ‘You’ out of it. </P>
<P>The harsh treatment meted out by Baba-Yaga to her own loyal and obedient servant, and animals is not merely a simple diabolic characterization of the cruel witch. It is a business piece of metaphor to paint and highlight the patriarchal approach of Baba-Yaga. The Patriarchal Bosses can learn many things from this simple story of the cannibal witch. </P>
<P>“Do what I say; if you don’t obey, not only your career growth but your very existence in the company will be in danger.” Such unspoken signals are given to the subordinates by the simple blink of an eye or raised eyebrows of the patriarchal bosses. </P>
<P>Eventually, Baba-Yaga loses Vasilisa – the prime objective of her entire strategic mission! This happens because Baba-Yaga’s concentration shifts from Vasilisa to meting out harsh treatment to her own once-upon-a-time faithful and obedient work-force. When the ego of a patriarchal boss is hurt, he loses sight of his objective. He begins to beat his dogs and to thrash his cats, to break down the gates and to chop down the birch trees. And ultimately he gets so tired that he forgets all about the Vasilisas– the organizational objectives or its vision – the purpose of its very existence! </P>
<P>In sharp contrast to the patriarchal approach of Baba-Yaga, the beautiful Vasilisa adopts a policy of involvement and honest communication. She creates awareness in the entranced creatures of the patriarchal power centre. She infuses in them the spirit of intellectual integrity which eventually results in an collective assault on the patriarchal system leading to its total collapse. </P>
<P>Boldness is the key to success. The central tenet of Empowerment is boldness. The eventual independence of the Indian nation too rests on the ‘truth’ of Empowerment without ‘violence’. </P>
<P>Knowledge, skill, potential, commitment and competence – these positive traits and qualities are the essential prerequisites of an empowered environment where the brave new manager will begin his work. The wise doll of Vasilisa’s epitomises these traits in the fairy tale. Vasilisa’s humility and the doll’s wisdom provide a cross-functional approach to the strategic plan leading to her wonderful escape. </P>
<P>The most significant aspect of the fairy-tale is perhaps the favourable situation created by the wise and beautiful little girl. The non-transparent and dreadful environment had made the creatures spineless. They were caught in the myth that if they stood up and spoke against Baba-Yaga, the cruel witch would finish them off. But once their spines were straightened and their hearts filled with courage, they stand up and face the challenges boldly. They demolish the entire power centre and manage to come out of the inferno alive (with minor bruises here and there). </P>
<P>Here is a bold suggestion from Peter Block to face the Baba-Yaga bosses. “If people in power above do not like what I am doing, let them stop me. Better to be seen as stubborn than incompetent,” says Peter Block. “There is quiet revolution taking place in many organizations. It is time managers must know leaning is important </P>
<P>– the direction in which they lean.” </P>
<P>M R Kopmeyer, an American success counsellor, spontaneously comes up with the answer. “Always lean into the storm of life. Lean toward danger – never away from it.” We should acquire boldness to get along with such power-hungry and power-sucker bosses. </P>
<P>A manager’s leanings determine his real managerial personality. It brands him. His people, juniors as well as seniors, assess him accordingly and know what to expect. “Don’t fall out of fear. Once anyone falls, everybody pushes the falling fence,” says a Chinese sage. One must learn to empower oneself if Empowerment does not come to him by grace. </P>
<P>Tips to get along with Baba-Yaga bosses </P>
<ul>
<LI>Be bold. </LI>
<LI>‘Boldness in business is the first, second and third thing.’ </LI>
<LI>Boldness does not mean a trial of muscle power. There is </LI>
</ul>
<P>a distinct difference between stretching the risk-muscles and flexing the power-muscles. The former is good; the latter is bad. </P>
<ul>
<LI>Do not make a vulgar display of egotism. If you do, you must know that you are suffering from a disease called egomania which stems from an inferiority complex. </LI>
<LI>Remember – ‘He who doesn’t lose his wits over certain things has no wits to lose’. </LI>
<LI>‘Empower yourself, if others cannot.’ </LI>
<LI>Use your assertive rights – never complain, never explain. </LI>
<LI>Choose autonomy over dependency – learn to be unstoppable. </LI>
<LI>It is better to err than not to perform – managers can also be moulded out of faults. </LI>
<LI>Show courage rather than embrace caution with the fear of falling from the ladder of hierarchy. Only weak people fall, the fearless managers know how to climb higher and higher amidst all odds. </LI>
<LI>Do not forget that ‘People at the bottom have more power than they realize and people at the top have less power than that attributed to them’. </LI>
<LI>Ignorance is not bliss – it is oblivion. Wisdom comes to those who are aware of their ignorance. </LI>
<LI>Your job ‘is not to reform the boss, not to re-educate the boss, not to make the boss conform to what the business schools and the management books say about what bosses should be like’. </LI>
<LI>Defer no time; delays have dangerous ends. </LI>
<LI>If you are on the look for security, do not forget – your boss too needs his own security blanket. </LI>
<LI>‘He that will not sail till all dangers are over must never be put to sea.’ If you do not want to take any risk, better not remain within the arena of entrepreneurship. </LI>
<LI>Study carefully - What are the things the boss does well? What are his strengths? And what are the boss’s limitations and weaknesses – the areas in which the subordinate needs to support, to buttress and to supplement the boss? A manager’s task is to make the strength of his people effective and their weaknesses irrelevant. </LI>
<LI>Never underrate the boss! The boss may look illiterate, he may look ignorant – looks are at times deceptive. The lesson, ‘Don’t discount others’ applies to bosses as well. </LI>
<LI>Do not behave larger than life-size. A heroic manager is as bad a parasite as is a low performer – both contribute to the decadence of an organization. </LI>
<LI>Make sure the boss understands what can be expected of you, the objectives and goals on which your own energies and those of your people will be concentrated upon, what your priorities are and equally important, what they are not. </LI>
<LI>The first person on whom a manager’s performance depends upon is the ‘boss’ and the boss is, therefore, the first person for whose performance a manager has to take responsibility… Can you find out what the boss needs </LI>
</ul>
<P>and what gets in the boss’s way? This does not mean one must succumb to the patriarchal urges of one’s boss. ‘Sobriety’ is a prerequisite to ‘courage’ – maintain distance between ‘courage’ and ‘aggression.’ You are not supposed to be aggressive with your boss. </P>
<ul>
<LI>Never ever become a ‘Chocolate-cream soldier’ – a soldier who has never seen action in battle. Battle on courageously. Fighting against patriarchy is a holy war. </LI>
<LI>Managers should not forget ‘the real risk is in doing nothing.’ </LI>
<LI>Never play too safe. ‘The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions’. </LI>
<LI>Remember - ‘He that is too secure is not safe’. </LI>
</ul>
<P>A coward dies every day – a person with courage dies only once. If death becomes imminent, it should be faced with grace and courage. It is always better to die once rather than see the lurking shadows of death every day. In terms of employment, death is synonymous with being fired or sacked. It is better to be fired for demonstrating your spine by showing courage with sobriety, rather than falling due to spineless inaction or incompetence. ‘If anything can go wrong, it will’. Someone may face the situation boldly, others may raise their hands in total surrender. If the choice is between risk-taking and escapism – choose the former. But ‘the goal is to take reasonable risks, not to commit suicide’. </P>
<P>Remember, courage and aggression are not synonymous – sobriety contrasts arrogance. Arrogance should always be unwelcome, even if it be the arrogance of intelligence. “Whenever we talk about courage, our minds turn to fantasies of either homicide or suicide,” observes Peter Block. “All we are fighting is bureaucracy, we are not reclaiming the Northwest Territory for our homeland.” </P>
<P>The key to success of any manager lies in the four Cs – Competence, Commitment, Courage and Courtesy (Sobriety). </P>
<P>Vasilisa’s courage was neither filled with arrogance nor with aggression. She demonstrated her spine, maintaining sobriety. Her wisdom was her courage and involving others was her strength. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of the fairy-tale is the situation created by the wise little girl – once the entranced creatures of the witch, who had totally surrendered their existence to her, were empowered by Vasilisa, Baba-Yaga could not scare them. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip:</em><em> Managers are more powerful than those at the ‘top. Many do not know this fact. When they realize this, the Baba-Yagas do not scare them. </em></P>

<H2>13. Pygmalion Bosses </H2>
<P>The Pygmalion bosses are very caring and very loving but keep the bar of expectation from their people quite high. </P>
<P>Who are the Pygmalion Bosses? For this, first we must know who was ‘Pygmalion’! </P>
<P>In Greek mythology, Pygmalion was a passionate sculptor. He was the King of Cyprus. </P>
<P>For some reason, Pygmalion avoided women. In fact, he vowed never to marry. Pygmalion used his wonderful skills to make a statue of a woman in ivory. It was so beautiful that no living woman could match its beauty. He gave it the name Galatea. Pygmalion fell in love with his own creation. During the festival of worship for Goddess Aphrodite, Pygmalion fervently beseeched the Goddess to grant life to the lifeless Galatea, his true love. His prayers were so passionate that Aphrodite accepted his prayers and breathed life into the statue. Galatea became a real, beautiful woman. Pygmalion married her and both lived happily ever after. </P>
<P>‘Pygmalion Effect’ has become a management metaphor – You get what you expect! Management mavens believe that expectations determine the outcome, not sometimes, always! Many experiments were conducted and it was proved that ‘expectations’ get the matching results. If the boss expects less, people perform less. But if the boss’s expectations are high, people try their best to raise their performance to match their boss’s expectations. The following are the central tenets of the Pygmalion Effect: </P>
<ol>
<LI>What the boss expects from his subordinates and the way he treats them largely determines the subordinates’ performance and career progress. </LI>
<LI>A unique characteristic of a superior boss is the ability to create ‘high performance expectations’ that subordinates fulfil. </LI>
<LI>Less effective boss fails to develop high expectations and as a consequence of this, the productivity and output of his subordinates suffer. </LI>
<LI>Subordinates, like soldiers, more often than not, appear to do what they believe their boss expects them to do. </LI>
<LI>The first boss matters. If the first boss is a ‘Pygmalion’ boss, people grow with a loving heart, and they grow up to be Pygmalion bosses. But if the first boss is a Gotcha boss, the subordinates also grow to be Gotcha bosses. Lucky are those who begin their career with Pygmalion bosses; unlucky are those who start their career with Gotcha bosses. </LI>
</ol>
<P>I am lucky to have had many Pygmalion Bosses. </P>
<P>AS Chatrath, the Chief Engineer of Baira Siul Project during my NHPC assignment, was a person who assessed my potential. He knew my capabilities which I never thought I possessed. His expectations were so high that many a time I became nervous and thought that ‘this time I will fail’. But he motivated the energy in me in his own way and I used this energy to fly to the height he wanted me to reach. What I am today, I owe it to AS Chatrath – the Pied-piper! He was a tough and demanding boss. </P>
<P>My second Pygmalion boss was HR Alva, Director HR, HMT. He never gave me an order or instructions. He just used to whisper what he was expecting from me. He was highly supportive and caring. I do not remember ever disappointing him. Like Pygmalion, he expected to get only the best. Like Galatea, I had to be at my best. Unlike AS Chatrath, HR Alva was very soft but highly demanding. Both had their own individual styles of expecting and getting the best from me. </P>
<P>My third Pygmalion boss was N Ramanuja, Chairman and Managing Director of HMT. He was a born Pygmalion – a very transparent boss. He had high levels of energy and a very loving heart. Although he was the Chairman, and I was only a General Manager (HR), he never treated me as his subordinate. He never called me Siddiqui or Mr Siddiqui. He always used to call me ‘Siddiqui Saheb’. Even today, whenever I meet him or have a chat with him over the phone, he always begins with, ‘Siddiqui Saheb, how are you?’ Unlike both AS Chatrath and HR Alva, he was neither hard nor soft nor demanding; he would just tell you what he expects and stand beside you like a rock to give his full support. No wonder I have never disappointed him. </P>
<P>Among my Pygmalion bosses, I would also include MK Jaura's name. When for the first time I was given the corporate assignment to manage HR at the macro-level in a premier public sector organization, my boss, MK Jaura, gave me two tips: (1) Never do backseat driving (2) Give credit to your people. In the first day sermon he said, “All through your career you have learnt to face and tackle the problems directly. One way to look at it is like steering the car while sitting in the driver’s seat. But now you are in the corporate office. Remember, there can’t be two persons in the driver’s seat. It is time for you to take the back seat and allow the driver to steer.” He further added, “Your job is to keep your expectations from your SBU people high; share your expectations with them. Keep their morale high and you will see that they live up to what you expected from them.” At that point of time, I did not understand his words. Today, as the author of the popular book, ‘The Pygmalion Manager’ and a course-Director of a 3-day workshop on the same theme, I understand the power of expectations. We tend to opt for backseat driving for we do not trust the guy sitting in the driver’s seat. Our job is to honestly share our expectations and allow the person to drive the car using his or her own driving skills. </P>
<P>The other lesson that I learnt from MK Jaura was how to grant ‘authentic Empowerment’ to our people. On the very first day, he made his credo clear to me. He told me, looking directly into my eyes, “Moid, this place is new and you will encounter many types of bosses. Listen. When something works out fine, say, ‘I have done it’ and if it misfires say, ‘my boss had asked me to do so’. Take the credit when things work out smoothly ; shift the blame to me when things go wrong.” I was looking at him wondering how to respond. Finally, I did not say anything. Let me confess, many a time he took discredit boldly with a large heart when things misfired due to my mishandling of situations. Credit came to me even for the work which was actually done by my boss. </P>
<P>Later, when I became the corporate HR boss, I followed the credo that I had inherited from my boss: if something goes wrong, it is my fault; if something turns out great, he or she did it. Give credit to your people. “The group will not prosper if the leader grabs the lion’s share of the credit for good work that has been done,” cautions Lao Tzu, a well-known philosopher from Ancient China. The Pygmalion bosses know the art of managing from within which is different from the conventional management methods. Do not dominate, manifest. I could acquire and develop some traits of Pygmalion because some of my bosses were themselves great <em>Pygmalions</em>. </P>
<P>“I will tell you what makes a great manager,” shares Reggie Jackson. “A great manager has a knack for making ballplayers think they are better than they think they are. He forces you to have a good opinion of yourself. He lets you know he believes in you. He makes you get more out of yourself. And once you learn how good you really are, you never settle for playing anything less than your very best.” So, help create a positive, strong, mental makeup. </P>
<P>Remember, Pygmalion bosses are very passionate, loving and caring people. They support and restore confidence in one’s ‘self’. They do this magic through the power of ‘Expectations’, believing firmly that ‘you get what you expect!” </P>
<P>Forming expectations are natural and unavoidable. High expectations lead to high performance; low expectations lead to low performance. Better performance resulting from ‘high expectations’ makes the leader like his people more. Lower performance, resulting from ‘low expectations’, makes the leader like his people less. The boss tends to feel uncomfortable with people who do not meet his expectations, whether high or low. </P>
<P>Pygmalion Management is all about expectations – high and low. The end-result is the outcome of these expectations. What the boss expects from his subordinates and the way he treats them largely determines on his subordinates’ performance. A unique characteristic of a superior boss is his ability to create high performance expectations that subordinates ultimately fulfil. Less effective boss fails to develop high expectations, and as a consequence, the subordinates realize a lower output. Subordinates, more often that not, appear to do what they believe they are expected to do. </P>
<P>Pygmalion bosses know how to get the best from their people. They make their people become Galatea. When Pygmalion expected Galatea to acquire life, Galatea lived up to his expectations when God made her a living being. Thus, as a Pygmalion boss you must know how to get the best from your people. And as a Galatea subordinate you must know how to give off your best to meet the expectations of your boss and the organization. </P>
<P><em>Master Tip: </em><em>Create in yourself a Pygmalion first. If you want your people to perform better, simply raise the bar of your expectations articulately, honestly and in a supporting spirit. But keep the bar of appreciation low </em></P>
<P><em>–</em><em> praise them even for small achievements. </em></P>

<H2>14. The Achievers </H2>
<P>The Achievers are achievers, subordinates, managers, bosses or the CEO of an organization. ‘Achievers’ are a different variety altogether. For this reason I am not suffixing the noun ‘Boss’. The achiever is always an achiever; the hierarchical status makes little difference. </P>
<P>Achievers look for achievements. Their achievements are the real motivating force for them – recognition of their achievements are more motivating than some monetary award. They do not work for career-growth; career-growth is bound to happen if they prove by their actions that they are achievers. It comes by default, as a by-product of their contribution. Achieving their aim gives them greater personal satisfaction than receiving praise or recognition. Neither job security nor status is the prime motivator for them. They seek constant improvement on the principle ‘Better your Yesterday’ and ‘Better the Best’. They are very logical in their approach. </P>
<P>As mentioned, ‘achievement’ is the key driver for the Achievers. They are very realistic – they always keep their feet on the ground and understand ground realities. ‘Challenging goals’ excite them. They seek advancement in career proving their capabilities and giving results. Yet, more than career advancement, the sense of accomplishment gives them the utmost satisfaction. </P>
<P>The achievers enjoy ‘doing something not done before’. They also enjoy ‘successful completion of difficult and challenging tasks’. They look for achieving success by ability rather than by chance. If they get success by chance, they refuse to take the credit and never relish such a success. They can perform only those tasks with make ‘sense’ to them and has ‘meaning’ for them. They are highly organized and they expect their people to be fully organized. </P>
<P>At this point, when I look back to identify my achiever bosses whose profile and success stories can be quoted, a tall personality comes to my mind, again and again. I thought of postponing the citation about him in the beginning because he was not my boss. However, as his characteristic traits are in sync with what I have stated it would do injustice to this chapter if I spoke about him at the end and not at the beginning. </P>
<P>A person who perfectly fits into the mould of an ‘Achiever’ is RH Khwaja. I know him for the last one decade, from the time he was the Chairman and Managing Director of SCCL – Singareni Collieries Company Limited. He is an IAS officer, but I will not call him a ‘bureaucrat’ because he possesses high-quality entrepreneurship competencies. Later, he went back to assist the Government of India as Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests. Currently he is the Union Tourism Secretary, Government of India (He has been recently posted as Secretary, Ministry of Mines, Government of India). I have a very good relationship with him – more profound than a blood relationship. He is the co-author of my tenth Management book, “The Acrobatics of Change”, which is targeted for a sale of over 10,000 copies. </P>
<P>I know all about Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) and its working culture. Before I met RH Khwaja, SCCL was one of our prestigious clients when I was the Director (HR) in Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML). As a public sector person, I knew SCCL was one of the toughest mining companies to work in. Later, when I floated my own consulting company ‘Intellects </P>
<P>The Achievers 179 </P>
<P>Biz’, SCCL had welcomed me and sought my assistance for conducting workshops at their different mining complexes. </P>
<P>My meeting with RH Khwaja was accidental. Once I had received a call from the former Group General Manager, HR, SCCL. He wanted me to conduct a retreat in which his Chairman, Directors, and top team would participate. He wanted me to keep the ‘Balanced Scorecard’ as the central theme. When he shared with me that his CEO was from the IAS, I gave him some convincing excuses to avoid the assignment. Bureaucracy and I do not gel together. Even as a Director (HR) of a public sector company, I could never establish a heart-to-heart relationship with my <em>sarkari </em>bosses – the bureaucrats. </P>
<P>The HR Chief, however, was persistent, and I could not find an escape route. I met RH Khwaja for the first time at the resort where the retreat was organized. The whole day he remained on my mental scanner. I was watching him from all angles. Externally he seemed tough but his inner core was very soft. He was a highly disciplined person with great humility. I found him hard like a coconut shell on the outside and soft as its inner kernel. </P>
<P>Later I met Khwaja Saheb many times. To my mind, he is a great entrepreneur with qualities of ‘performing’ leadership. He is one of the great achievers I have met and worked with. He is highly focussed with a sharp memory. He took SCCL to greater heights yet gave wholehearted credit to his predecessors and his people for the turnaround. I am witness to many turnarounds. I have also read many turnaround stories. But this is a mining company which suffered many ailments -from Union militancy to Naxalite insurgency in those areas where its mining projects are located. One can use one’s leadership skills for taming the Union and managing good industrial relations. But how can one fight or negotiate with those who know only one language – terrorise and get your demands fulfilled? Managing such a mining company was itself a Herculean task, let alone taking it to greater heights and making it profitable and breaking all the performance records of the past. He could do this by managing from the heart. </P>
<P>Those who have read his ‘The Singareni Love Story’, the second part of the book ‘The Acrobatics of Change’, will appreciate the hardships, delicacies and the challenges involved in such turnarounds. ‘The turnaround, as they call it, was my romance with nature and the people of Singareni who have now got an identity as <em>Singarenians</em>’. He created ‘bonding’ among the Singarenians by not only giving them a unique identity but also wisdom through his slogan: ‘One Family; One Vision; One Mission’! While sharing the story of success, he did recognize the contribution of his predecessor, APVN Sarma, calling him ‘a bold and visionary leader’. He gave the lion’s share of success to his team, not in a generic or cursory manner, but by mentioning each name and that person’s contribution in the turnaround. </P>
<P>“I was deeply touched to see the inherent optimism, sincerity and dedication of our underground workers when I inspected the mines. I promised myself that I would try my best to improve their working conditions. After all our underground workers constitute the backbone of coal mining operations in SCCL,” he correctly observed. He located the backbone of the organization, considered its worth and determined to strengthen it so as to strengthen the entire organization. </P>
<P>His Achiever’s characteristics come out clearly when he writes, “Yes, my ‘quiet conscience’ was making me stronger. I could feel that. My enthusiasm was getting renewed with each cockcrow. I felt a strange soothing effect in my heart and a new happiness which was until now unknown to me.” This is what I have mentioned in </P>
<P>The Achievers 181 </P>
<P>the beginning of this chapter – the real achiever is inspired by his achievements and results, not by monetary rewards or material gains. </P>
<P>As you will find out later, one of the deficiencies which has been assigned to achievers by many management Gurus, including David Clarence McClelland who is known for discovering three motivational drivers of leaders, is low-ebb on the HR front. It is believed that since the Achievers are highly focused and result oriented, many times they fail on the ‘human front’. Yet, there is a very insignificant minority of Achievers that works well on both fronts – results and people. RH Khwaja falls in the category of this insignificant minority. He is a high achiever with a humane heart. He is very vibrant and vigorous in his efforts yet very humble and kind to people. </P>
<P>Against this backdrop, I will place RH Khwaja at a level a bit higher than Achievers – at level 5 of Leadership. As mentioned, many Achievers suffer from certain weaknesses. Though Achievers are very good in getting results, many times they get it by compromising with human aspects. However, Khwaja Saheb is a paradoxical blend of ‘personal humility’ and ‘professional will’. </P>
<P>“We are surprised, shocked really, to discover type of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one,” writes Jim Collins in his book ‘Good to Great’. “Compared to high-profile leaders with big personalities who make headlines and become celebrities, the good-to-great leaders seem to have come from Mars. Self-effacing, quiet, reserved, even shy.” Their recognition is the paradoxical combination of ‘humility’ and ‘will’. Most interestingly, the level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves. It is not that level 5 leaders have no ego or self-interest; they do have it. But they subordinate the self interest to their goals and objectives. For them, their ‘ambition’ is first and foremost for the company or institution, not for themselves. Level 5 leaders build enduring <SPAN>greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. All those companies who have witnessed a turnaround had ‘level 5’ leadership at the time of transition. These leaders are different kind of achievers – they cut against the grain of conventional wisdom, They discard the belief that we need ‘largerthan-life’ saviours with big personalities to transform companies. They are practical people. They are role models – strong-willed, humble and fearless. Khwaja Saheb possesses all these leadership traits. </SPAN></P>
<P>Assertiveness with humility is a very rare leadership trait — the leadership of the 21st century belongs to those who are unstoppable yet humble and kind. </P>
<P>Achievers live up to the challenging situations – they love challenges and put their mind, heart and soul to grab success. Now let me write something about one of my bosses whom I consider to be a great Achiever boss. </P>
<P>The Himalayas have nostalgic memories for me. I found the valley the native place of wisdom. I do not refer here to the <em>yogis</em> or <em>saints;</em> I going to tell you the real story of a high achiever. He was HC Bharadwaj, Superintendent Engineer of NHPC – National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation. The place was the Baira Siul project in the Himalayas. </P>
<P>I recall, it was an unprecedented cold winter when the fury of weather brought destruction where I was working as Manager (Personnel) during the mid- seventies of the preceding century. One of our sites – Tissa Dam – was totally cut off by landslides. It was just a chance factor that the senior-most person available at the Headquarters in the valley for taking crucial decisions at such a stressful time was a Superintendent Engineer, ranked equal to a Deputy General Manager in terms of conventional hierarchy. </P>
<P>The Achievers 183 </P>
<P>The very first step that HC Bharadawaj took was that he shifted his place of operation from his carpeted, well-structured and safe room to a wireless control room which was located in the landslides zone. This jacked up the morale of the project people. He demonstrated his risk by flexing his muscles and fearlessness. </P>
<P>“Most of the workers and their families are rendered homeless” was the first problem posted to him by wireless from the Tissa Dam Site </P>
<P>“Convert all the official complexes into rehabilitation centres, not only for our workers but also for the <em>Pahadis </em>(people who live on the mountains) who have been rendered homeless” was HC Bharadawaj’s decision given without any hesitation. </P>
<P>“The grief-stricken families need medicines.” This problem was posed to him the next day. </P>
<P>“Take medicines from the project medical stores even for those villagers who are not eligible under the company’s policy,” he ordered – a quick and bold decision. </P>
<P>“The store is locked. The pharmacist is not traceable for the past two days. Yet a private doctor is available who is willing to render his services voluntarily. “ </P>
<P>“Break open the medical store,” was his precise and firm reply, demonstrating that the executive exists to make sensible exceptions to the general rule. “Let the private practitioner decide upon the distribution of medicines free of charge. See, our objective is to save lives.” </P>
<P>“There is no improvement in the weather conditions. Our ration is exhausting fast. We are afraid that many people, especially the children, may die of hunger.” This problem was posed to him on the 7th day. </P>
<P>“Take the rations from the officers’ houses who are away on leave or tour.” </P>
<P>“Their houses are locked,” said the voice on the wireless, shaky with fear and not from the piercing cold of the winter wind. </P>
<P>“Break open the houses,” retorted HC Bharadawaj, coolly. This fearless decision broke all the norms of management and civil administration. </P>
<P>“It will be an illegal act,” said the voice on wireless, nervously. </P>
<P>“Don’t bother about legality, I take full responsibility. I repeat </P>
<P>– break open the locks and take all the ration available in those houses.” His orders were absolutely clear – he did not mince his words nor did he give any pause to the count of ten. </P>
<P>Later, HC Bharadawaj organized aerial food drop by seeking the assistance from the Air Force and other decisive action much beyond his delegation of powers. </P>
<P>Under the ‘play safe’ strategic environment, widespread in most of the companies today, the saga of professional bravery exhibited by these type of leaders appear to be like fairy tales. Let me hasten to add that Peter Block’s <em>Empowerment</em> was not known to the leaders of those days. </P>
<P>This is a true story of an achiever which has taught me the wisdom: Unusual situations can be dealt only with unusual decisions. One cannot fish for a whale by using an angling rod! </P>
<P>Achievers are risk-takers but they take a very calculated risk. But here was an achiever, who took on risks to the extent that he could have been jailed. Later, when the papers went to the Chairman, NHPC, for obtaining his ex-post-facto sanction, the Director (Finance) raised objections about whether a manager could take such important decisions, involving huge financial commitments, </P>
<P>The Achievers 185 </P>
<P>on his own authority. He suggested that an explanation be sought before the case was processed. But when the file went to the Chairman and Managing Director, he wrote, “I overrule the observations of Director (Finance) and grant ex-post-facto approval. I wish my managers must follow the spirit of Mr HC Bharadwaj.” He was Major General TV Jagannathan, PVSM &amp; AVSM (Retired), a renowned military man who was decorated with many gallantry awards during his active stint in the Army. </P>
<P>The Achievers are not gamblers. They watch, assess, analyse and take a highly ‘calculated’ risk. No wonder that in ‘risk-taking’ their success rate is very high. </P>
<P>Following are some of the specific characteristics of Achievers: </P>
<ul>
<LI>Doing something not done before </LI>
<LI>Successful completion of difficult tasks </LI>
<LI>Achieving success by ability rather than by chance or factors beyond their control </LI>
<LI>Preferring jobs where they can meet the objective </LI>
<LI>Achieving goals individually rather than through team-effort </LI>
</ul>
<P>Many management Gurus have mentioned that one of the major problems with many Achievers is that they are so focused and overwhelmed about their achievements and targets that many a time they compromise on human aspects and social relationships. But the great Achievers are those who are not only focused on their goals but also care for human aspects while achieving the result. </P>
<P>The Achievers want to prove their individual capabilities. They want to achieve by proving their own competence and worth, and therefore, some of them prefer an individualistic approach rather than a collective approach. But the real Achievers take care of their people and build up their teams. They are indeed a very rare species! </P>
<P><em>Master Tip: </em><em>As a tiger will never eat the grass, the Achiever will never let the project or mission fail. As the Singaporeans say in ‘Singlish’, “Die, die, must do”, the Achievers will never leave their mission unfulfilled. They are ‘unstoppable’. </em></P>
