>The stories that I have to tell in these pages date back to the year 1900 or thereabouts. It was the high noon of the British Raj. Queen Victoria was Empress of India. The state of Mysore, in which my Navaratna ancestors had been domiciled since the seventeenth century, was then being ruled by our dear late lord, Maharaja Krishna Raja IV of the ancient Wodeyar dynasty. Actually, the Maharaja was still a minor, and his mother, Her Highness Vani Vilas ruled as regent. Sir K. Seshadri Iyer was the prime minister or Diwan, as he was officially known; but the Diwan was subject to bouts of illness that was shortly to kill him and Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy – a family friend of ours – was frequently called upon to act in his place. And it was Krishna Murthy, who in a way was responsible for my giving up my law practice and joining the Mysore Government under his administration. This in turn was to lead to the adventures that I will now relate. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:38px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>There are not many people living today (1951) who remember those days. To those like me who do, the world looks very different indeed! The earth, the sky, the very universe seem in the past half century to have changed beyond recognition. Kingdoms and empires that then seemed as permanent as mountains have dissolved like dreams. The science we studied in college reads now like a badly-written fairy tale. Political, social, and worldly beliefs we then held to be high truths seem now like the superstitions of a primitive age. We, who then prided ourselves as the subjects of the greatest empire in the world, now with re-awakened interest in our own ancient history and culture recognize there is much the world can learn from us. British Raj is now history; the King of England is no more the Emperor of India; and the Wodeyar dynasty no longer rules Mysore. </SPAN

>It is not my intention, however, to describe all the changes that I have seen take place in the past fifty years and more; though, that in itself, would doubtless make for an interesting story. My goal in these pages is to recapture for you a general sense of the time and place in my country in the early years of this century – sketch some scenes, recreate some events, and portray characters from all walks of life, before the very memory of the era is lost forever in the mists of time. </SPAN

>My story begins in the year 1892, when I joined the Central College in Bangalore, majoring in science or PCM – physics, chemistry and mathematics—as such majors were then designated. And there, it was my great good fortune to acquire two friendships that have enriched my life beyond measure. The first of these was of my great friend, teacher, Guru, mentor, and benefactor, Professor John G. Tait; the other, of my life-long friend Rajaji (C. Rajagopalachari), later to be one of India's immortal national leaders, and to serve as her last Governor General. </SPAN

And to them, and especially to Tait, I owe a debt of gratitude that I can never repay. He was a second father to me, a man whom I revere next only to God. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Despite such economic hardships, I count my college days in Madras as one of the happiest times in my life. There was no limit to the scope of our philosophy or the sweep of our imagination. The Boer War was raging at the time, and a fellow student who once needed to borrow some clean clothes from me for a job interview, prefaced his request with the remark that the idiot Chamberlain had brought disgrace on all of us by provoking the Boers! This gives some idea of how many Indians those days identified themselves with the British; for the most part, the nationalist movement was still in the future. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:12px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Among my closest friends then was Dasappa of Hadya, one of the most brilliant men I have known. His life was tragically cut short when he was accidentally drowned in 1904. His was an extrovert personality with an outrageous sense of humor, which manifested itself in the most unexpected ways. Here is an example that is still vivid in my memory. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-bottom:18px">
<SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif'; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>It is not necessary to go into the details of this tragedy beyond noting that his wife Kamalamma Dasappa stood helplessly by as her husband was swept away by the rushing flood. More details can be found in the Kannada original. But the brave lady took the tragedy in her stride and became a pioneer in women’s education in Mysore. The well-known women’s institution known as Mahila Seva Samaj in Bangalore is partly her work. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>A major problem we all faced then was finding some decent eateries that were also affordable. For the most part, they were of wretched quality, and did not remotely provide the kind of food and service that we take for granted in restaurants today. There was one establishment in particular that Dasappa and I used to frequent. It used to be run by a fellow by name Shankara Iyer. His customers were mostly people from out of town on limited budgets, that is to say, students like us who had few other options. He economized on everything by buying the cheapest possible ingredients that could be found. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>One evening, after having been forced to endure particularly atrocious fare, Dasappa asked to see the cook. As Shankara Iyer stepped into the dining area, Dasappa stood up, threw his arms around the cook, and burst into sobs. We were aghast. Shankara Iyer was </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>flabbergasted. Someone asked Dasappa if there had been a tragedy like a death in the family. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>&quot;No, something far worse,&quot; replied my friend still sobbing uncontrollably. &quot;I have known many rotten cooks but none to compare with this fellow – Shankara Iyer. He's a peerless artist – in a class all by himself. If he should eat some of his own preparation today and die of it, where in the world are we going to find another like him? Isn't that a loss great enough to mourn?&quot; </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This carefree existence was jolted one day, by a telegram from my father asking me to come to Mysore to meet with Diwan Krishna Murthy. The Diwan himself had asked for the meeting. This was in the year 1900 or 1901. </SPAN

><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Diwan was the highest official in the realm; it was not every day that a college student like me got invited to meet him. I assumed that the reason was he wanted me to work for him. I knew that appointments of assistant commissioner (deputy collector) were made on the basis of qualifications and family reputation. I assumed I was being considered for one of those positions. When one of my friends brought up the possibility, I told him that my head was too large to make an entry through the back door. Actually, I was hoping that it might happen, but was making a ‘pre-emptive excuse’ like the fox in the story ‘Sour Grapes’! </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I left for Mysore by train immediately. On the appointed day, my father and I went to see Krishna Murthy in his house. The Diwan's offices were in Bangalore, which was the administrative capital, but he also used to maintain a house in Mysore – the Maharaja’s seat – that he often visited on official work. He had a long line of visitors, and we had to wait quite a while. It was late in the afternoon by the time we were ushered into his presence. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Diwan’s visit to any place was no ordinary event. His whole entourage consisting of servants, officials, cooks, and just plain hangers-on, descended on the place like locusts. Whenever the Diwan graced some village with his attention, it took the hapless place a month or more to recover from the onslaught. It was not that the Diwan went to torment the people. His intentions were noble – to see firsthand the problems of the people and help them. But to those who </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It was different in Mysore where the Diwan had his own establishment. We found the Diwan seated in a massive chair in the company of his younger brother Purniya and one or two others. As soon as my father was announced, he came up and saluted him, leading him to a seat nearby. The long wait, the fatigue of the three hundred mile journey from Madras, my own youthful impatience – had all combined to put me in ill-humour. To make matters worse, the Diwan seemed oblivious to my presence. He was wholly occupied with talking to my father. I noticed that he treated my father with a great deal of respect. </SPAN

>Diwan Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy – better-known by his title as Jagirdar of Yelandur – was a short, somewhat portly man of about fifty, of plain appearance and fair complexion, with a black moustache. He was simply dressed, in the fashion of the day, wearing a black close-collared long coat and a white silk turban. Despite his unprepossessing appearance, his bearing was dignified yet unassuming, and his speech soft. He was one of the first graduates of the Bangalore Central College, had had a distinguished academic record, and was said to be one of the people responsible for getting Tait to his alma mater. The conversation </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>went on in Kannada and Marathi, for my father did not know English well. After what seemed to me like an eternity, he finally asked my father: </SPAN

<P style="text-align:left; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">

>I was standing close by, as conspicuous as a large gorilla and his remarks did nothing to improve my humor. I drew attention to myself by bowing and saluting him with folded hands, with exaggerated politeness. The Diwan peered at me through his glasses. His eyesight was poor, but I did not know it at the time. </SPAN

<P style="text-align:left; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>He then went on to recount the high regard in which he held my father as well my other ancestors for their services to the people through several generations. He also told me that he had heard many good things about me from my teachers and others. Then somewhat to my surprise, he complimented me on my English. </SPAN

<P style="text-align:left; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>To show his regard for my father, the Diwan continued, he wanted to help me by offering me a promising position in his Government. I had come with the expectation of a high position like assistant commissioner, but the tune of his speech did not sound like the prelude to such an exalted offer. Rather brusquely, I asked him for more details about his job offer. The Diwan frowned a little at my bluntness, but took the time to explain that he wanted me in his own office, to work as his personal aide and speechwriter. Newcomers to his office would normally be offered twenty rupees a month, but he was prepared start me on a salary of fifty. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

It is worth noting that Mysore, though officially part of the British Empire, was a semi-independent kingdom ruled by its own Maharaja. According to the terms of a treaty signed between the British and Maharaja Krishna Raja III (in 1799), the British were responsible for defense and foreign affairs, while the Maharaja's Government was responsible for domestic affairs. Madras and Salem on the other hand, were in the part of India under direct British administration, i.e., in the territory commonly referred to as British India. </SPAN

>I ran a successful practice in Salem, but my wife – Kashija Bai of Kallambilla – did not like the place. By then we had two daughters – Brahmani and Venku – and the hot and humid climate of Salem did not suit my wife. She longed to return to the cool uplands of Mysore that was our home. During these years Diwan Krishna Murthy had kept in touch with me through my father. Then, in 1903 or 1904, the Diwan's office contacted me again with the formal offer of the position of revenue probationer in the Government of Mysore. It was a stepping-stone to higher offices later, and much better than the Diwan's earlier offer. I was later to learn that this offer was partly the result of my performance in the Mysore Civil Service exams that I had taken about a year earlier at my father's behest. I was at first reluctant to give up my practice; but my wife and father both insisted. I finally accepted the offer. My wife and daughters left for Mysore. After closing my practice in Salem, I too returned to Mysore. </SPAN

I decided to stop for a few days in Bangalore and visit Tait, Diwan Krishna Murthy, and a few other senior friends. I first went to see the Diwan in his house ‘Purna Prasada’, meaning gift of Purnaiah. Purnaiah (see picture) was his famous ancestor who had been Diwan under Hyder and Tippu and established the family reputation. (It is also a pun on 'Purna' which refers to Madhvacharya, the founder of the sect to which the Diwan and I belonged.) It still exists and goes by the same name.

You'll make far more money by staying in practice. More important, you'll also keep your independence. So, don't be in a hurry to accept the Government's offer.

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This put me in a quandary. There was some truth in what he was saying. It was well-intentioned, but my decision had not been based on money. Though reluctant at first, I had become convinced that government service was my duty and I was answering a call. In the idealism of youth, I had been both flattered and gratified by all the attention I was getting from people at the highest levels of the government. In addition, there was no way I could go back on my word given to a man like Diwan Krishna Murthy. </SPAN

For administrative purposes, the ‘Princely State’, or the hereditary kingdom of Mysore, was divided into eight districts. The chief executive of the district was, and still is, the deputy commissioner or the DC. (He was known as ‘collector’ in the British administered territories.) He was responsible for law enforcement, revenue administration, and the administration of justice, though the higher courts which came under the Department of Justice were independent of the DC. One of the eight districts was Mysore district, headquartered in Mysore city. I had been posted to Mysore to be on the staff of the DC. Though Bangalore was the administrative capital and somewhat larger, Mysore, as the ancient ceremonial capital and the seat of the Maharaja's court, enjoyed considerable prestige. So my posting to Mysore was a prized one. </SPAN

The Sirdar was a man in his thirties, of medium height, of dark complexion, and of slender athletic build. Having been a practicing lawyer in Salem, in British India, I was naturally curious about the procedures in the Maharaja's courts. With one exception, none of the lawyers present in the court that day was especially well-known. My initial impression was they were not as good as my former colleagues in Salem. (My friend Rajaji was of course an exceptionally able and successful lawyer who was soon to give up everything to follow Mahatma Gandhi in the Freedom Movement.) And the one lawyer in court that day who was relatively well-known was distinguished more by showmanship than ability. His name was Ramanna. He was arguing before the magistrate in a mixture of Kannada and English that can still be heard in Mysore courts. I still remember the exchange between the lawyer Ramanna and the judge.

He lived in a large house near the district office called the ‘Old Guest Quarters’. It still goes by the same name. Every senior official in those days used to have a room in his home reserved for official work. People would often come and see him even when he was off duty. I sent my card in with the orderly and waited. </SPAN

This was the DC, my superior officer! He was also reputed to be one of the ablest men in the Government. Having seen at first hand the officiousness and the pomposity of high officials in British India, I was unprepared for such a reception. I was totally nonplussed. It also brought to my mind a well-known Sanskrit proverb: </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I felt I better be on my guard, at least until I got to know him better. He kept on addressing me as 'Sir', which added to my discomfort. After making ourselves comfortable in his study – at least he made himself comfortable – he said to me, &quot;Will you please wait a few minutes, sir, till I complete what I am writing?&quot; and went on with his work. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I studied his face. It was a refined, cultured, face but one full of self-confidence that comes with long-time exercise of high authority. I next examined the situation I was in. I felt that he must somehow have formed the idea that I was arrogant. In those days I was often described as being arrogant, and my card – lying on his table – with all my qualifications emblazoned on it did little to counter it. In addition, the brand new expensive suit and the highly fashionable boots I was wearing were in sharp contrast to his own simple attire. I made up my mind to erase any false impression he might have formed before it could take firm root. </SPAN

Even though English is not our language, as with any language, we must respect the rules of grammar and usage when we employ it. The document he handed to me could have used some corrections, but I felt it was not the wise thing to do. I pointed out to him that as a probationer, my job was to study and learn, not criticize. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Poor Mr. Srinivasa Murthy managed a baleful laugh as if he had just swallowed a large dose of castor oil. I began to see that V.V. Iyengar had an unusual sense of humor and his deferential manner was largely a pose – his own way of laughing at pompous officials who take themselves too seriously. The latter is a species of which there is never a shortage. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>For the next year or so, until V.V. Iyengar was promoted chief secretary and posted to Bangalore, I worked closely with him. My main function was to serve as the DC's private secretary and staff officer. I would study all revenue-related cases that came to his office and report my findings to him. Occasionally, he would hand me a case of particular importance for detailed study. I would then look over it carefully, prepare a summary highlighting the salient points, and, if necessary, personally discuss the case with him. Also, as I was a lawyer and he was not, he would bring cases to my attention for legal opinion. I would then submit my opinion together with a summary of my arguments. He soon came to like me and depended heavily on my advice. He fully trusted my judgment in matters of law and revenue. My respect and affection for him also grew. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>All this experience was very valuable to me, for V.V. Iyengar was a very able official with an exceptional grasp of detail. It is fair to say that I acquired most of my knowledge of the workings of our Government during the year or so I was with V.V. Iyengar. I served in the Government for thirty years, but the foundation was laid during that one year in Mysore. His personality was unusual, to say the least – for V.V. Iyengar was a true eccentric. But as often is the case with such people, it was hard to tell how much of it was real and how much just cultivated showmanship. He had a rare talent for introducing a humorous twist to ticklish situations, which sometimes helped resolve problems. I will next relate a story about him that will give an idea of what I mean. </SPAN

>The Government needed to acquire some private land for a public works project like a road or some such thing. The owner happened to be a Muslim gentleman whose name I cannot now recall. The Government’s offer was fair, but the owner wanted more. Seeing that the subordinates were making little progress, the DC, V.V. Iyengar himself, came to the meeting to persuade the owner. If I remember right, the Government was prepared to pay two hundred rupees an acre, but the owner wanted five hundred. </SPAN

>Iyengar was reputed to be an honest official. He was certainly honest, but sometimes took his honesty to absurd limits. Once, during a visit to a village in his district, a wealthy farmer who had just acquired a pair of beautiful thoroughbred oxen came to see V.V. Iyengar. As a mark of respect, or purely out of vanity, the farmer offered to take the DC to the next village on his circuit in his cart, drawn by the new pair of oxen of which he was so proud. The DC accepted. Upon reaching their destination, V.V. Iyengar tried to pay the farmer ten annas at two annas per mile – the then prevailing rate. The farmer refused. He pointed out to the DC that with his hospitality he was only showing his respect for the Maharaja whose representative the DC was at the district level. But this DC never accepted anything free. He rented a cart to take him back to the original village, and then rented another cart to take him to his destination a second time. Only then was his conscience satisfied. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This incident was said to have taken place sometime before I joined him. So I can’t vouch for it. But it is entirely consistent with his personality as I knew it. It reminds me of a similar story about a famous country doctor known as ‘the Pandit’ who was of my father's generation. He was a master at combining medical science with astrology and magical chants. This man had descended from a long line of doctors of his own kind who had acquired great wealth and fame by concocting remedies for every ailment known to man. </SPAN

Anyway, the Pandit instructed one of his assistants to prepare a potion by grinding this tablet in cow's urine, executing exactly five revolutions clockwise. But his assistant was absent-minded. When asked by his master, the fellow admitted that by mistake he had </SPAN

>The account given so far does not do full justice to V.V. Iyengar, for he was a remarkable man with a strong sense of social justice. Chakravarti Venkata Varada Iyengar, to give his full name was a non-conformist with a reformist bent of mind. We don’t know when exactly he was born but since he retired in 1907 when he would have been 55, the retirement age those days, we may assume he was born around 1852. This tallies with Rama Rao’s statement he was nearly ‘twice my age’ in 1904 when Rama Rao was about 27. He was born into an orthodox Srivaishnava (Iyengar) Brahmin family but became a staunch follower of the reformist Hindu sect and movement Arya Samaj and its leader Swami Shraddhanada. As part of this he married Krishna Bai, a young widow from outside his caste. After her marriage to Iyengar, Krishnamma, as she came to be known, actively participated in her husband’s philanthropic works. </SPAN

She was encouraged by one Mrs. Pitt (first name unknown) the widow of Isaac Pitt who had been collector (deputy commissioner) of Penukonda to pursue her own life and interests regardless of her widowhood. Through friends of common interest she became acquainted with V.V. Iyengar, then just out of Maharaja’s College in Mysore and married him. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Krishnamma was not interested in just finding a husband, she wanted to do something for others in the same plight. Mrs. Pitt advised her that the best thing for her to do was to found a home for destitute women. Her husband was also thinking along similar lines. Being a man of strong convictions who practiced what he preached, he founded an informal institution called ‘Abalashrama’ (meaning refuge for powerless women in Sanskrit and Kannada). In the beginning he used his own home to house young women and teach them practical skills. They were comparatively well off but the expenses of caring for so many people taxed their resources to the limit. Kamalamma sold off a good deal of her inheritance including jewelry to finance their activities. Mrs. Pitt who was then living in Cambridge occasionally visited them and made small donations. (She was not a wealthy woman.) </SPAN

>Their activities began in 1907 soon after Iyengar retired from service. For several years they supported it with their own resources supplemented by donations from friends, but their work soon attracted wide attention and began to receive substantial donations. What is remarkable from contemporary reports is the strong sense of reform and charity that prevailed among the elite. At first the couple faced ostracism for their unconventional marriage, but their charitable work changed it to admiration and respect. In 1911 they received funds from the government for a dedicated building. It was inaugurated by Iyengar himself at public request. </SPAN

>The threat, if carried out, would be seen as a major embarrassment to the village; even a disgrace. I knew of Basava Rajappa. He was a pleader or paralegal assistant in Mysore where he had built up quite a reputation as a trouble-maker and publicity-seeker; and I knew him to be fully capable of carrying out his threat. I knew also that he was already in Megalapur. So I briefed the Amildar, the Patel, and other officials about the situation. They were horrified. Everyone seemed to be at a loss. The Patel finally asked me what was to be done about the threat. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The next day – the day of the royal visit – I came down to Megalapur before dawn and inspected an old ruined temple situated a few hundred yards from the reception area. It had long been out of use, but was still structurally sound with heavy solid doors. I then went back and met with the Patel. </SPAN

>&quot;Have four or five strong men – preferably wrestlers – ready at the reception,&quot; I told him. &quot;Then, as soon as I give this signal, tell them to seize Basava Rajappa, and forcibly carry him into that temple. They are to keep him there locked until the royal party is safely out of town. If there is any noise, we shall tell His Highness that it is the village lunatic who had to be kept confined for fear he might go berserk.&quot; </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Patel left immediately to find the necessary men. I next went and stationed a trumpeter at an eminence, just outside the village, from where he could see down the road for more than a mile. I left instructions with him to alert us with a trumpet blast as soon as he spotted the royal party. I then went over to the reception area and waited nervously for the trumpeter’s signal. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>In the reception area, we had erected a porch and laid several tables stocked with fruits, flowers, and other paraphernalia used by Brahmin priests in those days for receiving the king. I had also stationed a band of musicians who I thought might help drown out any noises that might be coming from the direction of the temple. Basava Rajappa was also present. I felt a twinge of guilt upon seeing his diminutive figure, standing there, blissfully unaware of the fate I had in store for him. Once again I tried to reason with the man. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>&quot;Sir, this is a joyful occasion for these people,&quot; I told him. &quot;Why don't you just give up your idea? What do you hope to get out of ruining an occasion, which means so much to everyone? Your case belongs in court. I am an official in the DC's office. Bring your case to me. If it has merit I'll personally bring it to the DC's attention. That's where your case belongs.&quot; </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>But Basava Rajappa was not to be budged from his stand. The more we tried reasoning with him, the more insolent his attitude became. It was soon clear that he was more interested in gaining some notoriety than in seeing justice done. It made me feel he fully deserved what he was about to get. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Before long we heard the pre-arranged signal from the trumpeter. This meant the royal party would be arriving in about a quarter of an hour. I gave the signal to the Patel, and he gave the go ahead to his men. Four powerfully-built men came forward, grabbed Basava Rajappa, and carried him kicking and screaming in the direction of the temple. His wails tailed away and within a few minutes he could no longer be heard. The Patel must have informed the villagers what to expect; no one acted surprised. Some just laughed, while others took it quietly; but no one said a word in his defense. I also gave instructions to the musicians to start playing the royal anthem. I was taking no chances. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>My senior friend, the late Dasappa of Belavadi, was a true eccentric and it was no pose. But few saw beyond his superficial eccentricities. He was a profound scholar of literature in several languages and also of Indian philosophy. In many ways he was my guru. He was a schoolmaster of genius – in an age when schoolmasters were greatly respected. He often visited us in our house in Mysore. He would come invariably dressed in spectacular riding clothes with a sword dangling from his waist, followed by a servant who carried a chair for him to sit on! I once caught him cutting a piece out of an old leather back chair I had, for he thought he could fashion a good shield out of it! </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

He was, as I noted, a profound scholar of Indian philosophy and a student of medieval Indian history, which he tried to act out. Once he became so absorbed with horsemanship that he used to go around in the most outlandish costumes fashioned after Rajput warriors of medieval India. He had absolutely no inhibitions. </SPAN

>Soon after joining the Maharaja's Government, I was appointed a ‘third class’ magistrate in the court in Mysore. This meant that relatively minor cases – mostly civil disputes – were heard before me. It was of course an honor, and I presided over the proceedings with great dignity – or so I fondly thought. But being very young, it is quite possible I was just overbearing. In any event, one of the cases that came into my court involved one Panduranga Shetty – a local politician of some standing – who was thought to have many influential friends; at least that was the impression he gave. A neighbor of his – an elderly widow – had charged him with trespassing on her property and carrying off some building materials (stone slabs) that she had bought to renovate her bathroom. Her complaint had been filed in my court. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The evidence was overwhelming; Panduranga Shetty had no case. But he was the sort of man who believed that his political influence was sufficient for him to bend the law to suit his own ends. He knew his way about the courts and would bring a different lawyer to each hearing. His arrogance seemed to know no bounds. He treated my court with utter disdain; it was after all just a 'third class' magistrate's court. After hearing the case, I told him I would announce my judgment the following day, and asked him to be present at eleven. He said he had to be at the first class magistrate's court at that time. I told him to come at three. He said he had to be present at an appeal in the district court at that time and could only come at four. I agreed. </SPAN

Ranga Iyengar, who, I later learnt, denounced my judgment as high-handed arrogance while portraying Panduranga Shetty as a simple soul and a victim of my wrath. The day after the </SPAN

Two regiments of the Indian army, stationed in Bangalore, would be camping in the forests of Bandipur on their way to the Nilgiri Mountains for Christmas holidays. That part of the country – i.e., Bandipur which is in Gundalpet taluk – was all wilderness, and included what is now the famous Bandipur wild life sanctuary. I had been assigned to assist the local Amildar – the chief of Gundalpet taluk – in making arrangements for the two regiments. In reality, it meant ensuring that the British officers of the regiment were looked after in that wild place. I travelled to Gundalpet a couple of days prior to the scheduled visit and saw the Amildar. </SPAN

He was a hide-bound official of the old school, always trying to impress people with some real or imagined connection with the durbar in Mysore. He was also fond of affecting the mannerisms of the durbar. His taluk was mostly wilderness with hardly any villages, which allowed him the time to indulge in these antics. </SPAN

Any time of the day or night, a messenger can come dashing in and say, 'My lord! You are commanded to be at the palace today.' I have no choice but to go. At a palace dinner, the atmosphere is so tense – you can't speak or cough – or even blow your nose! This goes on even after dinner. We can relax only after His Highness has retired for the night. It is no fun being close to royalty.&quot; </SPAN

He is a very experienced man and knows what all needs to be done. I have also left instructions with the supply officer and the forest ranger to take care of supplies and living arrangements. You can rest assured that everything has been taken care of. There is nothing for you to do. Your presence here is a formality.

One of them was Subedar Major Sholapuri – a highly-decorated soldier and renowned marksman. He was a peerless rifle shot who had won prizes at national and international meets.

This was in 1904 – the heyday of the Raj – and British officers often outranked Indians of greater experience, even when they did not have much responsibility in the field. (The situation was somewhat like in some oil sheikdoms where natives are appointed ‘managers’ with experienced foreigners hired to assist them.) Their commanding officer – one Colonel Stevens – had known about me through Tait, and treated me with a good deal of respect. Their respect seemed to increase when they learnt that even in their own field – military history – I was well read in topics like the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War, the Sudan Campaign, and the like, and had also written about them. Tait had told him about these articles and might even have shown a few of them. We soon became friends. </SPAN

This included his personal orderly, the groom for his horse, the police Dafedar, the bullock cart driver, the Shekdar of the area, clerks, a few servants, and village accountants, public works officials like the tank inspector and the works inspector, and sometimes the police inspector. None of them received any traveling allowance. Later, the Amildar was granted an allowance of one rupee a day, as I recall. It was the responsibility of the village to take care of them and provide the necessary supplies. The whole party used to eat with the Amildar in the camp. They were often joined by village notables like the Patel as well as some strangers. No one was turned away. Lunch, which was the main meal, used to be served around one in the afternoon. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Some years later, when I was assistant commissioner (deputy collector), I felt that the authority of the Amildar was not what it used to be in my time, even though the camp arrangements had not changed much. But these things rarely come to the assistant commissioner’s attention. I recall an occasion when I was assistant commissioner and subdivision officer (SDO), I was camping in a taluk in connection with some survey work. The survey officer in charge was a seasoned professional who had worked under British officials. The Amildar and I used to join the survey officer for lunch in his camp. </SPAN

He was a very able and experienced officer who always travelled with his pony carrying a small provisions bag and cooking vessels. There were several complaints against him. The main charge was that he used to extort luxury items like almonds, cream, milk, </SPAN

Any village that failed to comply with his requests would face harassment by having its water cut off or its drainage repair work stalled or something else.

>Early in the year 1905, I took over charge as Amildar of Yedatore taluk in the Mysore district. Just as the state of Mysore was divided into districts (then eight), each district was divided into administrative units called taluks. The Amildar was the chief executive officer of the taluk with responsibility for revenue collection, law enforcement, and the administration of justice. Yedatore in those days had about two hundred villages and a population of around sixty thousand people. Later, when I was Amildar of the more urban Narsipur taluk, I was responsible for a population that exceeded a hundred thousand. I had under me a staff of about sixty men; the taluk police department headed by the inspector also reported to me. And I was also the presiding magistrate of the taluk court. All in all, it was a highly responsible position, not usually given to a twenty-seven-year-old youth as I then was. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>During my one year as probationer in Mysore I had occasion to act as Amildar of a taluk when the regular Amildar was away on leave; it was considered part of my training. During that time I had made this important discovery: to the people of princely Mysore, in those days, the Government really meant the Amildar and the deputy commissioner (DC), especially the former. To them, the Maharaja was the mostly invisible God's representative on earth, known and addressed through prayers. The king's representatives on the spot who dispensed his grace and justice were the Amildar at the local level, and the DC in the higher echelons of the Government. The Government also took care to protect the Amildar's dignity and authority. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>had ruled Mysore from 1831 to 1881, following the dismissal of the Maharaja for ‘maladministration’ of the state. The Commission had revamped the system that had suffered due to disorder and needless experimentation. They replaced former offices like the Faujdar with civil servants like the DC and the assistant commissioner. These did not exist before the Commission took over the Government. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:12px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>To the people of Mysore, these changes represented a major break with tradition. The position of Amildar – formerly called Subedar – had been retained however, and served as a link with their hoary past. Even in my time, more often than not, people referred to me as their Subedar. Thus, the Amildar (or Subedar) was the only high official – other than the Diwan and the Maharaja – to whom the people could still relate. Also, during the Commission rule, many officials above the grade of Amildar did not speak Kannada – the native language – which served to further increase the Amildar's authority and influence. A good deal of its residual influence still existed in my time, though I was to witness its gradual erosion with the increasing sophistication of the people. In many ways I was one of the very last of the old-time Amildars. </SPAN

>The dismissed ruler was Krishna Raja Wodeyar III. It was restored to his adopted son Chama Raja X in 1881. There is still controversy over whether it was justified, but in restoring it to the royal family, the British Government tacitly admitted that it had violated the treaty. </SPAN

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif'; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>The main charge, that Mysore had not paid the subsidy on time is false. Some British observes believed that the Madras Governor Thomas Munro who instigated the takeover wanted Bangalore, which has much more pleasant climate than Madras (now Chennai) for his capitol. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:18px">
<SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif'; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>There was also much popular discontent, some of it instigated by British agents. Part of the problem was the arbitrary rule of the usurper Tippu Sultan who uprooted many offices and institutions that had proved their worth over the centuries. So the Maharaja in 1799 inherited a shattered administrative machinery that could not cope with the challenges of a modern state. The British Commission rule marked the transition from a traditional to a modern state. This was made possible by outstanding officials – both British and Indian. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This situation introduced an interesting anomaly. Though a civil servant in my time, the Subedar, in former times, had ruled the taluk in the Maharaja's name, as his representative. As a result, in the eyes of </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>the people, the Amildar was still a ruler, and it was as a ruler rather than as an administrator that he was judged. This meant that his relationship with the people more than his management of his office, determined his standing in his taluk. Anyone who understood this basic tenet and commanded the trust and confidence of the people could be assured of their loyalty and even love. Unlike today (1951) when he is little more than a book-keeper at the beck and call of every local politician, the Amildar in those days had real power. The Government too took great care to safeguard his dignity and authority. The DC was always conscious of this. Here is an incident that I personally witnessed when I was still a probationer in Mysore. </SPAN

Their instruments should not be confused with those used by musicians; the trumpets we used were fashioned from cow-horn by inserting a mouthpiece with a reed, and produced a horrid scream when blown; in Kannada they are known as kombu and kahale.

Whenever one of them showed up, blew his trumpet, and saluted them, my daughters would delightedly hand over their candy money to the trumpeter. Of all my recollections from that era, few can be as vivid as those of the trumpets and the trumpeters. The trumpeter is now only a memory. The trumpet, along with its abominable discharge of sound has also disappeared; but I still </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>hear it in my dreams. And the sound of it takes me back to a time half a century ago, and seems to bring back my youth if only for a fleeting moment. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>By tradition, the trumpeter was entitled to a few privileges in each town and village in the taluk. Whenever the Amildar happened to be camping in a particular village, the liquor shop had to give the trumpeter a filling of local liquor known as arrack – distilled from palm fruit – poured into his trumpet. For this reason, trumpeters used to have the inside of their horns coated with pewter metal. The trumpeter would go to the liquor shop, salute the owner with a blast, and hold up the trumpet with the large end up. The owner would then fill the trumpet with arrack. I have heard rumors of other privileges that I cannot vouch for. Their essence was— food in the house of the village chief, and bed in the house of the village madam. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>In every taluk I visited, the trumpeters invariably carried the same occupational names for generations – names that had nothing to do with their real names. In Yedatore, my trumpeters went by the names Dodda Yalakki and Chikka Yalakki, which may be translated as ‘Big Cardamom’ and ‘Little Cardamom’. Later, when I was Amildar of Narsipur, they were Dodda Betta and Chikka Betta – ‘Big Hill’ and ‘Little Hill’ (Mysoreans those days, like American Indians, were partial to picturesque names). Before them, their respective fathers had borne the same occupational names, as had their fathers before them. And these worthies had announced the comings and goings of Subedars to the Maharajas' subjects from generation to generation for the better part of five centuries. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It should not be imagined that the trumpet service existed only as a mark of official prestige. The personal style of governance we had in those days made extensive use of trumpets and trumpeters. When the Amildar visited any village, a trumpet blast, which could be heard by the whole village, would announce that he was in town. This was the signal for the village servants to get ready to receive him. When he entered his office – either his permanent office at the taluk headquarters, or a makeshift office in the village on his circuit – the trumpets would again announce to the people that they could bring their cases to be heard by their taluk chief. At the end of the day, the trumpets would announce the closing of the workday. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The trumpet service, in addition to being a useful instrument in the discharge of official duties, was an honor much coveted by junior taluk officials. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I remember an amusing story involving a trumpeter and an Amildar's assistant known as Shirastedar. This had taken place in Yedatore a few years before I assumed charge. The then Amildar had gone on a few days' leave leaving his assistant in charge. This fellow had long harbored a nagging resentment that he was not receiving from his superior the respect and attention that was his due. Now that he was the acting Amildar, he decided to take advantage of the opportunity to exalt himself. And the instrument of his exaltation was to be the trumpet service, which he sought to exercise way beyond what was regular and proper in the discharge of his official duties. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This put the trumpeter in an awkward position. There was only one trumpeter— for the assistant, as acting Amildar was entitled to a single trumpet; only the regular Amildar could have two trumpets blown. Such was the protocol in those days. Excessive zeal on the part of this one trumpeter, as the acting Amildar demanded, could lead to misunderstanding. The regular Amildar, though on leave, was in town and might conclude that his deputy was being accorded all this added attention on the trumpeter's own initiative. To clear the possibility of any such misunderstanding, the trumpeter stopped by the Amildar's home that night to explain the situation.&quot;My lord!&quot; pleaded the trumpeter, &quot;what am I to do? Your assistant demands it.&quot; </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>&quot;I understand,&quot; replied the Amildar. &quot;It is attention he wants. Redouble your efforts. Don't let him stir without a trumpet blast. You understand what I mean.&quot; </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>A couple of days later, in evening, as the regular Amildar was relaxing in his study, enjoying his leave from work, he was rudely awakened from gentle slumber he had fallen into, by a trumpet blast. Annoyed at this interruption he came out to investigate. There was his assistant – the acting Amildar – shaking with indignation, with the trumpeter standing right behind him. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>&quot;Sir, this trumpeter is tormenting me,&quot; said the assistant. &quot;He has his infernal instrument blaring all over the place. I can't take one step without its fiendish blast. When I go into the bathroom, he lets loose an ungodly blare. He lets out another when I come out. On my circuit – this morning – when I stopped by the roadside to go into a bush to answer a nature call, he announced it with a trumpet blast; he gave out another when I returned. Last night, when my wife and I were going into the bedroom, we were startled to hear a trumpet blast from just outside the window. It is humiliating. He has made me the laughing stock of the town. Now everyone in town knows my daily schedule down to the smallest detail. And he refuses to stop without your order.&quot; </SPAN

>One more story about the trumpets. This took place in Devana Halli, my ancestral place, at a time when my father was still a youngster (c. 1850). Amildars those days had enormous authority, and used to conduct themselves with the style and bearing of royalty. The Amildar of Devanahalli at the time was one Srinivasa Rao, a man of imperious bearing. (He might be the same man who in old age admitted to his infidelity, but this is just a guess.) Devanahalli is an ancient and historic town surrounded by an old fort. He used to live in a palatial house inside the fort. On his way to his office, he would always go through the main street (or market street) where all the shops were located. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>His daily transit from his home to his office was a ceremonial affair, almost like a royal march. A trumpet blast would announce that he had left the fort, and another, a few minutes later, when he entered the market. Immediately, the shopkeepers and the customers would line up outside the shops awaiting his arrival. Sometimes he would be on horseback, holding a white umbrella in one hand; at other times he would be on foot, walking majestically in the shade of a large white umbrella carried by a police officer. In either case, he would always be preceded by two uniformed policemen, and followed by four taluk servants in livery. In days gone by they used to have blazing ceremonial torches accompanying this parade, even in daytime. The practice had been given up when some bright Amildar made the discovery that artificial lights are not needed in broad daylight. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>As this parade wound its way through the main street, all the shopkeepers would stand up and salute the Amildar. This practice had continued into my own day – just the salute that is, not the procession with day torches. When someone, being either new to the place or just more than ordinarily dense, failed to stand up and salute, others would signal to him. It was a time-honored practice. </SPAN

>Back to the Devanahalli of Srinivasa Rao's time; a newcomer to the </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>town – a merchant who had made a fortune in Bangalore and Madras – felt that such feudal practices were beneath him. Also, for some unknown reason, he wanted to impress upon the people his own importance by humiliating the Amildar and make him react with undignified anger. He had settled in Devanahalli only recently, opening a shop in the market. Each day, as the Amildar and his entourage arrived on its daily march, this merchant would not only fail to show his respect as custom demanded, but would go out of his way to show off his own importance. He made it a point to draw attention to himself by assuming a conspicuously languid pose on his couch, loudly calling on his attendant to adjust his pillow, or footstool, or some such thing. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>When informed of it, the Amildar ignored the whole thing and advised everyone to do the same. This frustrated the merchant. He was doing all this to attract some attention to himself, but no one seemed to care. Then, one day, he had a brilliant idea. He would employ his own trumpeter! This would surely upstage the Amildar in a way no one could ignore. People were shocked at this effrontery. Several men, claiming to be his well-wishers, but probably acting on the Amildar's behalf, advised him against it. </SPAN

>few days he began to notice something strange. Every morning, as his trumpet announced the opening of his shop, a rather bulky, powerfully-built man would be standing right in front of his shop relieving himself in public. At first the merchant tried to ignore it, but this unwholesome greeting was taking place much too regularly to be accidental. He also learnt that the culprit was a clerk or a copyist in the Amildar's office. He was tempted to have him evicted by force, but realized that the case would be tried in the Amildar's court if he laid a hand on the man. He decided his best course was to try to talk him out of this foul practice. The next day, after the man had performed his daily ritual, the merchant confronted him. </SPAN

>Returning to my own time, shortly before I was to take charge as Amildar of Yedatore, V.V. Iyengar had been appointed chief secretary in Bangalore, and an Englishman by name Sparkes had replaced him as DC. In the interim, my friend Kantha Raje Urs had been acting DC. Sparkes had a formidable reputation as a rider. In those days, it was not sufficient to be good in studies and office work to be effective as a civil servant. Horsemanship was required of all officials; back then, the horse was the principal means of transportation. I didn’t mind it, for I have always been fond of outdoor activities of all kinds – especially hunting. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>When I began my service as probationer in Mysore, I learnt horse riding and shooting along with my office work. According to the standing order in those days, all Amildars had to learn riding and obtain a certificate of proficiency from the Cavalry Department. A few somehow managed to get these certificates without having mastered it, but it was not always wise. Padmanabha Rao, who took the Civil Service Examination with my batch and placed first, was killed in a riding accident. He was killed when he lost control of a fairly ordinary horse. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">

>I became an accomplished rider and took great pride in my horses. I also bought a Winchester repeating rifle and a Webley and Scott revolver, spending more money than I could really afford at the time. Some people who disliked exerting themselves would sometimes try to avoid traveling by horseback if they could. But this could backfire on them as in the following episode involving Sparkes himself and an Amildar who could not ride. </SPAN

>After my lunch, I made inquiries regarding the chaotic situation that was prevailing earlier in the afternoon. I learnt that three seers of rice and other provisions were brought from the choultry to prepare food for all of us. It made me furious. The choultry is a public facility, maintained at government expense as a service to visitors from out of town. It is not something to be used for entertaining taluk and village officials. I threatened the manager that I would deduct unauthorized expenses from his salary. He told me that he had instructions from the head clerk. The head clerk told me that the Shirastedar had instructed him. And the Shirastedar told me in secret that the departing Amildar – the one whom I had just replaced – had instructed him to have the food prepared for me, not knowing how late it would be before I arrived. So, with the best of intentions the whole thing had been mismanaged. Not so rare an occurrence. </SPAN

>Ballakki Seena intrigued me. ‘Ballakki’ means two seers of rice, or more than four pounds. He had been awarded the title because of his capacity to consume that much rice (with sambar, curds, etc) at one sitting. This is easily four times the portion of a normal healthy man. I have read somewhere that men who cause destruction on a massive scale become more famous than those who create and bring happiness to the world. I had heard that there were prize winning farmers who could grow twenty-five pallas of rice an acre, but this required land, fertilizer, and hard work. But Seena could single-handedly destroy this harvest in a matter of months, without turning a hair. I sent for him. </SPAN

>It must have been one of his ‘more days,’ with the choultry staff having to themselves all the food cooked for my family and the party. The situation was far from satisfactory. Seena was a choultry servant, nominally an employee, but did little work beyond eating. To allot two seers of rice to feed this one man meant running the choultry solely for his benefit. No household could afford to employ him as a servant because of his cavernous appetite. In addition, he had no skills. In these ancient charitable institutions called choultries, men like him were like pests who destroyed provisions. </SPAN

Finally, I gave instructions that the choultry should get as much work out of the man as possible and give him half a seer of rice a day. It still meant twice a normal man’s ration. He could do additional work and earn more if he wanted. This was regarded as a very hard ruling on my part. </SPAN

I knew intimately its people – and understood their ways and their problems. There were few families in the taluk that I did not know; those that had not seen me were fewer still.

>Yedatore is now called Krishnarajanagara. It is not just the name that has changed, but the whole landscape and environment. To old timers like me, it has changed beyond recognition. As the name indicates, Yedatore stood on the left bank of the river. There were houses on both sides of the main road. The river flowed behind the row of houses on the right side of the road. At the west end of the town, on the river stood the Arkeshwara Temple, adjacent to the bathing ghat. (See photo on page 62). It is no exaggeration to say that the temple was the heart of the town. At the other end of the town were the Traveler’s Bungalow and the Taluk Office. When I first saw Yedatore, it brought to my mind the vision of an old and infirm man who at one time was wealthy and had enjoyed a full and prosperous life. It had a reputation of being malarial and unhealthy. The previous Amildar had fallen ill and moved to the village of Hampapur, about a mile and a half from Yedatore. I too lived in Hampapur for quite some time. </SPAN

Terms like ‘good village’ or ‘troublesome village’ had real meaning. Each village had leaders who enjoyed the trust and affection of the local people. Most disputes were settled locally –  before the village elders. Any disputes and differences between villages used to come to the attention of the Amildar.

I recall one incident in such a village, which was located on the river dividing our state from a British province (I was not the Amildar of the taluk containing the village.) When the Amildar was camping in the area, some villagers came and complained to him about a terrible menace. A scoundrel would cross the boundary and try to molest lonely women on our side working in the fields. He would then cross the river and escape into British territory and evade our law. This distressed the Amildar greatly. He suggested to the villagers to somehow catch and bring the culprit to him, and he would punish the man suitably. He heard nothing more about the incident. When he camped again in the village a couple of months later, he asked about the problem. </SPAN

After executing him, they threw his body into the river, which was then in full spate. There was no trace of him, nor any evidence relating to the incident. Had they brought him to court, it would be months before any judgment could be obtained. Decent women would be forced to give evidence and face unpleasant questions from lawyers. The criminal would probably have got off with a minor sentence. What the villagers did was decidedly against the law, but I have not the courage to say it was against justice. </SPAN

It was unusual for an Englishman to be serving in the Mysore Maharaja’s Government at that time, for the administration was entirely in Indian hands (Some English coffee planters of Hassan and Chikmagalur District had appealed to the Maharaja through the British Resident that only an Englishman should be their Deputy Commissioner. Sparkes, then manager of a coffee estate, had been appointed to the post. He had been transferred to Mysore district as DC for a year or so before he retired. Kantha Raje Urs succeeded him.) There were officials like him during the British Commission rule; there were none before the Commission, there are none now, and there will never again be any in the future. Sparkes and others like him appeared for a fleeting period in the history of our ancient land as the result of a historical accident. They have vanished without a trace and I want to preserve for posterity the memory of the species.

He could be counted upon to go all out to help those who were in his good graces.

It sent me into a cold fury, and my revulsion at his behavior made me almost feverish. In my one year in the Government, my dealings had been with gentlemen and aristocrats like V.V.

>By the time we were ready for our evening circuit, Sparkes' horse had not yet arrived from Mysore. He suggested that we go on our inspection on bicycles and asked me if I could ride one and that slowly. I told him I could and borrowed the police jemadar's bicycle. As we set forth on our bicycles, the streets were filled to overflowing with people. Even the balconies of houses were filled with women and children trying to catch a glimpse of the white man. Mysore, though technically a ‘subsidiary state’ of the British Empire, it was ruled by the Maharaja, and the people had no direct contact with the British. Europeans were an extremely rare sight in the villages, and many had never seen one. This had given rise to the most outlandish theories to explain their origins and dominance in the world at the time. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>At the same time, it is important to recognize that the anti-colonial sentiment prevalent in the world today had not yet taken root in Mysore, or even in much of India. For the better part of four centuries, Mysore had been a feudal kingdom, acknowledging first the Vijaynagar Emperor as overlord, and now the British had taken the place of Vijaynagar. It would be something of an anachronism to attribute any anti-colonial sentiments to the Maharaja's subjects; they simply had no conception of being a colony. They were for the most part perfectly happy with the Maharaja's rule and the nationalist movement never made much headway in Mysore. In fact, the subjects regarded the Wodeyar ruling house with great love and devotion, as will become increasingly clear during the course of my narrative. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The common people therefore had only a vague notion that their own ruler was subordinate to the ‘big’ king or queen in England, and that white men were somehow privileged rulers all over the world. Some people sought explanation for this in our history and mythology. Lord Rama, according to the Indian epic the ‘Ramayana’, was assisted in his conquests by an army of monkeys led by the hero Hanuman. One school of thought held that the power and wealth of Englishmen was due to the grace of Lord Rama whom their ancestors had served as monkey warriors. Their red faces were proof enough of their ancestry; and their antics when angry lent further support to the theory of Englishmen as descendants of apes. It was also believed by those subscribing to this school of thought, that every white man still retained a rudimentary tail growth that proclaims his origins. And an educated few, who had just been exposed to the basics of Darwin's Theory of Evolution, claimed they now had scientific proof of their theory. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The more scholarly among the people pooh-poohed such explanations and looked to the other great epic, the Mahabharata for an explanation. Europeans are the same as Afghans, so went this school, for some Afghans too have red faces, light eyes, and brown hair. According to these scholars, Arjuna, a hero of the ‘Mahabharata’, had Europeans in his army when he had fought against Gandhara, as Afghanistan was then known. Impressed by their valor, he settled some of them in Gandhara as a reward for their service. </SPAN

>With this extraordinary pedigree, it is hardly surprising that Sparkes was such a star attraction to the villagers. To top it, this red-faced man was riding a bicycle! Bicycles were then rarer than helicopters today, and to the villagers, it was like going to the circus and watching a bear ride a bicycle. While we were entertaining the villagers in this fashion, Sparkes came across a sight that he very likely never saw again in his life. I had not planned it as part of his visit; but it is an amusing story nevertheless, that was not without some beneficial results. Here is the gist of it. </SPAN

All too often, whenever we had a meeting of bipeds in the taluk office, there would be a competing meeting of these noisy quadrupeds just outside, sometimes forcing us to shout at the top of our voices, just to make ourselves heard over the din created by their communal braying. </SPAN

>These pests would not allow any vegetable or flower garden to be grown. I considered organizing a volunteer party to shoot these creatures, but no one wanted any part of it; though our people like hunting, no one – me included – cared to shoot these tame animals. It was no use tying them up, for nobody would come forward to claim them. We tried auctioning them, but there were no bidders. Then a possible solution to the problem came to me in a flash. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Shortly after assuming charge, I was going over the catalogue of a company called T.A. Ponnu and Company of Madras. The company supplied light transportation and hauling equipment to city municipalities. As I was leafing through their catalogue, I came across a listing describing a small cart that could be used for hauling trash and other light loads. It struck me that these could be drawn by donkeys; it would be novel – we would get our work done, and the evasive owners also might come forward to claim their animals. With this arrangement, the animals would now become more valuable and be better taken care of, and hopefully stop being such pests. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>With this in mind, I picked out a dozen of these animals, selecting those that seemed fittest to me and announced a public auction. No one came. The city bought them with nominal bids. I had rope and leather harnesses made for them, and also had the animals trained which was easy enough. Within a few days, the transformation of these creatures was remarkable; they looked as different from stray animals as a uniformed policeman does from a street vagabond. The scheme worked well, with fewer stray donkeys in the streets, and the city also had an efficient and inexpensive means of hauling trash and other light loads. We had four such carts. As we were making our rounds, Sparkes and I came across two of them. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I next want to introduce one of the most remarkable men I have ever known, and the strongest personality in those parts at the time – Patel Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama. Patel is the chief of a village, a hereditary office. Devarsay Gowda was the Patel of an affluent and historic old village known as Saligrama. In those days, Mysore was over three-quarters rural; my taluk of Yedatore for instance had over sixty villages. Because of limited communications, towns and villages then used to be much more self sufficient than they are today. As a result, some village chiefs had grown to wield considerable influence and authority. One or two of them, through their force of character, initiative, and leadership qualities commanded the kind of recognition accorded to local chieftains a century ago. In my experience, the person who best exemplified the kind of stature that a Patel could attain to was Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama. It is my firm belief that had he been born a couple of centuries earlier, he would have been the founder of a ruling dynasty. As it was, he was like an uncrowned king in those parts. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The fact that the Patel's office was hereditary had left Mysore society with an unusual feature. The Maharaja and the Patel, who occupied the highest and the lowest levels of authority in the realm, did so by hereditary right; all other officials were civil servants. Another key village official – the Shanbog – was also usually, but not always, a hereditary appointment. The Shanbog had the responsibility for maintaining the village accounts and also for tax records. The Patel of a village invariably came from the farming or the Vokkaliga caste, while the Shanbog was usually a Brahmin. Both men were considered leaders of the village community, with this important difference: the Shanbog </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>was a professional bookkeeper, while the Patel, depending on his personal qualities, was often seen as a nobleman. And Patel Devarsay Gowda was most emphatically a nobleman. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>During my two years as Amildar of Yedatore, I saw a good deal of Devarsay Gowda. It has been nearly fifty years since I last set my eyes on the man, but his personality is as vivid in my memory as yesterday. There was nothing small about the man; his virtues – he had many – and his faults were equally on a grand scale. His generosity knew no bounds. He could never say ‘no’ to anyone who came to him for help, and that in the end was to prove his downfall. That is a different story that I am reserving for a later time. For the present, I just want to place him in the milieu in which I found him. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Kaveri flows in a west to east direction, bisecting Yedatore taluk in two. To the north of the river lie the affluent villages of Mirley, Saligrama, and Bhairya. These villages are the stronghold of the farming or the Vokkaliga caste, and many wealthy farmers used to live in them. Downstream from these villages, where the Hemavati flows into the Kaveri, lie several villages in which lived many Brahmins; some of them quite wealthy with large land holdings. In those days, Brahmins were influential in those parts. But the strongest personality in the whole region – among Brahmins and Vokkaligas alike – was Devarsay Gowda, Patel of Saligrama. And this owed nothing to wealth. He was neither rich nor poor. I knew landowners, traders, moneylenders, and others in places like Saligrama and Mirley who were ten times as rich. During the course of my career as a public official, it has fallen to my lot to be associated with important people in India as well as in Europe – with rulers, diplomats, political leaders, and captains of industry. But if wealth were measured in terms of commanding presence, personal magnetism, force of character and qualities of leadership – and not just material possessions – I can count on the fingers of one hand the persons I have known who could hold a candle to Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I knew him by reputation well before coming to Yedatore as Amildar. As the Patel of a town in my taluk charge, he was of course my subordinate; but his was a hereditary office, and his family had associations with the people of the area going back to times </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>immemorial. No civil servant could hope to match his heritage. Whatever dignity the Amildar possessed was reflected glory – as the appointed representative of the Maharaja – and what he himself could command with his own qualities. To our people those days, how well a particular official upheld the proud history and traditions of the land meant much more than what procedures and rules he followed; to them he was a ruler first and foremost who embodied the Maharaja's trust and justice. An official who grasped this essential fact could make quite an impact. Patel Devarsay Gowda was a born leader, a ruler par excellence who fully embodied this essence, though his comprehension was elemental and intuitive rather than calculated. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>As I was about to take charge, I was warned that the Gowda's power and influence greatly exceeded his official position; that he was more a local chieftain than a subordinate official. He was reportedly a man who cared for no one. He was also said to have humiliated a previous high official – an Amildar no less – by parading him seated facing backwards on a donkey, decked in a crown, and garlands made from old shoes. I was warned to be on my guard. Naturally, I was curious to meet him. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Actually, he paid me a visit in my office only the day after I took charge. He made a highly favorable first impression on me. He was a man of commanding presence, over six feet in height, which seemed even greater with the large turban that he was never seen without. He always had a dark gray or black shawl thrown around his shoulders. He was of powerful build with broad shoulders, but now in his senior years his body inclining to stoutness. His complexion was dark – almost black. He had fine large eyes that always looked you straight in the eye and a sharply chiseled aquiline nose over magnificent, sweeping, scimitar-shaped gray moustaches. A painter or a sculptor looking for a model for a Rajput warrior of yore or an epic hero need have looked no further than this aristocrat of the soil. </SPAN

While he did not have much by the way of formal education, he had a natural way with words and spoke well. He greeted me with the respect due to my official position, but without a trace of obsequiousness – respect mixed with a certain </SPAN

As the descendant of a family used to leadership for generations, he had an unconscious and totally unaffected air of authority, and seemed by instinct to know how exactly to conduct himself in every situation – the trait of a born nobleman. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Not many days after this meeting, I had occasion to learn personally of his leadership qualities and his way with people. His village of Saligrama had a problem with fresh water, especially during the dry season. A few years prior to my taking charge, Patel Devarsay Gowda had appealed to the Government through the then Amildar to sanction funds for a fresh water reservoir for his town. As proposed, this facility would draw water from the Kaveri canal, which would then be filtered to supply drinking water to the residents of Saligrama. The Government had approved the project, but required the town to come up with half the money, with the remainder to be provided by the state. It was estimated that Saligrama would first have to raise six thousand rupees on its own, with the Government then contributing an equal amount. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Four years had passed since the Government had given its approval; in the meantime nothing had come of it. Despite taking personal charge of it, two previous Amildars had failed repeatedly in their attempts to coax the needed amount from the residents of Saligrama. Finally, the Government sent a reminder warning that the money set aside for the project had lapsed for the fourth straight year, and if Saligrama failed again to come up with its share of the funds, the Government would transfer its share to some other project where it might be put to better use. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

I had to finalize some of the town's revenue accounts also which meant I could attend to two tasks on a single visit. It was my first visit to Saligrama – a historic old village. More than a hundred persons had lined up in front of the Traveler's Bungalow to greet me. There were a few taluk and village clerks also present to help me with the revenue work. As soon as I crossed the town boundary, my trumpeters announced me with a couple of blasts, and </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I was received by the village elders – a Brahmin priest by name Chennappayana Krishnappa, the Jain Kubera Shetty, who was the chief of the town merchant guild, by Hanuma Gowda, a leader of the dominant Vokkaliga community, and of course Devarsay Gowda. Jains are a reform Hindu sect who in those days were mostly engaged in trade and money lending. Shetty or Setty is the caste title used by the merchant or the Vaishya caste, just as Gowda is used by Vokkaligas.

Then Krishnappa, in a Sanskrit verse of his own composition, compared me to Bhagiratha – the legendary hero of Hindu mythology who after many struggles finally succeeds in bringing the life-giving Ganges River from the Himalayan peaks to the plains of India.

I have always lived honorably. This town is my heart and my soul. My family has served the people of this town for hundreds of years. We have been loyal servants of the Maharajas for generations.

That place belongs to you as a Brahmin and a teacher. You have taught everyone of us in this town— you are our Guru. You bathe, worship, and pray in the temple every day for our welfare. You have need for water more than any of us. Then there are business community leaders – Mr. Kubera Shetty, Bagarajiah, Adirajiah, and others. My name should follow theirs. They will all make generous contributions I'm sure. And Mr. Hanuma Gowda here – a fellow Gowda like me – is a wealthy man. He'll give at least a thousand— when a small farmer like me has given five hundred. Am I not right, Mr. Hanumaiah?&quot; </SPAN

>Hanuma Gowda's demeanor as he announced his contribution gave every indication that he was parting with that kind of money for the first time in his life. Krishnappa gave a thousand, and the Jain and other merchants present each gave five hundred rupees if I remember correctly; a few may have given more. Within a few hours, just from this group of village leaders, we had collected nearly all the money necessary. This was an extraordinarily impressive performance of persuasion by Devarsay Gowda, considering that two previous Amildars had failed to make any headway. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I was especially struck by the willingness of the Jain merchants to support the project, for they had a well-deserved reputation for being notoriously tightfisted. Even though many of them owned land, their principal vocation and source of income was money lending at </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>exorbitant rates of interest. What land they did own was acquired through foreclosures of mortgaged property from delinquent owners. As a result, these merchants did not work their land, but hired landless laborers of the Vokkaliga caste as tenant farmers. So, these moneylenders were not exactly public-spirited men known for their concern for the well being of their fellow citizens. I felt that there must have been some other reason lurking behind their uncharacteristic generosity. With a few discreet enquiries I learnt how Devarsay Gowda had managed to bring them around and gain their support. Here is the story. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>These Jain merchants owned hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands around Saligrama, irrigated by the Kaveri canal. Not being farmers themselves, they leased their lands to tenant farmers, some of whom were former owners who had lost title to their lands to these merchants through foreclosures. A few years before I came to Yedatore as Amildar – in the year 1903 I believe – crops had failed due to a drought causing the canal to run dry, blight, or some other reason. This resulted in a severe shortfall in what the cultivators could pay their owners. Naturally, they requested a postponement. The owners refused. Devarsay Gowda, as the Patel and also as the leader of the Vokkaliga community to which nearly all these cultivators belonged, tried to persuade the owners to compromise on payments pointing out that the condition had been brought on by a natural disaster. He even agreed to stand personal surety for the farmers until the situation could be restored following a normal harvest. The crop failure had been so severe that even if the farmers were to hand over everything they had grown, they would still be short of their contract obligations. But these rapacious owners who knew nothing about farming refused any compromise, and wanted the farmers to sell their family jewels and other personal belongings to meet their contract payments. This was too much for the Gowda. He decided to break the owners' arrogance once and for all. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Devarsay Gowda saw that the most effective way of dealing with these merchants was to exploit their weakness – their complete lack of any farming skills. But first he had to take care of the farmers in distress. He found employment for as many of the dispossessed farmers as he could on his own and his kinsmen's lands. He then visited other </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>landowners in the taluk – both fellow Vokkaligas and Brahmins – to provide temporary employment for these cultivators. The high regard in which the Gowda was held, combined with the universal distaste for the moneylenders and their methods, made his task easy. He also appealed to the Government to start some public works projects, and again persuaded his wealthy friends to bid for contracts and employ the remaining farmers. Within a few months, most of the dispossessed farmers had been taken care of. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Moneylenders are never popular anywhere, and these men deserved all the odium that was heaped on them. Devarsay Gowda found the existing situation, with moneylenders in ownership of the farms also highly unsatisfactory and decided the only way of improving the lot of the farmers was to break their grip on the farm economy once and for all. He went to the owners and told them that all their tenant farmers had found alternate employment, and that their own lands would be left fallow. This was only the beginning. He then told them that he had enough influence with the people in the area, as well as with the Government to ensure that no one would cultivate their lands for as long as necessary to make them see reason. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>These moneylenders were now in desperate straits. They had all this land they didn't know how to work, and also the tax bills, capital equipment, seed, manure, farm animals, land and canal use and maintenance fees and a hundred other chores that come with land ownership, all adding up to a huge drain on their resources. And without farmers to borrow money, their main source of income – money lending </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Ever after this brush with disaster, they treated Devarsay Gowda with utmost respect and took care to be on the right side of him. The memory of this was still fresh in their minds and explained their willingness to follow the Gowda's lead. Even though he was respectful towards these merchants in the public meeting, it would not surprise me if the Gowda had met with them beforehand in private for some gentle arm twisting. The remarkable thing in the whole episode is the Gowda’s concern for the people, he asked nothing for himself. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I don't recall now what became of the project; the money we had raised was handed over to the Government, but the bureaucracy moved at its own pace. Nothing had been done in the following two years when I was Amildar of Yedatore. It must have been completed later, for I hear that Saligrama now has excellent water supply. And the citizens of that fair town can thank their great Patel whose leadership and intelligence made it possible. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>During the two years and a half that I had to deal with him, my experience as his Amildar left me ambivalent about Devarsay Gowda. He was obviously an exceptionally able and resourceful leader. Also, whenever called upon, he served me with intelligence and diligence. He was also very useful to me in a famous jewel robbery investigation that I will relate in the next chapter. He was courageous, loyal, highly intelligent and an outstanding leader who could always be trusted to help those in distress. At the same time, people kept cautioning me that the man was something of a law unto himself who stopped at nothing – that he was often involved in crimes and used his power and influence to intimidate witnesses in the courts. At first I assumed that these were only rumors spread by persons envious of his talent and influence. There was certainly a good deal of that, but the charges against him, though exaggerated, were not without substance. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Over a period of time, I began to see that his qualities were mixed. If there was one thing that characterized Devarsay Gowda, it was loyalty; loyalty to those who acknowledged his leadership would be given unquestioningly, regardless of consequences. His infinite capacity to overlook any flaw or action on the part of any of his dependents was probably the dominant trait in his character. This was compounded by an overweening vanity that led him at times to place himself above the law. He was proud of his ability to protect the interests of those he regarded his followers, no matter what. And if he happened to regard someone as an enemy, that man would be destroyed. It was at least what a lot of people believed and warned me about. </SPAN

>He was reputed to have under him a band of a dozen or so men as his personal bodyguards prepared to undertake any assignment. These men were said to intimidate town merchants and buy whatever they pleased on credit, making payments as and when they pleased. It was also believed that Devarsay Gowda could help resolve any dispute or win a fight anywhere in the area by sending his men to the party requesting his aid. Many villagers firmly believed that if they wanted anything done by the Government, having Devarsay Gowda on their side was the best way of getting it done. </SPAN

>Much of this was hearsay; if he managed to get things in the Government it was because he was able and intelligent, and was held in high regard by the authorities. But there were things I had heard that could not be easily overlooked. I heard of instances in which the Gowda was said to have taken the side of defendants in government lawsuits, and had actually succeeded in having the cases dismissed by silencing government witnesses through intimidation. These charges, if true, were clear violations of the law; as Patel he worked for the Government and it was his duty to uphold and enforce the law of the land. After receiving this intelligence, I decided to have a frank talk with him, even though I didn't have any evidence against him. I sent for him to see me and first briefed him about the charges. </SPAN

>In another case involving a land dispute, some men had been charged with forcing themselves upon the property and severely beating the owner; they were said to be set upon by Devarsay Gowda to go to the aid of one of the parties. The case was tried before me, and a famous lawyer was brought from Mysore to represent them. In his closing argument, the lawyer dropped a broad hint to the effect that his clients were honorable men known to Patel Devarsay Gowda. Those present in the audience gave me an expectant look, trying to read my reaction. Ignoring the remark, I read my judgment awarding a fairly stiff sentence, pointedly noting that the evidence against the accused men was very strong. </SPAN

>&quot;Sir, you are a good man with a bright future ahead of you. You have a wife and small children to take care of. Please don't act hastily. This taluk is a den of thieves. These people will think nothing of humiliating you in public. They once paraded a taluk official tied to a donkey and decked in old shoes. They won't hesitate for a moment to use force against you if they think it will serve their purpose. Your life may be in danger.&quot; </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Some other letters contained direct threats – with no pretense of any goodwill. They gave a graphic description of what sort of fate might be in store for me should I choose to provoke these people with my arrogance of power. These also mentioned crowns and garlands of shoes, donkey rides, threats of injury, and worse. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This was too much. The style and language of the letters suggested a single source for both kinds of letters. I sensed that Patel Devarsay Gowda must have a hand in the whole thing, and decided that I would sooner or later have to confront him. There was never the slightest doubt about the rightness of my course of action. To allow myself to be swayed by them would be an act of cowardice and a betrayal of myself and the Government whose law I was sworn to uphold. I wanted an opportunity to make it clear to the Gowda and anyone else that may have been involved, that my resolve was firm and they could never hope to bend me to serve their needs. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>At the same time, I treated their threats seriously and took some precautionary steps. With the help of the police I prepared a list of all those individuals reputed to belong to the band of Devarsay Gowda's henchmen. I also instituted the following measures for my personal security. I would always carry a loaded revolver and never go anywhere on foot in public without a bodyguard – my orderly Sheikh Mohaddin and a couple of taluk servants. Whenever I went for a walk, it was always in the company of some friends. I really did not believe I was in any physical danger; I also felt that with all the precautions I had taken, I was fully capable of defending myself. In fact, in the confidence of youth, I even looked forward to a challenge. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>In the meantime, a complaint had been lodged against a man from Saligrama known as Pataki, which in Kannada means ‘firecracker’. His real name I believe was Boray Gowda and he was reputed to be one of Devarsay Gowda's men. He was a son of Hanuma Gowda – the wealthy landowner of Saligrama whom we have already met. In spite of being born into a respectable family, this Pataki liked to associate with undesirable characters. He had been charged with creating a disturbance at the santhe by assaulting someone repeatedly with a shoe. The victim was a son-in-law or some other relative of Devarsay Gowda, but for some reason the two families had become estranged. I saw the victim, and the sores and bruises on his body left no doubt that he had received a severe beating. In this tangled web of animosities, it was unclear where exactly Devarsay Gowda stood. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>As I was about to begin hearings in this case, the same pattern of threatening letters was repeated, except their tone seemed to be more ominous. A highly respected farmer from Mirley paid me a visit and </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>cautioned me about the potential risks. He advised me to transfer the case to a different court pointing out that I was in a no-win situation: I would be criticized if he were let off, but place myself in danger if I found him guilty. I asked him how he knew about the dangers. He said that people were openly talking about it, and in fact, he was there to warn me at the behest of several of my well-wishers concerned for my safety. I thanked him, but told him that it had only strengthened my resolve to act in a manner worthy of their affection. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The case came up for hearing. A team of well-known lawyers from Mysore came and defended the accused. But the prosecution was able to establish Pataki's guilt and I sentenced him to three months of hard labor. After the sentencing, as I was coming out of the court, I caught sight of Devarsay Gowda as he was about to disappear around a corner. I called out his name and invited him to accompany me to the Traveler's Bungalow. I decided this was as good a time as any to have a frank talk with him. I still had no evidence against him; all I had were my suspicions. The best way of dealing with him, I felt, was to be completely frank. The Patel's own pride and sense of honor would never allow him to be evasive. He must also have been curious, and possibly, also a little apprehensive. His face was covered with sweat. </SPAN

Besides, I always carry a loaded revolver – just to be sure. Six men must drop before anyone can lay a hand on me. I have heard of your exploits – of humiliating an Amildar with donkey rides and garlands of shoes. If that is to be my reward for faithfully executing my sworn duties, I'll consider it an honor. But mark this – if anything should happen to me, I have left enough records on you and your men to destroy everyone of you.

In these parts, people invoke my name in all sorts of things without ever telling me. Am I to be blamed for every act that ruffians of this town perpetrate? Judge me by what I do, but don't be influenced by everything you hear about me. If you find any evidence of wrongdoing, punish me all you want, but don't be swayed by rumors. There's nothing I can do about them.&quot; </SPAN

I also began to suspect that he probably did not have as much control over the conduct of his men as people believed. At the very least he could be depended upon to convey my warning to his men, I felt. Still, I felt I owed him an explanation for our meeting. In an attempt to be conciliatory, I stood up and put an arm on his shoulder. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>&quot;Mr. Gowda, sir,&quot; I told him, &quot;I bear you no ill-will, I assure you. On the other hand, I have great respect and even admiration for your qualities. But it disturbs me to see so much disorderliness and open contempt for the law. This taluk has a bad reputation. Leaders like you must assist servants of the land like me in upholding the Maharaja's law.&quot; </SPAN

>He gave his assurance and left. For the remainder of my stay in Yedatore as Amildar, Devarsay Gowda was extraordinarily helpful to me, helping me in several cases. My impression now is that lax administration by previous taluk officials had undermined the rule of law allowing local leaders to fill the resulting power vacuum. Then just before I was to leave Yedatore for another taluk, I myself had to arrest Devarsay Gowda in a dramatic riot and murder case, famous in those days (1907) as the Bidirakka Riot. It is a story that I have reserved for a later time. </SPAN

So we borrowed some jewelry and fine clothes from some friends and relatives for her to wear. It was nearly midnight when the festivities ended, and my daughter was exhausted and ready to go to bed. She complained that all the jewels and the heavy, gold-braided silk sari she was wearing were making her very tired. We told her to be a little patient, and at about one-thirty we removed her sari and the jewelry off of her, put them in a cane basket, and placed it on a wooden chair in a room where four or five of us women were to sleep. The men were sleeping in the hall outside, and we shut the door. We had no reason to be suspicions. We were so exhausted, that we fell asleep in no time at all, though the men outside kept on talking for quite some time. We were fast asleep until awakened by the usual morning trumpet blast from the temple. </SPAN

They soon started arguing saying, ‘How could a thief enter a house full of people? You must have misplaced it somewhere. Try to remember where exactly you put the jewels,’ and so on. In the meantime, my brother had informed the police and the inspector came with a sergeant, and a writer.” </SPAN

They began to whisper among themselves and finally a few of them came and said to me, ‘Look, Subbamma! We are not wealthy people. We loaned it to you in good faith. You should try and remember where exactly you put them and return them to us. Why bring in the police, the courts and all that? Just tell us where you kept the jewels.’ </SPAN

They then whispered to themselves in Urdu [the inspector and a constable were both Muslims] and said to me, ‘Very clever!

They are all good people.’ The inspector said, ‘Yes, we know. Your brother is a truthful fellow. We will make him talk,’ and took him to the station.

It was also according to the rules, as any case involving more than five hundred or thousand rupees, I don’t remember which, was called a ‘heinous’ offence, and the law required the Amildar to take personal charge of it. Besides, why be reticent: I was also concerned that this gentle, unworldly couple might get rough treatment by the police. I got my ox-cart yoked and ready and asked her to get in.

>What next? I had to somehow improvise. I got my helpers to draw up a plan of the house and explored every corner of it using a magnifying glass – a la Sherlock Holmes. It led to nothing. I sent the list of stolen goods to all the police stations in the area, and also gave secret instructions to keep a close eye on the movements of all the known criminals in the area, with orders to report to me any recent unusual activity on their part. I also sent instructions to keep an eye on any large transactions at any of the goldsmiths or jewelry shops. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This seemed to bear fruit. At first I first received reports that all of the known regular criminal personalities – Ramalinga, Pataki, Shamba, and others were in their villages, none having shown any recent signs of unusual activity or new ventures. But soon I also got a report that a notorious thief called Tandrey Linga had left his home village a couple of months or so ago, and his present whereabouts were unknown. For two weeks, I received nothing more of him and the trail seemed to have gone cold. Then a report from the police outpost in a village called Bhairya came with the information that “A known felon by name Tandrey Linga was involved in a fracas at the village fair and beat up a few people. He has been arrested and kept in police custody for questioning.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Later, I learnt the truth from the village Shanbog. Tandrey Linga was no ordinary thief, but a local godfather. If he took a dislike for any man, that poor man’s livestock died mysteriously, and fires appeared in his barn. Besides, in the colorful language of the Bhairya police sergeant, Linga was a ‘Rangucora’ meaning he was violence prone, whom, even a few prison terms had failed to reform. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The story of his first imprisonment is extraordinary, and gives an idea of his daring and opportunism. It happened thus. There was a young supervisor in the Public Works Department or ‘sub-overseer’ as he was then known, living in Yedatore. He was recently married to a very beautiful girl and they were an affectionate couple. One day, as he was leaving for work he said to his wife, “The Director of Public Works (DPW) is coming to inspect the new extension. He will be camping at the site there today. I may have to stay there for the night, but I’ll try to come back. I can leave early again tomorrow on my bicycle and be there at the site on time.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:22px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>“I’ll probably be late,” he replied. “There is no need to wait up for me. Just leave the front door unlocked. I’ll let myself in.” </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Tandrey Linga, who happened to be nearby happened to overhear this conversation. His nimble mind sensed an opportunity. He followed the young supervisor to the place where the extension work was being done. He mixed with the people who were there to see the DPW Sahib at the Traveler’s Bungalow. He soon learnt that the Sahib had invited his subordinates to dine with him, and estimated that the sub-overseer would not be able to leave before eleven at the earliest. This, Linga thought, would give him enough time to carry out a plan he had hatched. Linga returned to Yedatore immediately. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Taluk villages are typically quiet by nine or so. In those days before electricity came to the villages, there were only some kerosene lamps in the streets that were too dim to do much more than show up the darkness. I have been out at that time to check on the diligence of the beat policeman. Whenever I went early, the police would tell me that they had not yet started their beat; if I went later, they would claim they just left to report at the police station. Once in a while, when I encountered a policeman on his beat, he would pretend that he had not seen me, and create such a frightful din with his whistle and his stick, that it made me feel thankful for my vocation – Subedar and not a thief. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>To return to the main story, Tandrey Linga came back to the village and went straight to the sub-overseer’s house. As he had anticipated, the door was not locked and he entered the house. He saw the man’s wife sleeping, in the light of a small oil lamp set on a wooden bench. He saw that she was wearing a gold necklace and some bangles also of gold. He reflected on his course. Fortunately, he was only a robber and not a morally depraved man. He did not think either of killing her or molesting her, but only wanted her jewelry. He gagged her with the bedcover, and overpowering the woman, took away her jewelry. Once his job was done, he made a dash for the door. This, of course, took a few minutes. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The activity and the muffled screams of the victim set the street dogs barking. As he came out of the house, he collided head on with a man trying to come in through the door. This man fell on Linga and forced him to the ground. As Linga was struggling to free himself the woman came out, threw her blanket – the same one that the thief had used to overpower her – on both the men, and roused the neighborhood with her cries. The neighbors came in and apprehended Linga. The sub-overseer had asked the Sahib’s permission to leave immediately after dinner, returning an hour earlier than what Linga had calculated. This, and the resourcefulness of the brave woman, had upset Linga’s plan and led to his arrest. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>My first meeting with Tandrey Linga is also etched in my memory, but first I need to give you a little background. Saligrama is a prosperous village in Yedatore taluk, and used to be a centre of trade and money lending business in those days. As a result government mail runners </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>covering the postal route often carried hundreds of rupees in their mailbags from money orders originating in Saligrama. A section of this route, running from Saligrama to Arkalgood, had to pass through a valley that was deserted much of the time. Postal carriers often had to negotiate this stretch at night. There was some other traffic also, carrying goods and money. Numerous thefts and robberies along this road had given it a bad name. As Linga’s village Tandrey lay just on the side of this route, it was thought that he was the ringleader of a band of thieves, and controlled these activities. The taluk, the district, and even the Diwan’s office, began to receive anonymous letters alerting that Linga was hatching a plan to loot the postal runners’ bags, and even the revenue couriers who had to negotiate this route. As this road lay in my taluk, it fell to my charge to take every precaution to forestall Linga’s depredations. So, I made every effort to keep a vigilant eye on him, but he managed to elude efforts by the police to meet him. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This was what led to my first meeting with Linga, which came about as follows. One day, shortly after taking charge of the taluk, I stopped at Tandrey on the way to Saligrama from Anakanahalli, hoping to surprise him. I went up to the Patel and asked him if Linga was in town.  </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>“Yes, that is his house,” the Patel said to me, pointing to a small house. “That woman there is his wife.”  </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I went up to the woman and asked her where I could find Linga. She told me that he was in the field. I wondered what on earth he was doing in the field, when he had his vocation of crime as his gold mine. I rode on, accompanied by the Patel and a few others. The Patel pointed to a man bent over, working in the field, and said, “My lord, that’s Linga.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:22px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The man didn’t even stand up to greet me as was expected in those days, when receiving a king’s official. Without even looking up, he said, “I have nothing to say to the Amildar. I see no reason come to him. Let him come here if he wants to talk to me.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>He continued looking at me with his insolent expression and a small scythe in his hand. He was clearly showing off in front of the Patel and other villagers who were already in fear of him. I felt that if I let a notorious felon like this get away with such behavior, I would never be able to command any respect in this unruly taluk, and the Government’s authority would be undermined. If I were to swallow this humiliation in public view of the Patel and other villagers, they would be justified in believing that I, like the rest them, lived in fear of Linga. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I was then a strong young man, and always carried a loaded revolver in my pocket. I resolved to break his insolence. I rode up to him, and gave him a couple of lashes with my horsewhip, saying, “Take that for your insolence.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>He grabbed the bridle of my horse with his left hand and raised his scythe with his right hand, as if to strike me. I don’t know if he intended to strike me or was just trying to scare me, but I gave him no time to act. I pulled the revolver out of my pocket, aimed it at his arm and shouted, “Drop your weapon, or I’ll blow your arm off.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Patel and the other men started shouting, asking him to drop his weapon. He dropped it immediately. As I recall now, the revolver hammer was not cocked, but they had no way of knowing it. I gave him another thrashing, and sent him over to the police station with my orderly, the Patel and an armed guard. There he was interrogated about the allegations. By this time, the readers will have recognized that Tandrey Linga was no ordinary thief. </SPAN

>“Tandrey Linga came here at noon,” he told me, “and asked for lunch. There was no food in the kitchen. He grumbled that all provisions went to feed the choultry’s Brahmin staff, and there was nothing left for visitors like him. I told him, ‘Look, I can give you some provisions, so you can cook a meal for yourself.’ He refused saying, ‘No, thank you. Eat it yourself, and may it all turn into gold in your stomach.’ He then went to the Patel’s house and said to him, ‘I have been away from home for three months. I just came back— walking all the way from Atthiguppe in the hot morning sun. Can you provide some food for me?’ He ate at the Patel’s house and took his leave.” </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Patel confirmed the choultry manager’s account. The story aroused my suspicion. It looked as though Linga had gone to all this trouble mainly to establish that he had come back to Bhairya just that day, after being away for three months. Obviously, the idea was for him to be able to claim that he was far away from Yedatore on the day of the robbery. As I noted earlier, his unruly conduct at the village fair had led to his being taken to the police station, where he had to sign papers to gain his release. This also seemed to me like part of a contrived plan— to give himself an alibi. If my guess was correct, he must have been at some place in the neighborhood on the day of the crime, well before his claimed arrival, which he went such lengths to draw attention to. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The crime had take place in Yedatore, a short distance from Bhairya. If Linga was our man, he could have gone to Mysore the night of the crime to dispose of his stolen goods; or he might have gone to Saligrama, where too there were facilities for their disposal. On second thought, it struck me that Saligrama was the more likely venue, as Linga was bound to have better contacts there, being a local. He might even have returned to his home in Tandrey, deciding to wait it out for a few weeks until the furor had died down and then get rid of the jewels. This meant he must have made the trip from Yedatore to Tandrey soon after the crime. </SPAN

The second, much less frequented, followed the southern bank of the Kaveri to Chunchan Katte. This road had no bridge, and the river had to be crossed near Chunchan Katte.

>This route ran through almost uninhabited country that was totally deserted at night. The first road on the other hand was a busy thoroughfare, and ran by a large wholesale depot right by the bridge, which was guarded at all hours of the day and night. Hampapur lay at the far end of the bridge where I had my own house, at the entrance to the town. Just a few miles out lay Mirley with a police outpost, also situated directly on the road. Linga was a notorious figure and there were many including policemen who knew him by sight. This was the worst possible route for a known felon carrying stolen goods to be taking. It seemed to me, that unless he was a fool, he was bound to have taken the second, more deserted route. </SPAN

I did remember his daring break-in when the sub-overseer was away, but then the house had a single sleeping woman. The wedding night robbery was a totally different proposition. The only possibility seemed to be the presence of an accomplice among the wedding guests. This man and Linga must have been acquainted with each other for a long time. Having the run of </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>No matter what his method, according to my theory, Linga must have crossed the river by boat at a small village called Chikkanayakana Halli on the night of the crime or very early the following morning. There was no other place within miles where he could get a boat. (The Chunchana Katte rapids made crossing virtually impossible at any other place. See photo.) This gave me something to get started. I decided to visit the place and make discreet inquiries of the boatmen who lived there. I also had an excellent assistant, my police inspector. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The inspector, a Muslim officer by name Khaja Mohammed Khan, was a past master at mixing with people and getting information without attracting undue attention. After all these years, I have yet to meet a more capable police officer. He spoke the corrupt Kannada dialect of the Mysorean Muslims of those days: the sounds s, sh, shh – all had the same value in his speech; he would dash away whatever came first to him, both in speech and in writing. I am speaking of course of the early years of this century, and it is no longer true. A great many Muslims speak perfect Kannada today, and many of them have attained distinction as writers. There were far fewer educated Muslims then, and their manner of speech was as I just depicted. His reports also were not distinguished by their literary quality, but were full of sound judgment and good sense based on years of experience. He was an honest and friendly man of impeccable character. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The inspector and I went to Chunchan Katte to investigate if Tandrey Linga had taken this route following the crime. At first we met with disappointment, for no one remembered having seen him recently. This was about a month or so after the theft, so not altogether surprising. There are no hamlets between Yedatore and Chunchan Katte, and I was certain that Linga would have made the journey under the cover of night. Then the inspector talked to the boatmen at the crossing and had better luck. One of them, their leader, knew Tandrey Linga quite well; in fact, they were friends. When asked about when he last saw Linga, he replied, “How do I know sir? Am I a reading man to keep records? It might have been fifteen or twenty days: may be a month. Yes sir, it was more like a month.” </SPAN

I rowed my canoe across to him and said, ‘You are certainly out very early sir.’ He said, ‘Yes, I had to start early. I have some very important work at home. Be a good fellow and keep your mouth shut. Just ferry me across the river.’ As we were about halfway across the river he asked me, ‘Is Appaji in town?’ ‘How should I know?’ I asked back. When we reached the opposite bank, I asked him for the fare. He pulled out a silver rupee coin and asked me if I had change. ‘When do I carry change on me at this time?’ He said, ‘That’s all right! Keep the change. Don’t ever let on to anyone I was here. If you are good, I’ll give you a large reward at the next jatra in Chunchan Katte.’ But I cannot keep this from lordships like you. You want to know if he had anything with him – nothing. No, wait! I remember now. He had something wrapped in a towel, say, a bundle the size of a pumpkin. No, he didn’t put it down. He held it in his hands all the time. How should I know if it was heavy? I didn’t touch it.” </SPAN

He was now practicing his profession in a perfectly legal way, as a law-abiding citizen. From what the boatman and some other villagers told us, he seemed to be acquainted with Linga.

I have made bracelets and a waistband for his wife. I have made other jewelry for some of his other women friends also. Linga is something of a ladies’ man. One morning, about twenty days or so ago, he came to my house looking extremely tired, as if he had been traveling all night. I asked, ‘What brings you here?’ </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

You’ve had a field day hunting.’ ‘Yes, but I’ll end up as the trophy if I get caught. Just do as you are told’.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The same day, the inspector, accompanied by a few village elders as witnesses, escorted Appaji back to his house and recovered the piece of gold given to him by Linga. He also had it appraised before witnesses and took custody of it. This was the first tangible piece of evidence we had in the case, and sufficient to arrest Linga. Also the same day, Linga was picked up in Tandrey where he was home feigning illness. He was brought to the police station in Saligrama and kept in custody in the lock-up. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>We still had a long way to go. Out of the three-and-a-half to four thousand rupees worth of jewelry, we had recovered a miniscule quantity of gold. What was encouraging was that the jewelry described by Appaji as having seen in Linga’s possession matched our list of stolen jewelry. But where was the rest of it? Also, what was Linga’s modus operandi? There was little doubt in our minds that Linga had engineered the robbery, but we had two major tasks still ahead of us: recovery of the stolen goods, and gathering enough evidence for Linga’s conviction. The next day I went to Saligrama to investigate the matter further. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The inspector made a routine investigation based on the few clues we already had. He located the prostitute Kempi, and recovered from her the gold braided silk sari, which had also been missing. We recognized it as the same one that had covered the basket in which the jewels had been placed on the night of the crime. Kempi confirmed that Linga had given her the sari. The poor woman, frightened out of her wits by all this, gave us also the names of several of Linga’s intimates. One of them was Lachmey Gowda, a nephew of Devarsay Gowda, the Patel of Saligrama. The inspector interrogated some of these men. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>These men told the inspector that on the day after the crime, Linga was hiding in Kempi’s house, and passed the time feasting and playing cards with some of his friends. He had been to Tandrey before coming to Saligrama, and his wife had also visited him a few times in Saligrama. Linga was certainly spending money on a lavish scale. We surmised that by now he must have sold one, or possibly both of the gold ingots that Appaji had prepared for him. All our efforts to discover the party to whom he had sold them proved fruitless. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>We next went to his house in Tandrey to talk to his wife. She was a wily woman. She put on an impressive performance – playing an </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>indignant virtuous woman helplessly trying to reform her wayward husband. She was alternately crying and pleading that her husband should be sentenced to a long prison term. “A felon’s wife is always a widow,” she kept saying. We searched the house thoroughly and found nothing except the usual household effects. The inspector was not taken in by her histrionics and described her to me as a 'cunning slut'. We both felt that she was fully involved in the crime as her husband’s accomplice. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Linga remained in police custody. I should tell you that even in custody Linga remained defiant and arrogant and treated the police with supercilious disdain. Unlike most thieves, who are basically simple and humble by nature, Linga affected a superior attitude. The police completely struck out in trying to get Linga to co-operate with them. When I tried to talk to him, he said, “Why don’t you go ahead and hang me? Just don’t leave me in the hands of the police to be tortured.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Our inability to get Linga to reveal anything made us explore other alternatives. One possibility was to get his accomplices to co-operate, willingly or unwittingly. There was a lot of activity around the station house where Linga was being held. Several of them wanted some time to speak to Linga, and the guards wanted to know what they should do with such requests. I told the guards that no one was to be allowed to see the prisoner. It then occurred to me that this might just give us the opportunity we were looking for. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It did not take a genius to realize that these friends of Linga were not motivated by any kindness of heart, but wanted a share of the loot. There is a Kannada proverb to the effect that the goldsmith became a staunch devotee of the temple on learning that the eyes of the idol were made of precious stones. From all this activity I concluded that Linga’s loot was in safe keeping with some intimate of his, someone whom he particularly trusted. Linga’s devotees also had in all probability come to the same conclusion. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I had announced that the Government would pay a reward of a hundred rupees for any assistance that led to the recovery of the jewels. When we probed further, we were informed that these friends of Linga were Patel Devarsay Gowda’s men who wanted to win this reward by solving the crime. I did not believe it, for there were all sorts of men who seemed to be interested. Some were men known to the Patel, some others goldsmiths, while others – though staying discreetly in the background – were Jain merchants and money lenders. I did not believe that there would be such hectic activity for a mere hundred rupees, especially on the part of the Jain merchants, who often made that kind </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>of money in a single day. My guess was that the goldsmiths were nothing more than middle men for the Jain merchants who were after the whole loot. At the same time, as businessmen with reputations to protect, they wanted to have nothing to do directly with a character like Linga. They just wanted to buy his goods at the lowest possible price and turn a good profit. It was easy money. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It was not a comfortable position for me. The name of Patel Devarsay Gowda kept cropping up in our investigation, making me wonder what game he was up to. As the Patel of Saligrama, he was my subordinate, but as I have previously described, his standing in these parts greatly exceeded his official station. It made me wonder if the Patel himself was after the gold. Up to now, in all of my dealings with him, I had found him upright, honorable and co-operative, but one never knew. There was not a day to lose. Within a short time, no trace of the gold would be left with so many men hot on its trail. Suddenly, I had an idea; could we somehow get one of Linga’s own accomplices to reveal something. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I told the inspector that these people would try to persuade an increasingly anxious Linga to reveal the whereabouts of the stolen goods by promising to get him out of custody. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The inspector agreed it was an excellent idea, but wanted to know how we would go about it. After some discussion, we decided to float a story that Linga would be moved to the Mysore jail. This, we hoped, would intensify the activities of these men, making them anxious to talk to him in the hopes of getting the information out of him. We would then set a trap for one or more of these men by allowing him to see and speak to Linga, with one of our own agents also present. Our agent would then report their scheme to us. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Apart from unforeseen circumstances, this plan would stand or fall on the courage, resourcefulness, and, above all, the integrity of the man selected to act as our agent. If, to this man, money were more important than official recognition, he could be bought off by the promise of bribes. The joke would then be on us. He and the prisoner could make a huge profit by dividing up the loot between them, and also have some </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>fun at our expense. Such a fiasco would soon pass into folklore to be told and retold by generations of thieves. But we could not think of anything better, and decided to go through with my scheme with me personally in charge. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I also believed I had the right man for the job, a powerfully built young, police constable by name Sheikh Mohaddin. He came from a good family that had fallen on lean years. He was new to the police force; so he had not acquired the cynical outlook common among jaded junior policemen. He was ambitious to make a name for himself and gain rapid promotion. Above all, he was utterly loyal to me, regarding me as his father, teacher, and master. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

Our plan was to create the impression that Linga would be moved from the station to the Traveler’s Bungalow, preliminary to his transfer to the Mysore jail. Then I gave him the following detailed instructions. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>“Linga is in police custody in Saligrama. You are to bring him from the station house where he is held, to my charge in the traveler’s Bungalow. It is a distance of little more than a mile. The prisoner is to be securely shackled, and in no circumstances are you to let him out of your sight. The road from the station to the bungalow passes through open country, except by the pond where there is some cover – just some trees and bushes. The two of you are likely to be accosted by some of Linga’s associates who will want to talk to him. At first refuse their request, but give in later – after some pressure from them. Your job is to remember everything they say and report it to me. If they offer you a bribe, pretend you are agreeable. You must convince them that you are interested in joining them for money. There is no need for you to be in the least afraid. I’ll have two armed policemen close by, hiding in the depression less than a hundred yards from the pond.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The Saligrama traveler’s Bungalow is about a mile from the station by a road that climbs the causeway over the Kaveri. Under normal conditions, one can negotiate the distance on foot in about twenty minutes or at most half an hour. If things went according to plan, we expected it would take the two of them about an hour to reach us, with Sheikh Mohaddin escorting a shackled prisoner. But an hour and a half had passed since Sheikh Mohaddin and Linga had left the station house, and still there was no sign of them. We were getting worried, particularly about Sheikh Mohaddin’s safety. In my wild imagination, I even thought he might have been murdered by Linga’s accomplices, with all of them making their escape. I chided myself for entrusting this great responsibility to a mere boy. The inspector was equally concerned. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Reluctantly, I refused him permission. But if it had taken any longer, let alone send the inspector, I would have gone there myself. Then greatly to our relief, a policeman came and reported that Sheikh Mohaddin had just arrived with the prisoner. Linga scowled at us and turned his face away. I told the inspector to take Linga to a room and question him about some new evidence that had turned up. The inspector and two policemen took Linga away. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

Are you afraid I might run away, carrying away this precious hundredweight of irons on me?’ I refused saying that my </SPAN

They felt that the inspector held Linga in custody out of fear that no one would give evidence against him if he were free. So, their idea is have him freed on bail after which the inspector will have nothing on his hands. Their plan is to engage a good lawyer and go all the way to the Sessions Court in Mysore to get Linga free. But all this required money. If only Linga would hand over some of the stolen goods to Lachmey Gowda, he would get a good lawyer, grease any palms that may be necessary, and get Linga free on bail.” </SPAN

Then Linga warned them that the contact had to be Malliah; no one else would do. Just one more person could accompany Malliah. After many promises on both sides, and protestations of loyalty, Lachuma and Pataki left us. To explain our delay, I was advised to say that Linga had to stop to relieve himself, which took quite some time because of the shackles and the complicated way in which the two of us were jointed.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>After I finished briefing the inspector on Sheikh Mohaddin’s story, we both felt elated at the success of my scheme so far. But as Malliah would be going to see Linga’s wife the same night, it left us with several problems to be dealt with immediately. First, we had to arrange a police party to watch the activities at Linga’s house in Tandrey. Also, the leader of the gang, Lachmey Gowda, was Patel Devarsay Gowda’s nephew. This had the potential to complicate things for us. Our course of action was clear. The priest Mallaiah would be at Linga’s house at midnight for the gold. This meant we would have to be there a few hours earlier and keep a watch. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This involved some risks. Four or five of us would have to negotiate the deserted road to Tandrey – a distance of some eight miles in the dead of night. If Patel Deversay Gowda were also involved, we would be quite vulnerable; he might even have some persons in the police force reporting to him for all we knew. If such were the case, we could be quite sure that Devarsay Gowda would take steps to ensure that Mallaiah’s mission to Tandrey would be accomplished, while at the same time foil our efforts to catch them in the act. He might even have a raiding party to greet us at an ambush on the lonely road; or postpone Mallaiah’s visit to a later day. Just about anything was possible. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Then I decided our best course was to send for Devarsay Gowda immediately to have him in my camp. At the very least, this would prevent Lachme Gowda or Pataki from briefing him before we could. We would flatter him by saying that his help was indispensable as he knew the area better than any of us. His presence in our group would at least eliminate the possibility of any of his men trying foul play against us. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I sent word to the Patel to come over to the Traveler’s Bungalow immediately. He showed up within the hour. I briefed him on our plan, without telling him that Lachmey Gowda and Pataki were involved. I asked him to accompany us to Tandrey and requested his help. He was very enthusiastic. I invited him to dine with me. I have to admit that I had never found Devarsay Gowda to be anything but upright and co-operative in all his dealings with me so far. Everything negative I had heard was just hearsay, but I had to be careful. </SPAN

>I next instructed my orderly to bring my horse to Tandrey the following morning. Our party left on foot for Tandrey around eight in the evening, four hours being more than enough time to cover the eight miles from Saligrama to Tandrey. But the going proved harder than we had anticipated. The wind picked up, and a cold rain began to fall. Our party consisted of the inspector and myself, both armed with revolvers, the Patel and two police constables with lathis. With just a hand lantern to show us the way in that pitch dark night, in that rain and wind, we sloshed our way through the mud. It was near eleven o’clock by my watch when we reached Tandrey. Only a few dogs barked when they saw us, but no one came out to investigate. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Tandrey was a small village with just a few houses and farms. Linga’s house was at the far end of the village with no houses beyond it. It was a small house, surrounded by courtyards, with a backyard about fifty feet deep enclosed by a thorny hedge. I posted two sentries, one on either side of the house, so they could notify us should anyone be approaching the house. Patel Devarsay Gowda, the inspector, and I, covered ourselves with blankets, and crouched by the fence on the side where the village main road led to the house. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>As the hour passed, the rain turned into a cold drizzle, which, together with the wind made it extremely uncomfortable. We were soon soaked to the skin and sat shivering in the cold. Still, there was no sign of Mallaiah. I began to wonder if we had been forestalled, with the thieves having made good with the gold hours earlier. “May be Lachuma, Pataki, and the rest are seated before a warm fire, feasting, making fun of us crouching in this wet mud in this dirty backyard,” I thought. Devarsay Gowda was snoring lightly. The inspector, a heavy smoker, was struggling to muffle his coughs in the blanket. I cursed the awful rain, not knowing what a godsend it was to prove. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Soon we heard some dogs barking. One of our sentries crawled towards us and put us on alert whispering that someone was approaching. We squeezed our way through a hole in the hedge fence and pressed ourselves against a wall. We saw a dim light approaching in our direction, and then stop a hundred or so yards from the house. There were three men. Two of them stayed back with the light. One of them approached the house, walking slowly. He all but melted into the darkness until he materialized in front of the door, less than thirty feet from us. We lost him again as he disappeared behind the wall. Just then, we heard a loud scratching sound, as if someone was scratching on the door with a sharp stone or a piece of pottery. Next we heard a muffled female voice, as if she were speaking from behind a closed door. </SPAN

She disappeared in the direction away from the village, leaving us in complete darkness. I now have to wonder how long we might have stayed undiscovered without the howling wind and the rain helping to muffle our noises. The rain continued as a light drizzle. We waited for about half an hour. We then heard some footsteps and saw the woman returning at a run, coming in from a different direction than the one by which she had left. </SPAN

The inspector blew the police whistle, and I fired a couple shots from my revolver to rouse the village. I ordered Linga’s wife to open the door to be searched. There was no reply. We were afraid she might have done herself some harm like hanging herself. I called for some witnesses and forced the door open and entered the house. As I previously said, Linga’s wife – that was who the woman was – was an excellent actress. As soon she saw us, she assumed the attitude of an indignant woman whose virtue was being threatened. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>How to deal with this preposterous suggestion! I told the Gowda to be quiet and made arrangements for two distinguished ladies of the village to be sent in to assist us. They soon arrived. One was the wife of the Patel of Tandrey, and the other a wealthy farmer’s wife. I explained our presence, and requested them to search Linga’s wife – I don’t recall her name, so I’ll call her Nanjamma. The house was quite small, just one room with a living area and kitchen. The inspector and the policemen searched every inch of it and found no trace of gold. The ladies also searched Nanjamma mercilessly and found nothing. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It was now broad daylight. I now had the onerous task of writing a report that our effort had turned up nothing. Before doing it, I thought I should take one more look. The inspector and the Patel of Tandrey accompanied me. I looked around the place. It was an ordinary house, somewhat smaller than the average, but adequate for a childless couple. At first I found nothing suspicious. Then, I inspected the cooking stove and the sink. The sink was clogged up, with standing water and smelly. This struck me as unusual for a house being lived in. More suspiciously, two planks of mango wood had been placed to cover the stagnant water. The planks were perfectly dry, except for a few drops of water splashed on them. This suggested that they had been recently placed. I brought it to the inspector’s attention and asked the Patel to remove them. There was no need to search any further. Gleaming dimly through the brackish water was a yellowish object. It was one of the gold ingots described by Appaji. It weighed about eight tolas. I wrote my report. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>But Linga’s wife was by no means at the end of her wits. She insisted that the whole thing was a plant. She accused that it might be the inspector, or Patel Devarsay Gowda who never liked her husband. Heaven forbid! Why, it might even be the Subedar himself, hoping to be promoted. The village elders and the leaders of her caste tried to reason with her, but she would not budge. The police wanted to take her to the station, and use their usual method, but I would have nothing of it. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Then an idea struck me, something I should have seen long ago. The rain we had suffered through in the night was a slow drizzle. It was enough to soften the soil – enough to catch footprints, but not hard enough to wash them away. So, it should be possible to track down the path taken by Linga’s wife when she went to retrieve the gold. Ordering my companions to wait, I went following the footprints made by Nanjamma on her way out. It soon led to a field grown thick with jowar about waist high, and I lost the trail. I then remembered that on her return, she had come by a different route. So I went back and followed her return trail. This time I had no difficulty. I reached an open spot </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>where the trail ended, and saw also the incoming trail of footprints from out of the jowar growth. The ground showed signs having been freshly dug up; even the implements – a small shovel and a pick – were still lying there. I hailed a farmer working in the adjacent field and gave him instructions to bring the party and Linga’s wife from her house. I also instructed him to make sure that no one stepped on the footprints. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

>The poor woman had tears in her eyes, but this time there was no acting. Then she herself dug the rain-softened earth with the pick and exposed a dirty cloth bundle buried less than a foot underneath. She took the bundle and handed it to me. We saw several pieces of gold jewelry set with diamonds, rubies and other precious stones. She told us that Linga had left them with her for safe-keeping. Believing it to be unsafe to have them in the house, she had buried them in a spot in their farm. I next asked her about Poojari Mallaiah. </SPAN

>I was involved in another major criminal investigation during my term as Amildar of Yedatore. Even before taking charge of Yedatore taluk, I had become familiar with the case – a sensational murder in the taluk involving two brothers. I was fully briefed by Mr. Krishnaji Rao, who handed me charge of the taluk. It was a gruesome affair. The crime had taken place in the village of Abboor on the banks of the Kaveri. The assassins and the victims were cousins living as neighbors in the same village. As often is the case, the whole thing started out as a land dispute. Refusing compromise, the two parties fought it out in the courts to the bitter end. The courts awarded the title to all of the land to one party, depriving the opposing party – two brothers by name Dodda Haida and Putta Swamy, of everything. It was a rout. </SPAN

Its leader was also not exactly reticent about his legal triumph. Like the ill-fated Duryodhana in the ‘Mahabharata’, the winner pompously declared, “I shall not yield even a single needlepoint of land!” The losers had also to contend with the scornful laughter of the village women and barbs from their erstwhile friends: </SPAN

>The wind was favorable to chaffing, and the farmers were taking bundles of harvested grain (with stalks) to their winnowing grounds. One particular evening, Madiah had planned to begin moving the harvested grain – rice paddy – to his house for storage, assisted by his wife, brothers, and a few servants. This gave Dodda Haida his opportunity. He posted his brother Putta Swamy to stand guard with an axe, just a few yards from the door of Madiah’s house. He positioned himself by the door armed with a machete, determined to cut down anyone who came out of the house. The whole thing had been planned in every detail. The victims had no inkling of what was in store for them. </SPAN

He received such a vicious blow across his head that a part of it was completely sliced off. He was struck again as he staggered. He screamed as he fell, and his wife and eight-year-old son ran out of the house. They were both dispatched with a single blow each. While Dodda Haida was thus engaged, Madiah’s brother saw blood flowing in the drainage gutter, and tried to make his escape through the opposite end of the alley. He was chased down the alley by Putta Swamy and cut down. His wife managed to escape by running into a neighbor’s house. No one in the village was willing to go near the assassins, as they stood soaked in blood, with weapons in their hands dripping with blood. Dodda Haida seemed to have gone mad. He kept screaming that he would cut down anyone who came near him. </SPAN

By then it was night, but there was plenty of moonlight. The Patel gave the police party a detailed account of the events. </SPAN

Dodda Haida is threatening to cut down anyone that goes near him. I think he has gone mad. His wife has locked herself in their house and is scared to death of him. He is a huge man— very strong, and doesn’t seem to care if he gets killed. He is sure to murder anyone who goes near him. Our only option is to shoot him dead or least bring him down by wounding him with the rifle.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>But how to shoot him with a rifle with no cartridges? Finally, the young constable Gundappa came up with a bold plan. He sent for some chilli powder from the Patel’s home and mixed it with mud. His plan was to place a policeman’s turban on a lathi or club, slowly bring it into Dodda Haida’s sight from a concealed position near the entrance to the alley where he was standing. The hope was that the murderer would strike it with his weapon, taking it for a policeman in that dim light. This would give enough time for Gundappa to throw mud mixed with chilli powder in the murderer’s eyes and wrestle him down and hold on to him long enough for his companions to rush in and apprehend the murderer. Chilli powder is excruciatingly painful when it gets in the eye and causes temporary blindness. Mixing it with mud would help the powder travel farther through the air when thrown. It was a bold plan, but full of danger. I have already said that Gundappa was a brave lad. He now showed his mettle. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

The young policeman launched himself on the murderer and threw his arms around him. Both men fell to the ground. His companions rushed in and handcuffed Dodda Haida and pinned him down. Putta Swamy, who was hiding in a boat in the bushes by the river, was apprehended the next day. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>As I said, all this had taken place a few months before my taking charge of the taluk. In fact, the case was being heard in court in Mysore when I received orders to assume charge as Amildar of Yedatore taluk. But it was such a sensation, that it was still being talked about when I took charge. I was to have several adventures with these two murders, which I will next relate. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Their guilt was established in the Sessions Court and they were both sentenced to be hanged. They appealed against the judgment, and the two men were kept in the Mysore jail with a final decision still pending in the chief court. There was little chance of the chief court reversing the lower court’s decision; but in the meantime the two men pulled off a daring escape, creating an even greater sensation. In the dead of night, they murdered the jail warden, and made their escape by scaling the prison walls using the dead man’s leg straps (in those days policemen used lengthy leg straps with their boots instead of stockings). Their act was not discovered until the next morning when the warden’s body was found. It was not clear if they had the assistance of any outside accomplices. This happened when I had been Amildar for a few months. </SPAN

Displaying great courage, my deputy commissioner (DC) Sparkes and a few reserve policemen searched through the sugar cane fields surrounding the area, firing their guns several times but accomplishing little more than damaging the standing crops with their boots and bullets. We then received reports that the two escaped convicts had returned to their native village and gone into hiding, assisted by a few of their kinsmen. According to these reports they were spending their daylight hours on some rafts in the river or in the surrounding woods, making their way to </SPAN

>When he received this report, DC Sparkes Sahib came to Abboor to look for the fugitives. I joined him in the search. We rode around carrying our weapons, and though we no doubt presented an impressive sight, our search proved fruitless. I politely pointed out to the DC, that to be caught by such inept exercises, the two men must not only be murderers but idiots as well. I told him that without reliable informers, looking for them in their own home territory was like searching for needles in a haystack. With this in mind I suggested to Sparkes that our strategy should be to recruit some informers, and this would take both time and money. I also pointed out that their accomplices who were carrying food to them had probably armed them as well. It was sheer folly for us to try tracking them in their own territory. It was safer to follow a wounded tiger. </SPAN

The monetary reward didn’t mean a whole lot to me, but as a young sportsman, the challenge of this unique hunt – pitching my brain against theirs – appealed to my imagination. I also thought it would make my name famous in government circles, and more importantly, I would gain public fame. I devoted every spare moment, my energy, and my brains to this manhunt. I had a few hair-raising experiences, and one, just one, touching and even humbling experience. </SPAN

He was a petty trader who did his business selling retail to villagers in santhes (village trading gatherings). His modus operandi was to tour villages and buy grain and produce wholesale from the farmers at low prices, and sell retail at the santhes in various villages. Santhes are held on different days of the week in different </SPAN

This allowed him to turn a decent profit and also brought him into contact with a lot of people from whom he would pick up stray pieces of gossip. He often traded this information for money with the police. He knew both the murderers and several of their kinsfolk. His work also brought him into contact with village officials including the Patel and the Shanbog of Abboor. He agreed to co-operate with the police by gathering any information he could about the fugitives. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

I told him to report to the inspector who would keep me informed. Frankly I was repelled by his personality and mannerisms. He would act a little familiar and look at me as if we shared confidences.

Later they went to Saligrama trying to enlist Patel Devarsay Gowda’s help. The Gowda refused to have anything to do with them, but some of his men advised them to seek Tandrey Linga’s refuge. Linga kept them in hiding, and sent them food for a few days and some old blankets. A few days later, Linga took the two fugitives to a wealthy merchant in Holey Narsipur just across the taluk boundary. At the time of this reporting, the two fugitives are still said to be under his protection.” </SPAN

Some years earlier he had served a two-year sentence for forgery. His friends claimed that he had been the victim of a conspiracy hatched by his enemies. He and Linga, who was also serving a sentence at the time, had become acquainted in prison.

>Situated south of the Kaveri River, much of Hunsoor taluk in those days was jungle. There were not more than half a dozen unhealthy villages within a fifteen-mile radius. Around these villages some patches of forest had been cut down yielding clearings of about fifty acres each. What little farming there was in these clearings was subsistence farming, barely adequate to feed each farmer and his family. These farmers derived some additional income by working for the forest department – maintaining fire-tracks and forest trails by clearing undergrowth and other minor work. The problem was to somehow get these villagers to help us. No member of our party could go to these villagers directly; Dodda Haida would recognize Gundappa, while I as a Mysore Brahmin and the inspector and Sheikh Abdulla as Muslims would be sure to arouse these Lingayat villagers’ suspicions with our unfamiliar Kannada accents.</SPAN

>I then saw a way. These villagers depended on the goodwill of the forest officers for their livelihood. So, it must be possible to get some information out of them by working through some employees of the forest department to whom these villagers would feel obligated. I asked the forest ranger of Periya Patna, about fourteen miles from our camp, to come and see me. When he came, I explained our situation to him and asked for his help.

>I next briefed the forest guard – I don’t remember his name now – and instructed him to visit each village in the vicinity and get whatever information he could about Dodda Haida’s movements. In particular, we were interested in knowing whether he was hiding in the area at all, and if so, who was supplying him with the food, and on whose property he would be spending the nights. The forest guard returned to us a couple of days later and gave us the following information, “On the other side of the river, about five miles from here, is the village of Maleyoor. There seems to be a fugitive, a stranger to these parts, being sheltered by the villagers. He spends the days hiding in the undergrowth in the jungle and sleeps in one of the sentinel huts or a machan. He has the Patel’s own protection. I have an informant in the village who told me, ‘The fugitive sleeps in a different field each night. The Patel himself arranges his schedule. Once the decision is made, the Patel instructs the owner of the place to leave a meal for the man on the night he is scheduled to stay at the place.’ My informant has promised to let me know as soon as he is able to obtain prior information about the place where this man is going to spend the night. We can then lay in wait for him and catch him.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

We left our camp at Frazerpet at about three-thirty in the afternoon and reached the forests near Maleyoor just before dark. Our party consisted of myself, the inspector, constable Gundappa, and the forest guard. Gundappa was indispensable as the only one capable of identifying Dodda Haida.

It was a solitary jowar field surrounded by forest growth, with a few other small fields – barely an acre each – scattered about in the clearings. Jowar stalks stood man-high, offering us sufficient concealment. At one corner of the field stood a machan on stilts about seven or eight feet high, on which was a </SPAN

Shortly, we heard a rustling in the field, indicating that someone or something was on the move. We soon saw a man muffled in a blanket walking stealthily from the direction of the forest, approaching the machan. As he came to the machan we saw indistinctly that he was a large man and carried a gun in his hands. The light was too poor to make out his face. He looked around as if searching for something. He then picked up a small ladder lying on the ground and rested it upright against the machan. Gun in hand, he climbed up to the machan and drew the ladder up with him. </SPAN

I must have caught his attention and alarmed him, for he gave an audible gasp, aimed his gun in my direction and fired. The bullet whizzed by my ear missing me narrowly. It was a rifle! Not knowing if he was carrying a double or a repeater, I ducked, dropping face first into the ground vegetation. </SPAN

>The inspector misread my move. It was purely a defensive maneuver on my part but he thought that I had been hit. He stood up, raised his revolver and emptied its chamber in the man’s direction, each shot followed by an Urdu obscenity. All six bullets missed the platform by several feet and buried themselves in the trees in the background. The revolver is a very difficult weapon to shoot accurately, and it takes a good deal of practice to hit a target even at close range. We were a good thirty yards from the machan so there was little chance of a revolver bullet hitting him except by accident. </SPAN

My inspector Khaja Mohammad Khan who had been so helpful to me in the case of Tandrey Linga and the jewel robbery was also transferred to a different place. This was a serious loss to me.

He had a large family and he needed more money than what the Government gave him to cover his moving expenses. He was used to buying things on credit and owed money in several shops of Yedatore. This had made him borrow a few hundred rupees from a local moneylender to clear his loans.

The new inspector – one Devaraj Urs of Moogur – sent for the washer man to see if there was any possibility of catching Dodda Haida by enlisting the help of his own wife, whose relationship with her husband had gone from bad to worse.

Abboor is at a distance of about six miles from Chunchan Katte. I explained the situation to Rajaji and he was keen to join us.

Soon we saw the silhouette of a man wrapped in a blanket appear in the semi-darkness coming from the direction of the village.

This has given him the money to buy anything he needs. This has made his wife furious. She is no angel of virtue herself. Dodda Haida is said to beat her and has even threatened to kill her.

First, he and Dodda Haida belonged to the same caste, and his fellow caste members would regard him as an outcaste if he betrayed one of his own. In addition – and this it seemed to me was the Patel’s real concern – people wrongly believed that he and Dodda Haida’s wife were having an illicit relationship. His getting rid of Dodda Haida by handing him over to the police would only confirm the rumor. He then went on to suggest that I ask her to see me and then ask her personally for help. I agreed to try. </SPAN

It is not every day that a government official asks to meet a peasant woman. The Patel told me that Dodda Haida’s wife was on her way, and left me alone. A few minutes later I heard the jingle of silver anklets and toe rings worn by women in those days. I soon saw a tall, sturdy, rather good-looking woman of dusky complexion approaching me. I guessed her age to be from twenty-five to thirty. Her forehead was decked with stripes of white ash and a red dot suggesting she was a devout woman. She had obviously taken more care than usual to see me, the king’s official, wearing a newly washed sari and freshly made up. I felt a rush of pity well up within me to see this unfortunate woman taking such special pains to see me when all I was interested in was apprehending her husband. </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The annual revenue collection and settlement of accounts were the two most important functions that the Amildar had to perform. An Amildar’s record for future considerations and promotion depended to a large extent on his performance in revenue matters. The official term for this was jamabandi. The jamabandis were always carried out at two levels. The first, known as dittam jamabandi was an accounting done at the level of each village. This was followed by consolidation of these accounts into a financial statement for the whole taluk. This was called the huzoor jamabandi. This consolidated account had to be approved by the subdivision officer (SDO) in person. Only then was the huzoor jamabandi official. This was the only area where the Amildar was in any way subordinate to the subdivision officer. But even here, the SDO could not afford to be uncooperative. The alternative was for the SDO himself to prepare the accounts – an impossibility. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>People working today can have little idea of the challenges posed by such work in those days, when every minute calculation had to be done by hand, mostly by the Amildar himself. We had to examine the accounts in every village, for every survey number or land record, work out the difference between the current revenue and that of the previous year, and then prepare estimates for the following year. We then had to do a similar calculation for non-farm revenues from such sources as grazing fees, income from the sale of timber from government lands, fines collected for unauthorized water use, penalties for violation of revenue code and other miscellaneous items. In the case of death of landowners the transfer of titles to the heirs was also considered part of jamabandi. The Amildar had to do most of this work himself, assisted by a few clerks. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This village level work was the dittam jamabandi. It was really a year-round affair that fed into the huzoor jamabandi. The huzoor jamabandi was officially complete only when the DC or the SDO signed the records. If a proper job had been done at the dittam level, the huzoor work could be carried out in a couple of days or a week at the most. I cannot recall ever finishing a dittam jamabandi in less than three weeks. Actually it was a year-round chore; only the final consolidation of accounts and the preparation of the financial statements would take three weeks or more. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>From this description it should be clear that the jamabandi took a good deal of an Amildar’s time. But I introduced an innovation. Whenever I visited any village for work connected with the jamabandi, I would review other papers also – often on completely unrelated matters – and put them in order. At every village that I visited, I would summon the local leaders, get to know them, and find the details of how their village worked. I had a completely free hand in all this work, and was allowed to use my own discretion in deciding and handling any situation that arose. This greatly enhanced my popularity with the people. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Essentially, my method involved studying all the problems of the village in question before visiting it, rather than travel from village to village focusing on a particular problem or function. So the focus shifted from the function to the village. My superiors saw and appreciated its merit; it streamlined operations, and it was also popular with the people. It began to be copied in other taluks also, and soon became the standard operating practice throughout the state. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>For my work routine, I would set out for the village in question at seven in the morning, either by foot or on horseback, depending on the distance I had to travel. I would stop by any trouble spots where some issue or the other needed my attention, talk to the farmers, and then head for the place where the village account review would take place. There I would meet the village elders and review the finances and settle the accounts in preparation for the jamabandi. As I mentioned earlier, other matters relating to the village administration would also be brought to my attention and discussed. I would then head back to the camp around noon and rest for a couple of hours. We would return to </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>work about three in the afternoon and go on continuously until about nine, long after nightfall, and return for a late dinner. At the same time, I wouldn’t exactly starve between meals; at every village I visited I would be offered coconut juice, fruits, or milk. I always made it a point never to refuse these offerings, or otherwise the villagers would take offense. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Both jamabandis were momentous affairs in the annual life of a taluk, and invariably took on the aspects of a festival. At each camp, at least a hundred village servants and farmers would gather to meet with the Amildar and discuss their affairs with him. Neighboring villages would also send gifts of rations, milk, butter, vegetables, and fruits for the participants. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>It was the practice in our country those days for anyone visiting a village to be invited to stay for lunch. It was a very old tradition and a point of honor with each village to offer hospitality to visitors, especially government officials. If the visitor’s caste would not allow him to accept the invitation, he would be given the necessary provisions and the use of a kitchen to cook his (or his family’s) meal. It was also a necessity since most villages in those days had no public eating places like restaurants. </SPAN

<P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>At the huzoor jamabandi, the Amildar would rapidly summarise the financial statement of each village for the superior officer – the DC or the SDO – whoever happened to be present. In case of any dispute over a particular account, the Amildar would explain the salient points and the officer in charge would make a ruling. I always did my best to carry out the jamabandi exactly as specified in government procedures, but in one respect I was not successful. This related to determining the official boundary of each property as required by government procedures, a task that I found impossible. When dealing with wet or irrigated land, in which valuable cash crops like rice or sugarcane are grown, it can safely be assumed that the area being cultivated by a farmer belongs to him. Any boundary then becomes quite unnecessary. Besides, any boundary mark is sure to be washed away by the canal water. Even in dry lands, i.e., lands watered by rainfall only, for revenue purposes, there is no harm in assuming that the cultivated part belongs to the farmer who is doing the cultivating. Any other kind of boundary is useless, and it is pointless to put up any boundary stones or other markers. When there is a dispute, a survey team can be called in to determine the boundary from the map. This is eminently practical. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Government rules, however, required the taluk authorities to constantly update the boundaries by replacing all damaged or missing boundary markers called boundary stones. This called for locating the boundary on the official map, then matching the boundary on the ground to the map, and then installing the necessary markers with the help of a team of surveyors. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This is impossible in practice. If a village has five hundred survey numbers in its account, with four boundaries and six stones for each, it means five thousand items per village. Even if ten percent of these should need attention, five hundred have to be repaired at the time of recording the yield. Thus, for a taluk like Yedatore with two hundred villages, a hundred thousand missing items would need to be located and established. There are not enough surveyors in the world perhaps to finish it in the time allotted for the job. This brings me to a rather amusing episode, which took place the first time I was engaged in jamabandi duty when I tried to go exactly by government procedures. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>This was during my first huzoor jamabandi as Amildar. In my first session lasting from seven in the morning till noon, I was able to inspect exactly eight survey numbers. To my horror I found that not one of them had any clearly delineated boundaries or boundary stones (markers). Even the owners couldn’t remember ever having seen any, and often didn’t know where exactly they were supposed to be. I was very discouraged and thought I might have to devote the rest of my life to put things in order for the whole taluk. The officer in charge of the huzoor jamabandi was my senior friend Mr. A.S. Iyer who was in charge of the survey team. He knew the revenue law very well and was reputed to be a man of great probity and dedication. I explained my problem to him. He just gave me a knowing smile and said, “Mr. Rama Rao! It has its own method. I mean, there is only one way it can be done. I got to learn it during survey training.

Yedatore had the reputation of being a troublesome taluk.

>After my first jamabandi, I was camping in Mirley for about a week to settle some accounts that were in arrears. The regular Shanbog had been suspended for some irregularities, and a new clerk by name Nanjappa had been put in charge shortly before my visit. This Nanjappa was a clever fellow but a newcomer. The suspended Shanbog, whose name was Subbiah, if I remember right, was not particularly bright but a local man. The office of the Shanbog was hereditary, and Subbiah’s family had held it for several generations before his removal from office. Such removal from hereditary offices like Patel and Shanbog were done only under exceptional circumstances involving serious irregularity or crime. Understandably, he and the new Shanbog, Nanjappa were sworn enemies. As a result, there were two factions in Mirley. This was the situation when I visited the place. </SPAN

So I sent some taluk office servants to the fields, instructing them to shut off the water supply by closing the sluices. The farmers first tried to browbeat the servants to make them open the sluice gates. When it didn’t work, they tried to bribe them. This was a violation for which I imposed stiff fines on the owners and had warrants served on them. I then made the whole village accountable by ordering that the delinquent owners should be brought before me, failing which the arrears would be collected from the village budget.

I asked the old Shanbog Subbiah, the new Shanbog Nanjappa and other village officials including the Patel to be present at the meeting.

[He was an excellent cook.] I am a man with a large family – with children and grandchildren to educate and daughters to marry off. You should remember me – I need your help now. Please don’t forget that this is my last jamabandi as your Amildar. I retire in a month.

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>“But in filling our own stomachs,” he went on, “we must never do others any harm. That is the essence of justice. Also, if you have accumulated some money by the time you retire, then you can afford to do good things and serve society. You can be generous towards good causes – temples, hospitals, schools – anything you want. Your children, your relatives; why the whole world will respect you. But if you have no money, once you are out of power you may just as well be a dead man, a corpse.” </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>He certainly could not be accused of failing to follow his own precept, in both regards – filling stomachs and accumulating wealth. While it is easy enough to laugh at such banalities, every government official in those days had to resolve a dilemma – where to draw the line? With the kind of personalized rule we embodied as the Maharaja’s direct representatives, presentation of tributes and offerings had a tradition and history going back centuries that could not be overturned overnight. Added to this was the fact that travel conditions were primitive, with hardly any hotels or restaurants, no electricity and no refrigerators for storage. All this made us dependent on the villagers for basic amenities. So, many of these ancient practices like presentation of food and supplies had grown out of practical necessity. To get an idea of what all was involved, consider the following. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Perishable items like milk and butter could not be stored, which meant they had to be acquired fresh in every village where the Amildar’s party camped. It also meant that food had to be cooked each day, for which firewood had to be procured. Whenever I went on a tour of villages, my party usually consisted of about a dozen people including my cook and his assistant. All these men had to be fed. In any village, the number of people to be entertained could easily swell to double the size of my own party, with the Patel, the Shanbog and other village notables often joining us for lunch. I always carried enough provisions for my party and myself, and acquired the rest of the supplies – fresh produce, firewood, and fodder for my horse and the oxen at the village. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>At first, I tried to pay for these – they were quite inexpensive those days. The result was, though the money certainly left my hands, it never seemed to reach the actual suppliers; generally we didn’t even know who the suppliers were. Either the Shekdar or the village Patel’s servants would deliver the supplies to my cook or his assistant. I then stopped paying for them. This was a practice that went back to times immemorial. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>By this I thought I had arrived at a satisfactory compromise – respecting tradition, while at the same time bearing the greater portion of the expenses myself. Nevertheless, my conduct was considered severe for those days. When I was in Mysore for some work, I went to see one of the Councilors who happened to be visiting Mysore at the same time.</SPAN

>absurdity. It is also wrong to assume that you alone are honest and those before you were all dishonest. There are some tributes offered in honor of the office you hold and not to you personally – offerings of fruits, flowers, transportation, and other such things when you are camping – turning these back is just bad manners; also it is something that can reflect poorly on one’s future prospects. Such trivia is not something that can ever rise to the level of honesty or truth. An honest and sensible man will have no difficulty in deciding what is right and what is wrong. But one shouldn’t be laughed at as an oddity, and one shouldn’t compromise the dignity of one’s office by dispensing with customary tributes of respect.” </SPAN

Then one day, I heard a veteran clerk in my office mention a wealthy, highly respected man by name, and remark how this man, though more than ordinarily tightfisted, gave a thousand rupees to the police just to avoid falling under suspicion. I took this to mean that people who find themselves in difficult positions will take the initiative to bribe officials. The moral I drew from this was that such people can be an especially bad influence on young officials who should be on guard. Sometime later this was confirmed for me in a dramatic episode that I will next relate. </SPAN

>In one of these villages there were a dozen or so such estates owned by wealthy Brahmins. These estates were generally too large to be cultivated by the owners themselves. As a result, each owner typically worked only a small part of his land, leasing the rest to tenant farmers who were required to remit to the owners a part of the annual yield and the tax. This was an arrangement that had been in force through several generations of owners and cultivators. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Some recent irrigation works in the area that drew water from the Kaveri river canal had made these lands extremely valuable. In fact, the new irrigation works had more than doubled their value. The owners tried to increase their share of the yield also, but the cultivators refused. The owners then tried evicting the farmers, but the latter contended that the only right the owners had was for a share of the crop and the farmers had a hereditary right to farm the land in perpetuity – something like squatters rights – which they claimed on the basis of history and tradition. This was a nice legal point that could only be decided in the courts. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The owners, however, had strong reasons for not taking their cases to court; they were sure to be lengthy and expensive, and the outcome was by no means certain. Then some astute lawyers came up with a scheme to help the owners evict the cultivators. The scheme was based on the fact that all the records were in the inam-owners’ names; the cultivators had no direct dealings whatsoever with the Government. They simply paid the owners the contracted amounts including their share of the taxes, and the owners paid the taxes to the Government. Thus, the land survey numbers (or land ownership records) and the tax receipts were issued in the owners’ names. The lawyer’s strategy was to keep collecting rent from the tenant farmers, but withhold tax payments to the Government. The Government would then auction off tax delinquent lands. These would then be bought by the owners and their friends by coming up with the high bids. The farmers with their limited cash reserves would be unable to match these wealthy parties. </SPAN

It was put into practice by selecting a few very valuable tracts that had been leased to farmers thought to be leaders of their party and troublemakers. By the time I became Amildar, this game had been going on for several years and the lands were heavily in arrears.

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

My father, his grandfather, and many others before them have worked this land for generations. I have promptly paid taxes to the owners to be remitted to the Government. Here, I have statements showing separate payments – to the owner for his share of the yield, and taxes to be paid to the Government. But the owner has failed to pay the Government.

It was obvious that the farmers were no fools and had the advice of competent lawyers who had seen through the game. On the side of the owners were many wealthy people who had travelled from places like Bangalore, Mysore, and Hasan. On the farmers’ side there were relatives, friends, advisors, and elected representatives from the state assembly.

When this was done, I instructed them to send us two representatives – one from each party. I suggested that these could be elected by the two parties – the owners and the cultivators. They were to represent their cases to the SDO and me. We would hear their arguments and the SDO would rule on them. As emotions were running high, I issued a stiff warning that anyone disturbing the peace would be sent into police custody. This restored order and the two representatives came forward and joined us. We then questioned them closely and examined the records. The whole thing was quite s i m p l e and boiled down to the following facts: </SPAN

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<LI>
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Each owner of record has several survey numbers in his holdings. Some of these are leased to cultivators and the rest are retained for their own cultivation. But here was the sticker that gave away the game: all of the tax delinquencies are on the survey numbers leased to the cultivators – never on their own. </SPAN
></LI>
<LI>
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The farmers had been working the land for several generations and their taxes had always been paid to the owners who submitted them to the Government. They had continued the practice, except that the owners, in the last several years, had withheld all tax payments coming from the cultivators’ share – but not their own holdings. </SPAN

</ol>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>So the whole scheme became easy to unravel. The owners had deliberately withheld taxes on leased lands to force them into auction. When we questioned, they came up with some lame excuses for this strange state of affairs. The owners’ dispute with their tenants was </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>something for the courts to decide. The SDO and I were both furious at their efforts to manipulate the Government into doing their dirty work. We dismissed the two representatives, and after a brief secret conference came up with the following ruling: </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>The lands (survey numbers) on record that owed taxes would be brought up for auction. If the tenant farmer of that survey number could produce records showing that his share of the taxes paid to the owner of record were not in arrears, the auction of that land would be set aside and the next one taken up, and so on. To collect back taxes, the survey numbers held by delinquent owners for their own cultivation would be brought to auction. Our argument was that it was not the land that failed to pay the tax but its owner, even after the cultivator had paid his due share. This meant the owner had not only failed to pay his part, but had actually appropriated amounts which the cultivator had given as his share of the tax. So there was no violation on the cultivator’s part and punishing him would be unfair. If the amount realized after auctioning these lands proved insufficient to erase the arrears, we would then return to the earlier deferred survey numbers and bring them also to the auction block. </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>I took some time to explain our ruling in great detail. When it dawned on the owners that their entire plot had exploded in their faces, they were thunderstruck. One of them, trembling with anger said to me, “You are dead set against the law,” he shouted. “You are overturning everything our previous rulers did for us.” </SPAN

<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Anyway we began the auction by calling a couple of survey numbers. As the cultivators produced the receipts, we deferred their auction and went to the next one. The owners sat in a funk. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>After a short while, I had to leave the assembly to go into the woods not far from the town square to relieve myself. As I came out I saw a man, one of the owners’ party, standing there waiting for me. He bowed to me with folded hands and said, “Brahmin my lord, a fellow Brahmin!” he appealed to me with folded hands. “If the auction goes on like this, we will all be ruined. You must save us – Brahmins like yourself.” </SPAN
></P>
<P style="text-indent:19px; line-height:18px">
<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Then from within the folds of his shawl, he pulled out a stack of bank notes, a large sum in denomination of hundred rupees. He drew some three or four notes from the stack and offered them to me. I drew back in anger. I felt insulted, especially by his appeal to my caste, with its implication that I, a government servant, could be made to place my caste above the king’s law and justice. I have always been somewhat impulsive and quick to anger, and I reacted by giving him a couple of hard slaps, without reflecting that I was striking a much older man. </SPAN

There was a little marginal farming done by a few tenant farmers who paid the Government a nominal fee. It is not clear to me now what plans the Government had for that land. Though not then in use, the location of the land and the composition of the soil indicated that these lands might some day become extremely valuable if some canal irrigation works were to be carried out.

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Hadya is a riverside village, which in those days was a stronghold of the Lingayat community. Some Vokkaliga farmers also used to live there. After all these years I don’t recall the names too well, so I can only outline the incident. There was a dispute over one of the Vokkaliga farmer’s land. He had been married twice. The first wife had a son who had only recently been married to a woman whom I will call Honnamma (not her real name). The farmer died, and within a month of his death, his son – Honnamma’s husband – also died. The girl and her step mother-in-law did not get along too well. So Honnamma, finding little support in Hadya, went back to live with her father in Mysore. In her absence, a prosperous man known as a Gurukar – a minor Lingayat religious figure – managed to gain influence over the older woman and had the two widowed women’s property transferred in his name. Immediately thereafter, he also attempted to take possession of these valuable irrigated lands along with their standing crops. When the news of this reached Mysore, Honnamma’s father consulted a lawyer who advised him to proceed at once to Hadya with his daughter and claim her rights. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Upon reaching Hadya, Honnamma’s father lodged a complaint with the police. He said the property rightfully belonged to his daughter, and the Gurukar had illegally occupied it. He also complained that the crops ready for harvest lawfully belonged to his daughter, but her life might be in danger if she tried harvesting it. The police told him that this was a civil dispute – a matter for the civil courts – that lay outside their jurisdiction. Unwisely, without waiting to obtain a court order, Honnamma and her father attempted to harvest the crop. The Gurukar had them forcibly evicted with the help of hired thugs. Both had been severely beaten and the poor woman had also been humiliated by being stripped of her sari. The two then filed assault charges against the </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"

I also sent the petition for a preliminary police investigation and they brought back a formal charge sheet with a security warrant for the Gurukar, and summons for the witnesses. I then received news that the Gurukar had absconded. I postponed the hearing and announced that one of the offences that he had been charged with was not bailable, and issued a new warrant for the Gurukar to be held without bail. </SPAN

On the strength of this connection, he managed to obtain an interview with my SDO Devaraj Urs, giving him a highly distorted version of the episode. The essence of his complaint was that I, in my youthful arrogance had overstepped my bounds in trying to arrest a man of his status. He also implied that because I was a Brahmin, I bore a natural ill-will towards his Lingayat caste. A vivid description of Honnamma’s beauty was also somehow made part of his complaint.</SPAN

>His wife was a young woman of about twenty. She was a very attractive girl with a fine figure, dark complexion, lovely features – a picture of health and youthful vigor. I could detect no sign of vice or wantonness in her. Her aspect indicated a resigned acceptance of what she had done and indifference to the consequences. I felt sorry for her; she seemed like a gullible sort who had fallen prey to the wiles of an unscrupulous man. It didn’t seem right to me that her life should be ruined for her one rash, misguided, act. It brought to my mind the words of poet Hood, </SPAN

This abominable woman hounded me at every chance, pursuing me at every santhe in the village. I am a respectable family man, but she – a witch – cast a spell over me and had me in her clutches. She kept pestering me, ‘Take me away! I like you very much.’ I tried reasoning with her, ‘Good woman, your life is with your husband. You have to be faithful to him, or perhaps not. If you decide not, where is the need to run away? You’ll break your husband’s heart.' Even after this sound advice she would not leave me well alone. She threatened to commit suicide by jumping into a well or by poisoning herself. Then she said she would turn into a ghost and haunt me in spirit. I thought, ‘O God! What am I getting into?’ I tried avoiding her, but this shameless slut would not let me alone. Am I not made of flesh and blood, sir? After all, when Gods and sages have succumbed to the wiles of women, how about a poor mortal like me? But as I said, I am a completely blameless and honorable man dragged into this by this vile woman.” </SPAN
