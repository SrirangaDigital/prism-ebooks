      <H3>15 CASTE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>The caste system at the turn of the century, as seen from the inside. Ursus and their privileges. A case involving Ursus and Brahmins. The class of professional entertainers. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>The caste system was an inseparable part of life in the Mysore kingdom. It is probably the most discussed aspect of Hindu society, with many scholarly tomes devoted to it in the East and the West. But to one who has seen and experienced it first hand, most academic discussions of the caste system seem dry and lifeless – bereft of any humanity. I will now try to shed some light on how caste operated in the society that I knew intimately; and I will do this not through any theoretical discussions, but by describing episodes and characters drawn from my own experience. </P>
      <P>Everyone probably knows that a Hindu is born into a particular caste. Brahmins are of course said to be the highest caste, but in Mysore society they were neither the wealthiest nor the most privileged. The most privileged were the Ursus (or Arasus) – members of the caste to which the Maharaja himself belonged. Their male names always carried the postfix Urs, like my friend Kantha Raje Urs. The women went by the postfix Devi or Ammanni. The Maharaja’s mother who had ruled as regent during his minority was named Kempa Nanja Ammanni, but known more commonly by her formal title of Vani Vilas. Ursus were not numerous – they numbered about a thousand in a total population of five million in the state. But they were highly visible, concentrated in and around Mysore – the ceremonial capital of the state and the seat of the Maharaja’s court. </P>
      <P>The Ursus claimed to belong to the Kshatriya or the warrior caste, the second highest among Hindus. In fact, the Mysore royal family claimed descent from the prehistoric Yadava clan to which Lord Krishna himself is believed to have belonged – a claim that can only be accepted <SPAN>on faith and incapable of proof.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>They were the privileged class of Mysore. Many of them had inherited lands and other property and were acutely conscious of their aristocratic status. In many ways, they were not unlike the aristocrats of pre-revolutionary France that one reads about. And like those French aristocrats, the Ursus also were imbued with a sense of noblesse oblige towards their friends and followers. They had many fine qualities like loyalty, charity, concern for the welfare of the common people, and generosity in the support of the arts and artists. Since Brahmins and Lingayats were by far the most educated castes in Mysore in those days, it was not uncommon to see wealthy Ursu families patronizing scholars and intellectuals from those two castes. </SPAN></P>
      <P>Not a few of these Ursus (the plural of Ursu) imitated the style and mannerisms of the royal family. While still a boy, I was used to seeing them parading on horseback, accompanied by bodyguards, acting like little Maharajas. Some of them living in villages and not so affluent, were called “poor Ursus”; but even they would regard leadership as their birthright and hold court. It has always been a matter of amazement to me that other communities tolerated such behavior, though there was probably an element of pity, as towards a people who had known better days. Before the British Commission, the ancestors of many of these Ursus had held feudal offices, but were by my time no longer active in running the affairs of the state. </P>
      <P>But surprisingly, the Ursus were not prominent in the Government. Only one of them – Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs – ever rose to be Diwan, and even he was an educated man who had come up through the ranks. A few others from their caste occupied positions in the state militia, but for the most part the Ursus who worked in the Government held subordinate positions. One Ursu gentleman – Devaraj Urs of Moogur – who came from an old and aristocratic family had served under me as police inspector in Yedatore. But no matter what his or her official or financial position, every Ursu was regarded by every other Ursu as a member of the same family and to be treated as such. In this sense the </P>
      <P>In reality, like most dynastic founders, Yadu Raya, the founder of the Mysore kingdom was of humble birth. He was probably of shepherd stock. Some historians claim potter. </P>
      <P>Ursus were decidedly clannish and formed a clique. If any misfortune or dishonor fell on any member of their caste, the whole community shared in it. I can illustrate this from a case that had gained quite a bit of notoriety in my own time. </P>
      <P>The defendant in this case was one such aristocrat – the same Devaraj Urs of Moogur who later served under me as police inspector of Yedatore. Before his transfer to Yedatore, he had been a police inspector in Mysore where he had become embroiled in a case against two Brahmin youths. He had taken them into custody and held them in his police station on some charges that I cannot now recall. It was said that these boys behaved arrogantly, infuriating this aristocratic police officer. Devaraj Urs was alleged to have subjected them to physical abuse. The two boys were found innocent. Following their release, they brought charges of police brutality against Devaraj Urs. </P>
      <P>This was a case fraught with emotion. Devaraj Urs, as I noted earlier, came from an aristocratic family, and the Brahmins were especially enraged that he should physically abuse two of their boys. This they felt was the worst kind of arrogance – the arrogance of a pampered, privileged, class who thought the law did not apply to them. On the other hand, the Ursus and some of their followers felt that the Brahmin youths had been at fault, provoking Devaraj Urs with their own arrogant and un-co-operative attitude towards a man of his distinguished ancestry, treating him like just any petty government official. </P>
      <P>The case caused quite a commotion. A distinguished member the state assembly severely criticized Devaraj Urs’s high-handed conduct and called upon the Government to make an example of him to show that no one was above the law. His case was tried in the Sessions Court where he was found guilty and sentenced. On the day of the sentencing, many of the leading members of the Ursu caste had assembled in the Mysore Palace for some social function; this was just coincidence; it had nothing to do with the case as later alleged by some. Nonetheless, when someone brought word that the case had gone against Devaraj Urs, many of the guests burst into tears and the assembly soon broke up; the whole Ursu community went into a state of mourning. This may sound a little melodramatic, but I know it to be true. It was reported to me by some friends who were actually there. Later, Devaraj Urs himself confirmed the story. </P>
      <P>Devaraj Urs appealed the ruling. It was heard in the chief court where some of the evidence presented in the lower court was found inadmissible. He was acquitted on a technicality, escaping prison by the skin of his teeth. Later, when he was transferred to Yedatore, I asked him about the case. He admitted that he had roughed up the two Brahmin boys, but his supposed brutality had been greatly exaggerated. </P>
      <P>“I am sorry about the whole affair sir,” he told me. “The whole thing got blown out of proportion. People turned it into a caste dispute. It was nothing of the sort. It is not as if I had anything against them as Brahmins. They were just rude and arrogant – addressing me as if I were an illiterate country bumpkin.” </P>
      <P>“What is done is done,” I told him. “But I will not tolerate any of it. I go strictly by the rules. And as long as you are working for me, you better not create any problems.” </P>
      <P>He agreed. He was not an especially diligent or capable officer, but basically a decent man. He was always looking for some excuse to go to Mysore to visit his fellow Ursu friends, leaving his deputy in charge. That suited me also; his deputy was a much more capable officer. I have already related how Devaraj Urs’s botched efforts to capture Dodda Haida resulted in the latter murdering his wife. </P>
      <P>There were times when caste exerted a positive influence on the community, as for instance, during wedding celebrations. Marriages in those days were contracted only between families belonging to the same caste; inter-caste marriages were then virtually unknown. Whenever there happened to be a wedding celebration in a village, the entire community belonging to the bride’s (and the groom’s) caste would pitch in to make everyone look good, regarding it as a caste responsibility. If a particular village happened to be the stronghold of any one caste, a marriage in one of the prominent families could be quite grand affairs, with celebrations going on for a whole week. The Amildar would invariably be an honored guest at these weddings. There would be lavish entertainment programs provided by hired professionals. This brings to my mind another caste – the caste of professional entertainers – quite visible in those days, but one that no longer exists today as a separate caste. </P>
      <P>Classical Indian music and dance – especially of South India – are among the greatest achievements of Indian, or for that matter of any, civilization in world history. This fact is fully recognized today, and the best families encourage their sons and daughters to learn music and dance, and rightly take pride in displaying their children’s talents before the public. But this attitude is of relatively recent origin; in my time, women from good families – many of them highly accomplished artists </P>
      <P>– never appeared before the public. Men often did; in fact, some of the greatest male singers and other musicians were Brahmins, as were nearly all teachers. <SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The women who performed in public formed a caste of their own, and often enjoyed the support of a wealthy patron. That is to say, they were courtesans. Though outstanding as musicians, what really brought them wealth and fame was their skill at classical Indian dance, an ancient art known as Bharata Natyam. Such a woman was generally known by the name Nayaka Sani. Despite being courtesans attached to a particular patron, they were not considered prostitutes, and, depending on their personal qualities, were often highly respected members of the community. Neither should they be confused with the so-called nautch girls of North India that one reads about. <SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Although they did not perform in public, girls from good families learnt music at home; and those from musical families acquired it almost with their mother tongue. The same was true of the professional artistes – the Nayaka Sani. Some of the greatest musicians of my era – Vina Dhanam, Tayi of Coimbatore, Sundari of Travancore, Naga Ratnamma of Bangalore – all immortal figures in our musical pantheon </P>
      <P>– came from this class. </P>
      <P>I knew quite a few of them personally, and in fact, several of them have given performances at my home before my family and friends. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>Vasudevachar says that even boys from good families were discouraged from making music a profession. When he took up music, his elders were displeased and told him: “Get out of it. These performing artists have neither character nor decent reputation. Go find a respectable profession.” </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>It is doubtful if they could be called a caste since they often came from different backgrounds. This kind of liason between a wealthy patron and a performing artist was common in Europe, but the missionaries who were influential in British India denounced these women as peddlers of sin and tried to abolish the practice and even stop performances. </P>
      <P>Over the years I have developed the greatest respect for their dedication to their art, and their noble personal qualities. They were invariably devout, humble, and generous with a strong sense of community, often making lavish endowments to schools, hospitals, and other charities. And yet, for all their modesty, they knew their worth as artists, and were quick to defend their art and their standing as artists. I can recall an amusing incident involving an artist of a later </P>
      <P>era – the great singer Mrs. M.S. Subbu Laxmi – the possessor of the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. <SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Subbu Laxmi – one of the most celebrated musicians of her generation – and her husband, the journalist C. Sadasivam are family friends of ours. After one of her recitals in Bangalore, she was met backstage by a leading politician, who was then a member of the state cabinet in the early 1950s I think. </P>
      <P>“You see Madam Subbu Laxmi,” the great man said, beaming at her, “I have been listening to you sing for over ten years. Now that I appreciate you better – I think your music has improved noticeably.” </P>
      <P>“No, your honor!” she shot back, “it is your knowledge and appreciation of music that must have improved!” </P>
      <P>This story was related to Rajaram, and is not found in the Kannada original. Subbu Laxmi (1916 – 2004) did not intend any sarcasm. Her personality was quite artless and incapable of sarcasm; to her it was a simple statement of fact. </P>

      <H3>16 A CASE OF COMMUNAL DISCORD </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>A marriage procession leads to communal tension. Rama Rao’s handling of the affair. Support of the Muslim leaders. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>From what I have described so far, it is, I hope, apparent that caste was a significant factor in our society. It was something that no one – least of all a government official – could afford to ignore. It was not a matter of personal choice or feelings, but a reality that one had to deal with. One had to be sensitive to the feelings and rules of the various castes that made up our society. It was not always an easy task. </P>
      <P>While caste rules were respected, and the Government made every effort not to offend any sensibilities, the law of the land was the same for all castes. That is to say, caste played no part in the settlement of court cases; under the law, all castes had the same rights. Failure to recognize this basic fact occasionally led to tense situations. I remember one such incident that took place in 1908, which I myself was inadvertently drawn into. </P>
      <P>At that time I was serving as Amildar of T. Narsipur. It involved a caste known as Toreyas, who also called themselves Gangeya Makkalu. They claimed descent from infantry soldiers who had served in the armies of our ancient rulers. In support of this tradition, male members of their community always carried Nayaka as a suffix to their names. Theirs was a society organized along feudal lines. Each Toreya community in every town and village in which they happened to live had its own acknowledged hereditary chief and deputy chief. They were a warrior-like people and also very close knit as a group. </P>
      <P>They typically went into the police force or worked as taluk servants. Some of them occasionally took up domestic service in the households of Vokkaligas who were thought to be a higher caste. A good number of them were fishermen and boatmen who had their dwellings on the banks of rivers. As often the case with such people, they were superb watermen. In my experience, they were proud, loyal, and industrious – a good- looking race of men and women, but a life of poverty and hardship took early toll on their health and looks. Their one fault – or should I say habit – was to spend any spare cash they might have on drink; these children of the river seemed to be afflicted with a thirst that no river could quench. </P>
      <P>The episode I am about to relate grew out of a wedding celebration in the picturesque riverside town of Bannur. About three quarters of the population of Bannur in those was made up Vokkaliga farmers, shepherds, and Toreays. There was also a small Muslim community engaged mainly in trade. The dominant community was the Vokkaligas, consisting for the most part of relatively prosperous landowners, well-versed in the ways of cities like Bangalore and Mysore, and familiar with government procedures and the law courts.; in a word, the Vokkaligas were a sophisticated lot. The Toreyas, though a match for them in numbers, were far behind in wealth, sophistication, and influence. </P>
      <P>The bride was the daughter of Malla Nayaka, the Toreya chief of Malavalli; the groom was the son of Mada Nayaka, his counterpart in Bannur. It was a wedding custom among these people to have a marriage procession taking the groom on horseback to the temple and bring him back together with his friends and family members. Mada Nayaka requested a license to take the bridal procession through the main street of Bannur, and return by a different route. The procession was to start on its way at about eight in the evening and would therefore have little effect on the traffic. This was a routine request, and I forwarded it to the inspector with instructions to take care of the security arrangements. </P>
      <P>The inspector went over and surveyed the procession route, in particular the main street, normally the busiest thoroughfare in any town. The street was a public road with mainly Vokkaliga dwellings interspersed with a few shops and houses owned by Muslims. He reported back to me that he saw no reason why a peaceful procession with minimal effect on the traffic should not be allowed; the Vokkaligas routinely took their parades and processions through this street. But there was no precedent for a Toreyas’ procession. The Muslim residents had no objection to it and the inspector saw no reason why the Vokkaligas should have any. It was after all a public road, and the Toreyas had as much right to it as anybody else. So I gave them the permit. </P>
      <P>We had made our decision going by law and common sense; but we had failed to reckon with prejudice and unreason. A few days after issuing this license, I found two leaders of the Vokkaliga community – Chamey Gowda and Thimmey Gowda – waiting for me in my office. They presented me with a petition signed by a hundred men protesting my decision to grant the permit to the Toreyas. They claimed it went against tradition for Toreyas to take a wedding procession in front of Vokkaliga houses. This, they further claimed, would be seen as a deliberate affront by the entire Vokkaliga community. They also accused the police of favoring the Toreyas over the Vokkaligas, and went so far as to suggest there might be disturbances if nothing were done. The two leaders asked me to revoke the license. </P>
      <P>I refused. </P>
      <P>“There have been many parades and processions involving people from your caste,” I said to them. “And they all use the main street and other public streets in town. Have the Muslims or any other communities ever objected to your processions? Toreyas are no different. As subjects of the Maharaja, they have the same rights as you and me.” </P>
      <P>They stared at me in utter disbelief. </P>
      <P>“But my lord!” exclaimed Thimmey Gowda. “These are Toreyas – the same caste as our servants! They carry our litter. They clean our bathrooms. How can they possibly have the same rights as us? We won’t accept it.” </P>
      <P>I saw no point in continuing my argument with them. Every kind of mulish pig-headedness must give way before caste arrogance. Such minds are not exactly receptive to arguments based on logic and the rights of man. </P>
      <P>“Now, listen to me,” I replied to them, politely but firmly, leaving no doubt in their minds about my resolve. “I have issued this permit exactly like every other permit – based on law and the police report. But you are now raising an extra-legal argument – alleging it goes against tradition and somehow constitutes an insult to your caste. This may be so, but it has no basis in law. I cannot change the order even if I wanted to. At the same time, you are not bound to accept my order. All you have to do is appeal to my superior in the district office and ask him to overrule me.” </P>
      <P>They appealed to the deputy commissioner (DC) Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs who was also the district magistrate. He sent for representatives from both sides to present their arguments. Having heard them, he confirmed my order. He also sent me an order to ensure that the police took all necessary steps. He also assured me of any additional help that might be needed. The inspector was beginning to lose his nerve. </P>
      <P>“Sir, this is turning into a tricky affair,” the inspector came to me and said. “It may even call for police firing – and may lead to rioting. You must oblige me by accompanying me to Bannur on the day of the celebration.” </P>
      <P>I agreed. I decided it was best to take personal charge of the security. The inspector’s name was Chaman Raj Urs. He was said to be descended from the now defunct Anegondi ruling house. He was a fine gentleman but lacked that extra dash – the French call it elan – of really fine police officers like Khaja Mohammad Khan. We went forth and camped in Bannur on the day before the wedding celebration. A delegation of Vokkaliga leaders came to the traveler’s Bungalow where I was staying, asking to see me. </P>
      <P>“How it possible my lord?” one of them appealed to me. “The DC has passed a very unfair order. We cannot accept it. We will take the matter to the Maharaja.” </P>
      <P>A few others said things in the same strain. </P>
      <P>“We are ready to pledge our lives if need be,” said one hothead. “Let some heads roll!” </P>
      <P>I didn’t want to add more fuel to the fire, but I could not keep silent after what this youth said. I patiently explained to them that as Maharaja’s subjects they had to obey the law, and it was my duty to enforce it. </P>
      <P>“It is not proper for me to discuss the district magistrate’s order,” I told them. “I am his subordinate officer. My job is to make sure that his order is enforced. When he passes a law in the area under his jurisdiction, it has the same force as the Maharaja’s own word. As his subjects, we must obey them. If you think his order is unfair, there are lawful ways of having it countermanded. You can appeal it. As long the order stands, anyone who violates it will be treated as a lawbreaker, and dealt with as such. It gives me no pleasure to punish any of you. So, don’t make it necessary. Also don’t throw away the good name of your town.” </P>
      <P>I then thought I must explain to them the principle of the whole thing and how the Government felt about it. </P>
      <P>“Let me tell you this much,” I continued, “We cannot have different laws for different castes. If we did – the result would be anarchy in a jungle. Also, no one in the Government will rule in your favor as long as you claim extra privileges on the basis of your caste at the expense of another caste. You must live and let live.” </P>
      <P>My patience did seem to have some effect. As the crowd left, most members of the group seemed calmer than they were when they came. I then called the inspector to the Traveler’s Bungalow and asked him to brief me about the arrangements. He suggested that we should ask for additional help in the form of armed reserve police from Mysore. I turned his advice down. I did not see any point in taking what was a local situation, and blow it out of proportion. That would be making a tacit acknowledgement of our inability to control the people in a small town. Besides, calling in additional reinforcements would also convey the idea to the people that we were afraid of them, leading to a loss of respect </P>
      <P>The bridge near Bannur on which Rama Rao and Sultan Saheb had their meeting. It has been renovated since they met a century ago. </P>
      <P>and affection in the whole taluk. Also, these Vokkaliga lads were not exactly cowards – hardly the kind to turn tail and run at the sight of armed police. It would only rouse their emotions and make the situation worse. I needed the trust and loyalty of their community more than show of force. I could hardly hope to be an effective ruler with them as adversaries. Finally, could I show my face in public if my actions should lead to a few men getting killed? </P>
      <P>I had reasons for believing that moderation and good sense would prevail. Many in the Vokkaliga community – perhaps a majority – were willing to live and let live. I had friends in the community who came and expressed their support for me, promising to do their best to see that good sense and rule of law would prevail. </P>
      <P>The next morning – on the day of the celebration – I rode on as usual on my daily rounds of the nearby villages. About two miles outside Bannur, I caught sight of Sultan Saheb – a highly respected member of the Muslim community – waiting for me by a small bridge, smoking a cigarette. Upon seeing him, I dismounted and we greeted each other. He told me that the Shanbog of the neighboring village of Turuganur had told him that I would be coming by this route on my way to that village. </P>
      <P>“Sir, why did you wait for me here?” I asked him. “You could have come by and seen me at the Traveler’s Bungalow where I am camping.” </P>
      <P>“No my lord,” he replied, “I didn’t want to be seen visiting you. I wanted to meet with you in secret.” </P>
      <P>We both seated ourselves on the railing of the bridge. </P>
      <P>“Whom have you decided to place in charge of security at the Toreyas’ procession?” Sultan Saheb asked me. </P>
      <P>“Oh! Is that what you wanted to see me about?” I asked, a little surprised. “Why? I’ll be there myself – personally, in charge.” </P>
      <P>“There might be some trouble. I think it would be better if the inspector went instead.” </P>
      <P>“You mean it would matter less if he got hurt?” I asked him. “I’m afraid I don’t quite see it that way.” </P>
      <P>“Would it not have been safer to request additional reserve police from Mysore?” </P>
      <P>“What makes you think I haven’t already done so?” I asked him. “Besides, I don’t share the opinion that everyone in this town is bent on stirring up mischief. There are many honorable, God-fearing, and law-abiding people like you living here. After all – is Bannur nothing but a den of outlaws?” </P>
      <P>“That is precisely my point my lord!” he said with some emotion. “And that is what I want to talk to you about. You have the power to bring in the reserve police or even the state militia into town if you want. But it would give us a bad name. People will say this is a very bad place. There are many good families of our people also who live on that street. We also have a responsibility in this village. Our people love your lordship. Don’t forget us. We are behind you. Call upon us for any help you might need.” </P>
      <P>I was touched by his concern, but masked it with a laugh. </P>
      <P>“Don’t we have enough parties already?” I asked him with a smile. “Toreyas and Vokkaligas? You want to bring in a third party – of Muslims? And you want me – a Brahmin – to lead your people?” </P>
      <P>This made Sultan Saheb laugh. </P>
      <P>“Sir, I don't have your ready wit,” he said. “But I am not a fool either. All I am saying is this: if you come to the procession for supervision, we'll be your bodyguards. We are taking this responsibility upon ourselves. We'll be at your service.” </P>
      <P>I took his hand in mine and said, “Many thanks Saheb! This is true friendship. I can never forget your kindness. But how do you plan to carry out your scheme? I can't have a bodyguard with me. I had planned to take only the inspector with me.” </P>
      <P>“As you wish sir,” he responded. “But about twenty of our people will be there mingling with the crowd. They'll come to your help if you blow your whistle. These are boys from our gym. Ustad Khalif is in charge of the arrangements.” </P>
      <P>I knew this Ustad Khalif as a very fine wrestler. In fact, I had heard that in one bout he had wrestled Subbanna of Gonigar to a draw. I had studied wrestling with Gonigar Subbanna in Mysore and knew him to be an excellent wrestler. He had been recognized by the Maharaja. So Ustad Khalif also must have been a good wrestler in his prime. </P>
      <P>“As you wish,” I replied. “But no one should carry any weapons. Not even a stick or knife.” </P>
      <P>“I give you that promise. Leave the rest to me.” </P>
      <P>He shook me again by the hand and took my leave. </P>
      <P>I returned to the Traveler’s Bungalow that afternoon. Some Vokkaligas came by asking to see me. I sent word that I would not be able to see them. The Toreya chief brought me a formal invitation to the wedding. </P>
      <P>“I shall be there in time for the procession,” I told him. “Don’t start the procession until I get there and personally give the order for it to start. I can’t be there before that.” </P>
      <P>Just before eight that evening, I received word that everything was in readiness. The sky was overcast and there was a fine drizzle. I put on a light overcoat over my regular clothes and left for the Toreya colony. I had with me the inspector and my personal orderly, a young policeman by name Mada. There was no one else. My decision was that there should be no show of force; my presence as the Maharaja’s representative was to impress upon them the importance that the Government attached to the rule of law. </P>
      <P>The Toreyas received us at the entrance to their colony and led us to the groom’s house. His mount – an old stallion – was decorated with flowers, bouquets, and colored brocade cloth. It was an ancient war horse that must have heard the sound of cavalry bugles and trumpets in its youth; even now, its ears would perk up at the sound of kettledrums and other wedding instruments. It would also on occasion neigh and paw the ground with its hooves. There was a marching band; its musicians seemed to have been quite intoxicated. </P>
      <P>Friends and relatives of the groom – all colorfully attired – escorted him to the front veranda of the house. Lamps, torches, and petromax lamps were lit, illuminating the whole area. The bridegroom came and saluted the inspector and me before mounting the horse. We both blessed him and signaled for the procession to start. There were roughly a thousand men and women in all representing both the bride’s and the groom’s side. The men promised by Sultan Saheb must also have been in the crowd; I could not identify any. Everyone was dressed in colorful clothes and looked cheerful. The people seemed filled with pride that their views had prevailed in getting a license for their parade. At the same time, there was no sign of arrogance or any hint that they might be looking for trouble. It was just natural enthusiasm brought forth by the occasion, and special delight that the Subedar himself had come to their assistance, gracing the occasion with his presence. </P>
      <P>The bridegroom was hoisted on to the horse. He was wearing a long velvet coat and a gold braided white silk turban. A glittering red and green silk band was also strapped around his forehead. His head dress was topped by a wreath of flowers. He also had around his neck several colorful flower garlands that almost covered his attire. The sight of this young man in his spectacular attire, mounted on a horse, seemed to give immense pleasure to his relatives with their warrior traditions. There was much cheering as the procession started. </P>
      <P>The inspector and I walked at the head of the procession as though we were leading it. The two of us had been generously garlanded with wreaths of colorful flowers, and must have presented an impressive sight in the flickering light cast by the torches and lamps. But my misgivings increased with every step. As we came out of the Toreya section, I led the procession into the main street with rising apprehension. </P>
      <P>Most of the houses on the main street belonged to Vokkaligas, with a just a few Muslim houses interspersed among them. I am no stranger to danger; I have been in dangerous situations before – following murderers, wounded animals like tigers and leopards, and in foolhardy situations in the water. But never have I known the sense of tension – sense of cold fear – that I felt on this occasion. I had made the decision to take complete charge of the occasion, and I now felt the full weight of responsibility.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>I was not afraid for my own life; that was a small matter. </P>
      <P>To imagine that Rama Rao was still short of thirty when he made this decision! </P>
      <P>My concern was for the safety of a thousand people – men, women and children – who had trusted me by placing their lives in my hands. I had not called in the reserve police as suggested by more experienced people, confident that my presence alone was sufficient to ensure their compliance with the law. It is one thing to be confident in cold blood and quite another to face the moment truth in the harsh light of reality. I was being gnawed by self-doubt. Should there be a riot, I alone would be to blame. </P>
      <P>We soon entered the main street. There was no traffic, but the sidewalks of the street were filled with Vokkaligas. I detected no hint of any anger or belligerence in their faces, but just sullenness. I felt somewhat relieved, for it did not look as though the Vokkaligas would be taking the offensive, though I felt they might retaliate if provoked. As we were moving at a leisurely pace, Sultan Saheb came out of his house and requested us to stop for a moment. He had brought with him a flower garland and a silver platter with some fruits and nuts like almonds and cashews. He garlanded me and handed my orderly Mada the fruits and nuts to be taken to my house for my wife and children. At that time I did not understand his gesture, but he later told me that it was a covert warning to anyone hostile to me that he regarded me as one of his own; anyone raising a hand against me could expect retaliation from his men. Whatever his reasons, the results were unexpectedly beneficial. </P>
      <P>“Oh! It is the Subedar’s wedding procession!” guffawed one of the Vokkaliga lads. “He looks like the bridegroom.” </P>
      <P>With all the flowers and garlands around my neck, I probably did. </P>
      <P>“I don’t see the bride,” said another. “She must be in burqa.” </P>
      <P>Burqa or purdah is the custom of keeping women in seclusion, followed by some Muslims at the time. At this crack the whole assembly burst into laughter, greatly to my relief. I joined in the fun, pretending to enjoy the joke at my expense. He was of course insinuating that Sultan Saheb was greeting me as the bridegroom with the bride in burqa – a joke not in the best of taste perhaps considering I was a happily married man – but it did serve to break the tension. Sultan Saheb joined the procession and walked down with us to the end of the street. A few Vokkaliga men and women also joined in the procession and everything went peacefully. The next day, a few Toreya leaders and I personally thanked the Vokkaliga leaders for helping good sense prevail. </P>
      <P>From then on there were no mishaps and we returned to the starting point. The inspector and I took our leave and returned to the Traveler’s Bungalow. </P>
      <P>“You saved the situation sir,” said the inspector. </P>
      <P>“God is great,” I replied. </P>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind that all the trouble was due to a small minority in the Vokkaliga community, who, after starting the dispute found that events moved out of their control. I was also thankful to the Muslim community for their support and loyalty; it had a stabilizing effect. At the same time, I was not so naive as to flatter myself that they acted purely out of love for me, with no self-interest. As a very small community, they recognized that if the dominant Vokkaliga community were allowed to dictate terms to others, their own rights would not be safe. This is not to deny their regard for me – Sultan Saheb was a personal friend of mine – but only they were no less motivated by self-interest than the rest of us. </P>
      <P>But ultimately, what saved the day was the devotion, respect, and love that people of all classes bore towards our late ruler – Maharaja Krishna Raja. As long as I acted in a manner that reflected my position as the legitimate representative of the Maharaja, no one would raise a hand against me. My conduct throughout had been based on this firm belief and it had proven true. </P>

      <H3>17 DIWAN MADHAVA RAO </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>P.N. Krishna Murthy retires as Diwan and V.P. Madhava Rao takes his place. The new Diwan’s likes and dislikes. Rama Rao and the Diwan’s favorites. A meeting with Madhava Rao. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>With the kind of administration we had in those days, it should surprise no one if politics and favoritism played a part in the selection and appointment of persons to high positions. Some officials went to extreme lengths to cultivate the political goodwill of influential persons and thereby enhance their own positions. Caste and communal considerations often entered into the equation. I can illustrate this by describing the events that led to my own falling out with V.P. Madhava Rao, in many ways the most political of our officials. He became Diwan in 1907 when my senior friend Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy retired. This was a little more than a year after I had assumed charge as Amildar of Yedatore. </P>
      <P>Madhava Rao was not a native of Mysore, but one of the favorites brought in from the Tamil country by his fellow countryman Sir K. Seshadri Iyer, Krishna Murthy’s predecessor as Diwan. Madhava Rao seemed never entirely comfortable with native Mysoreans. For this reason he tended to surround himself with favorites from his own country and caste. Madhava Rao had started his career in Mysore in the state police force, and had risen to be its chief known in those days as Inspector General of Police. For a short period he had served as Diwan of the smaller native state of Travancore. This experience apparently was sufficient for him to be brought back to Mysore as Councilor. At that time, the Maharaja was still a minor and his mother Vani Vilas ruled as regent, with Seshadri Iyer as Diwan. </P>
      <P>The Queen Mother had complete trust in Seshadri Iyer, and he too was loyal to her despite being an outsider. Consequently, Seshadri Iyer had only to recommend his successor and the Queen Mother was sure to appoint him Diwan. Madhava Rao fully understood the situation and tried hard to get Seshadri Iyer to supersede Krishna Murthy with himself. At first Seshadri Iyer seemed agreeable, but soon began to have reservations. The British representative – or the Resident as he was known – was concerned that the minority of the king was being taken advantage of by the immigrant community to monopolize the upper levels of administration at the expense of the natives. By the terms of the Anglo-Mysore treaty, the Resident had no say in the appointment of Diwans, but he provided evidence showing that Madhava Rao had been actively undermining Seshadri Iyer’s own position. This evidence indicated that during Seshadri Iyer’s illness, Madhava Rao, through some of his friends, had been floating suggestions that the Queen Mother should ask him to step down. </P>
      <P>This intelligence, no less than his own conscience, made Seshadri Iyer – a devout and God-fearing man – to change his mind and recommend Krishna Murthy instead. On his deathbed, he apologized to Krishna Murthy for having contemplated injustice and told him, “I do not wish to face my maker with this injustice on my hands. You are worthy to be Diwan. May you serve your king and your country to the best of your ability and achieve fame.” And he gave Krishna Murthy his blessings and the highest recommendation. Krishna Murthy became Diwan and Madhava Rao had to cool his heels for several years.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Diwan Krishna Murthy, a gentle guileless soul, was close to tears when he himself told me of this. Madhava Rao’s feelings at this turn of events can easily be imagined; and the enmity between him and Krishna Murthy dated from that point. To his chagrin, Madhava Rao had to serve as Senior Councilor, subordinate to his hated enemy Krishna Murthy. </P>
      <P>This story appeared for the first time in Rama Rao’s Memoir. It was not known until that time that Seshadri Iyer himself had recommended against Madhava Rao. It rests on the highest authority since Krishna Murthy himself told Rama Rao. The account given here is slightly more detailed than the one given in Kannada, with details provided by Rama Rao to Rajaram. In addition, Rama Rao felt inhibited by the fact that numerous relatives of V.P. Madhava Rao – many of them his own friends – were living at the time this story appeared in 1952. </P>
      <P>Madhava Rao was not a man to forget or forgive an injury – real or imagined. This inability to separate personal feelings from professional judgments was an unfortunate trait in Madhava Rao, and one that often colored his administrative actions. Having known both the Diwans fairly well, I believe Krishna Murthy was the better statesman, with a fuller grasp of policy matters, and a better judge of people. He was also of a more scholarly and intellectual bent than Madhava Rao and not one to let personal feelings affect professional decisions. Madhava Rao was a master at revenue analysis, with an exceptional grasp of detail – not all that important in a Diwan – for the Diwan did not run the civil service; that was the job of the secretaries to the Government and directors of the departments. Later in my career I was to serve in both of those capacities. </P>
      <P>Above all, Madhava Rao excelled at showmanship. He was an extraordinarily impressive figure with an austerely handsome face and a magnificent, imposing, build. In all my life, I don’t think I have ever seen a better-looking man or one of more impressive bearing. To go with this he had a carefully cultivated manner of aloof graciousness and studied dignity, spiced with a caustic wit. “No one can really be as distinguished as Mr. Madhava Rao looks!” once remarked Sir Evan Macanochie, private secretary to the Maharaja. Though there was more than a kernel of truth in that joke, it took quite a while for people to figure it out, and many never did. They were simply bowled over in his presence. At the same time, I don’t wish to leave the impression that Madhava Rao was incompetent. Far from it, only his presence contributed to his rise in position. Even when he was not Diwan he looked how a Diwan ought to.<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The fact that Madhava Rao was an intensely political creature is not in itself surprising, for he was neither the first nor is he likely to be the last man to reach high office through political skills and personal favors. But what was extraordinary about him was the extent to which his personal wish and political favoritism permeated the entire administration during his stewardship as Diwan. As an Amildar, I was a </P>
      <P>It is said of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg that he owed his eminence in the Prussian army largely to his impressive bearing. Madhava Rao’s appearance and bearing played at least a part in his own rise. </P>
      <P>relatively junior official, and yet was not exempt from his attention on several occasions. I will next relate a few of my personal experiences with Madhava Rao. These should give an idea of how what should have been official decisions and actions were often turned into exercises in personal likes and dislikes. My intention in relating these episodes is not to settle any scores but only give a picture of how the Government operated when a high official let his personal feelings interfere in policy matters. </P>
      <P>One of Madhava Rao’s first acts as Diwan was to reopen the competitive examinations for appointments to assistant commissioner posts. This was a deliberate reversal of the earlier policy by which people like me had been brought into the Government with the assurance of rapid promotion. This was not a contract but a statement of intent, which I fully expected the Government to honor. To this change of policy, of reopening competition, Madhava Rao added a new twist. Formerly, those like me who were already in the Government and had multiple university degrees were eligible to take the competitive civil service exams until age thirty. Madhava Rao lowered it to twenty-five. I was then twenty-eight. So his administration had not only gone back on the Government’s word, but had also changed the rules so that I was not even eligible to compete. </P>
      <P>This impacted me personally. To this day I believe the only reason for this policy shift was to open the door for more immigrants from the Diwan’s own country (Madras State, now Tamil Nadu), and at the same time limit opportunities for qualified natives like myself. At my father’s suggestion I had taken the Mysore Civil Service Examination a few years earlier. For reasons I need not go into here, even though I had passed them with flying colors, I did not place high enough to be offered an assistant commissioner’s post. A couple of years later, Diwan Krishna Murthy brought me into the Government, the details of which I have already related. </P>
      <P>But Madhava Rao knew he could not get away with his designs without some sort of a smoke screen. So he proclaimed that he wanted to attract the best possible talent by broadening the eligible talent pool. He further tried to reassure native Mysoreans by announcing that for every two outsiders, seven Mysoreans would be appointed from among those who had done well in previous exams, came from distinguished families, and had also demonstrated competence as Amildars. I felt I qualified on all these counts and decided to apply. In any case it was the only avenue open to me. </P>
      <P>By then Sparkes had retired and Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs was my deputy commissioner (DC). The two of us, of course, knew each other well. He was also fully aware of the circumstances under which I was brought to Mysore. I decided to apply to him for the promotion. I emphasized how this was the only option left to me; had I been allowed to take the exams, I would have done so and not be asking him for support. I felt my qualifications and performance entitled me to be promoted. </P>
      <P>The Sirdar was most gracious. “Of course I’ll recommend you,” he said, “it’ll be an honor. You have everything the Government has asked for and more. Your record speaks for itself. Who is better qualified than you are? I’ll give you my highest recommendation.” </P>
      <P>He then wrote a recommendation letter to the Government praising me in the most flattering terms, enclosing me a copy in confidence. Whenever he had the chance, he spoke very highly of me to all the top officials including the Diwan. </P>
      <P>“The Diwan for some reason seems ill-disposed towards you,” he said to me one day. “I don’t quite understand the reason. I have said all I can at every opportunity I get. I think you should meet with him personally and apply directly to him. After all, you know the Diwan.” </P>
      <P>There could have been several reasons for Diwan Madhava Rao’s displeasure. First there was my close association with his hated enemy Diwan Krishna Murthy. Then there was his annoyance at my joining the Government ignoring his advice to continue with my private law practice. In addition, there were a few encounters – each trivial in itself </P>
      <P>– which he nevertheless deemed sufficient reason for holding me back. </P>
      <P>The first of these took place within a few days after Madhava Rao had taken charge as Diwan. At that time, an all-India exhibition had been planned for Mysore city to which I was deputed on special duty as chief of the section in charge of the livestock show. This was an event that went on for several weeks, with visitors coming from all over India and a few foreign countries. The preparations for the show also went on for weeks during which I had to be in Mysore. Whenever the Diwan happened to be in Mysore, he would pay a personal visit to the site and review the arrangements. On such occasions he would invariably be accompanied by an entourage made up of his favorites and a few officials hoping to gain his favor and attention. Some of them had the habit of showing off their importance to the officials actually in charge of the work; whether they acted in this fashion to attract the Diwan’s attention or simply out of arrogance I am unable to say. But the result was the same. I was drawn into an exchange with one such person during one of the Diwan’s visits. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>One morning, the Diwan’s party arrived at my work area as I was engaged in measuring and marking out stalls in the space allotted to the livestock exhibit. On such occasions he usually would stop for a few minutes, observe the work, and move on. On rare occasions he might make a suggestion or two; most of the time he would simply go on ahead to the next area. On this occasion, as he approached my area, I stood up and greeted him as usual, which he acknowledged with a smile and a nod. After spending a few minutes looking over my arrangements, he went on his way without saying a word. I went back to my work of measuring out stalls with a tape measure. But one of the Diwan’s special favorites took it into his head to make a show of his self-importance at my expense, in an area where he had no business intruding. </P>
      <P>“I say, what it is that you are doing” he asked, bending over the stall where I was working as he addressed me. </P>
      <P>“I am marking out parallel lines,” I replied indifferently, without looking up to face him. He felt insulted. </P>
      <P>“Look here! This is no way of talking to me. Do you at least know what parallel lines are?” </P>
      <P>“My name is Navaratna Rama Rao,” I said with a smile, standing up to face him. “And I can put a few letters after that name. I have also passed the Mysore Civil Service Examination. You may safely come to me if you wish to learn about parallel lines – and I shall be happy to teach you when I have leisure. But as you can see – I am busy now.” </P>
      <P>Everyone present, including the Diwan’s followers, laughed out aloud at this repartee. It was no secret that this man – a courtier and a man of scant education – was in a lucrative position due entirely to Madhava Rao’s favor. He was a portly, somewhat elderly, red-faced man. I thought he might come down with apoplexy as blood rushed to his face. Nothing like that happened; he was a tough old survivor. He left me in a huff and rushed over to join the safety of his group. The Diwan must have heard this exchange. He turned and gave me a cool glance with half-closed eyes. I knew this episode would be filed away in his memory and debited to my account. </P>
      <P>Not long after this episode, I had another negative encounter with the Diwan. But first I need to fill in some background. In Yedatore taluk was an old jagir called Gondana Halli. It had been awarded to a Maratha Brahmin officer for his heroism in the Battle of Mahidpur – a minor engagement in the early eighteenth century. The descendants of the original jagir-holder had come close to losing their estate to creditors due to excessive borrowing and other general mismanagement. As a last resort, the young heir, Krishna Rao by name, appealed to Madhava Rao who was then Senior Councilor, a few years before he was to succeed as Diwan. The young man gave a graphic account of how his heroic family, which had shed its blood for the country, was now in danger of losing its inheritance to some moneylenders. He begged the Councilor to do something to save him from misfortune and disgrace. Madhava Rao was a very generous spirit who would never say ‘no’ to someone who came to him in submission. He was greatly moved by the plight of the young nobleman. He was also an admirer of military families, which he believed provided a moral foundation for society. <SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Madhava Rao then had a detailed audit made of the financial state of the jagir and concluded that with proper management, all outstanding loans could be cleared without much difficulty. On his initiative, the Government assumed all outstanding debt, with the stipulation that the jagir would be administered as government property until all the loans had been paid off. The estate would revert back to the original </P>
      <P>In addition, it was in the Government’s interests to have revenue producing estates efficiently managed. This does not however take anything away from Madhava Rao’s generous spirit. </P>
      <P>holders once it was restored to financial health. He also made arrangements for the family to be paid a pension from out of the jagir revenues during its administration by the Government. </P>
      <P>This arrangement had been in force for a few years when I joined the Government in 1904. When I took charge as Amildar of Yedatore, the administration of Gondana Halli jagir naturally came under my jurisdiction. Technically it was no different from the administration of any other government property, but it brought me into frequent contact with the jagirdar Venkat Rao and his heir Krishna Rao – the young man whose initiative had saved the jagir. The family lived in a small village called Dagganhal, which also belonged to their jagir. My work with the family soon led to a close friendship between our two families. Krishna Rao and I were about the same age and came from the same community, both being Maratha (Deshastha) Brahmins. More importantly, we discovered that our families had connections going back more than a century and had shared experiences. Our blossoming friendship made me ever more energetic in managing their estate to pay off their debts, restore it to the rightful owners, thereby fulfilling the wish behind Madhava Rao’s magnanimous gesture. This made Krishna Rao especially grateful to me, and he soon came to regard me almost like an elder brother. </P>
      <P>In those days, during the ten-day Dussera festival in October, the Government used to host an official luncheon for elected representatives, important citizens, and other invited guests. Any government servants who happened to be in Mysore at the time would also attend. The Diwan was the official host of the event and his staff, drawn from the secretariat, would be in charge of the arrangements. He would spend that afternoon socializing with the guests and in conversation. On one such occasion, I believe it was in October 1906, I happened to be seated quite close to the Diwan, well within his sight. As was the custom in those days, I had removed my coat and turban and left them with the attendant in a room adjoining the banquet hall. When it was time for me to leave, I got up to go and retrieve my coat and turban. When Krishna Rao saw me preparing to leave, he himself went into the room, fetched my coat and turban, and helped me put them on. </P>
      <P>“Why go to all this trouble?” I asked, embarrassed by his attention in such a public place. </P>
      <P>“Service to a senior friend,” he replied smiling. </P>
      <P>The Diwan had been observing the whole thing with mounting displeasure. He later sent word to the young man through his home office clerk C.E. Rama Rao to the effect, “Your conduct is unbecoming of a man of your distinguished lineage. It simply feeds the Amildar’s arrogance.” </P>
      <P>I don’t know if the Diwan really said so. I only know that C.E. Rama Rao mentioned it to my friend. </P>
      <P>Arrogance. This was a charge that was to follow me all through my career and beyond. I heard echoes of this many times one of which particularly comes to mind. This happened a few years later. Madhava Rao had retired and Sir T. Ananda Rao had taken his place as Diwan. I had been promoted and was under consideration to be promoted again for a post in the secretariat in Bangalore. At that time, late in the year 1911, the chief secretary Mr. Chandra Shekar asked me to meet him in Bangalore. By then my work as Amildar of T. Narsipur (1907-1909) and my later work in Shimoga (as SDO) had made me well known in the Government, but the two of us had not met before. During our meeting he was at first somewhat stiff and aloof, but gradually began to mellow. As our meeting, which lasted about an hour was drawing to a close, I began to sense that his feelings towards me had changed to regard and even admiration. He had almost become a fan of mine. </P>
      <P>“Do you know why I sent for you?” he asked me pleasantly, as I was about to take his leave. </P>
      <P>“You have never had the opportunity of observing me,” I replied. “But now that you are going to have me in your office, I suppose you just wanted to know at first hand who this strange creature is.” </P>
      <P>“Yes and no,” he replied smiling, as he shook me by the hand. “For one so young, you have built up quite a reputation.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>I just wanted to see for myself if the reports I have received about your personality are true or not. I have heard that you are exceedingly arrogant, that you believe </P>
      <P>He had indeed. A year later Rama Rao practically created the Department of Sericulture, which led to the growth of silk industry in Mysore. It was the largest private employer in the State. Even today, Karnataka produces in excess of 80 percent of the silk produced in India. </P>
      <P>yourself to be supremely knowledgeable about everything – this is the report I received from a certain person. I felt I had to meet a young man who could generate a report like that at the highest levels. What do you have to say? Is it true?” </P>
      <P>Needless to say that “certain person” was none other than V.P. Madhava Rao. I masked my rising anger with a laugh. </P>
      <P>“I don’t quite understand you,” I replied. “Which of that whole litany of charges do you want me to confirm or deny?” </P>
      <P>“The charge that you have a very good opinion of yourself – is it true?” </P>
      <P>“True sir, very true, indeed!” I replied quite emphatically. “I am not a fool. Nor am I one to grovel before anyone and say ‘I am a total incompetent. Please take pity on me and give me a promotion.’ God has been kind to me. He has blessed me with as much talent as anybody else. I have the confidence that I can discharge any responsibility reasonably well.” </P>
      <P>“Then you are just the man we need,” he said laughing. “Get ready to come here soon.” </P>
      <P>A related incident had taken place a few months before this meeting. Shortly before succeeding Madhava Rao as Diwan, Sir T. Ananda Rao, while still Councilor, visited me a few times when I was Amildar of T. Narsipur. I was then engaged in some difficult work relating to regularizing revenue accounts. Soon after he assumed charge as Diwan, I had received rapid promotions, first as registrar in Bangalore and then as subdivision officer (SDO) in Shimoga. In 1911, Ananda Rao visited me again in Shimoga. </P>
      <P>“I have heard some interesting things about you,” he said to me with a smile. It was a rare occasion when Ananda Rao spoke, and rarer still when he smiled. “No one has ever said that you are lacking in intelligence – or that you are deficient in energy or ability. But a high official has told me that your sense of repartee is not to everyone’s liking.” </P>
      <P>Again, I felt I was hearing the echo of the episode at the banquet. But Ananda Rao did not hold it against me. He promoted me again, leading to my interview with Chandra Shekar that I just described. I was to hear this echo from Diwan Madhava Rao himself when I went to see him about my promotion. As I reported earlier, after Kantha Raje Urs failed to persuade the Diwan to promote me, he advised me to apply to him in person. I took three days’ leave and went to see the Diwan when he was visiting Mysore. </P>
      <P>While in Mysore, the Diwan used to stay at a place known as the Seshadri House. I would go there early in the morning, join the crowd in the visitor’s room, and send in my card requesting an appointment with the Diwan. I have already remarked how Madhava Rao liked to surround himself with favorites chosen more for their personal loyalty and obsequiousness than any special merit. These men would sometimes hold court in the visitors’ room, acting like little Diwans, displaying for all to see their high standing with the great man. A few of these courtiers even tried their tricks on me. I gave them as good as I got. I remember one man in particular approach me, winking at others like him and say to me, “Hello, Navaratna Rao Sahib. You seem like a devotee waiting at the temple door. What are you hoping for?” </P>
      <P>“Sir, I am hoping to receive the same blessings from your deity that you did,” I retorted. </P>
      <P>Another, an older man, who had just been favored with an extension of service asked me, “What is the story, sir? There doesn’t seem to be much to do in your taluk judging by the time you spend here.” </P>
      <P>“In the two days that I have been here,” I told him, “I keep seeing you too all the time. I’m still young sir. I have more time in my store to expend than you do.” </P>
      <P>He went away stroking his dyed moustache. For three days, I tried without success to get an interview with the Diwan. Every morning, exactly at eight, the Diwan would come out dressed in riding clothes and boots wearing an expression of stern dignity. He would then salute the people assembled with folded hands, walk down the steps and mount the horse being held for him by an officer of the cavalry department. Accompanied by his cavalry officer, he would leave at a trot for his morning ride. He would return exactly at ten, hand his horse to the man waiting for him and go into the house. This was a signal to people like me waiting to see him, that he would not be free for the rest of the day. He would be tied up in official work, business meetings, visit to the palace, state dinners and other responsibilities that came with his office. </P>
      <P>This went on for three days, without any appointment. I extended my leave by one more day but decided I must somehow get time alone with the Diwan. I was friendly with Nana Swamy Rao, the Diwan’s personal aide. I cornered him and begged, “You must somehow get me some time alone with the Diwan.” </P>
      <P>“Look, Rama Rao,” he replied, “I will certainly get you a meeting with him, but don’t hold me responsible for the outcome.” </P>
      <P>He obviously knew I was not in the Diwan’s best books. </P>
      <P>“Immediately after lunch,” he continued, “the Diwan spends about half an hour looking at some illustrated magazines. I’ll take you to see him then. You may bravely say whatever wish to say to him.” </P>
      <P>I was amused by his choice of the word “brave.” I suspect that not many of his men were brave in the Diwan’s presence! </P>
      <P>“Am I going to be brave?” I asked. “After all he’s not going to eat me. He’ll just have had his lunch!” </P>
      <P>I must have smiled a little at my own joke. “Yes sir!” he replied, failing to read my joke. “He’ll be in a good mood. You can speak to him freely.” </P>
      <P>I waited following his instructions. At about half past noon, Nana Swamy Rao came out and took me inside the hallway and announced in Marathi, “Navartna Rama Rao aalaa aahe.” (“Navaratna Rama Rao has come here.”) </P>
      <P>(Barre, yevoon de.”) “Good! Show him in,” I heard Madhava Rao say in the same language. </P>
      <P>I went into the room and found the Diwan seated on a sofa with a lot of cushions, with his legs fully stretched out. I saluted him respectfully with folded hands. He returned my salute with a pleasant expression and motioned to me to a chair close by him. </P>
      <P>“What can I do for you?” he asked, addressing me in English. </P>
      <P>“Sir,”I began also in English, “I am Navaratna Rama Rao, Amildar of Yedatore.” </P>
      <P>“I know very well, very well indeed,” he replied speaking to me in Marathi this time. “Navaratna Balakrishna Rao’s son. No need to recount your antecedents and ancestry. Please tell me your business. Are you on extended leave? I seem to be seeing you daily.” </P>
      <P>“I came on three days’ casual leave,” I explained. “I extended it by a day today. I came here entirely to see you.” </P>
      <P>“Why?” asked the Diwan. </P>
      <P>I then gave him substantially the same account that I had earlier given to Kantha Raje Urs. </P>
      <P>“Sir, if the option of competing through the exam were available to me,” I said to him emphasizing my main point, “I would not be here applying to you to be promoted. But now with this new policy, I am left with no option. The Government has also stated its intention to fill some of these positions with people with the right qualifications – education, family reputation, previous civil service record, and demonstrated ability in the Government. I respectfully submit to you that I qualify on all these counts.” </P>
      <P>“Splendid! You certainly know how to blow your own trumpet,” he said reiterating his “arrogance” theme. </P>
      <P>“You may talk to my deputy commissioner concerning my qualifications,” I replied, hiding my annoyance. “I am aware that one normally should not advertise one’s own qualifications, but there are exceptions. It is said that the child that refused to cry starved to death.” </P>
      <P>“Oh! I too have heard that proverb,” he said. “Are there any openings at the assistant commissioner level?” </P>
      <P>“The Government should be in a better position than I to know that.” I replied, somewhat taken aback by his question. “The last announcement I saw said there were seven.” </P>
      <P>“There were. There aren’t any now. What else can I do for you?” </P>
      <P>“What more can I say? When you have said there are no openings, to persist with my appeal would not only be illogical but impertinent,” I continued. “All I ask is that I be given a fair opportunity – one which my qualifications merit. I don’t know if I am guilty of some offence. If I am, I request your continuing good graces and pardon.” </P>
      <P> “You can be assured of that.”</P>
      <P> “Good bye!” I said taking his leave.</P>
      <P> “Good bye and good luck!” he responded, as he stood up to see me off. I left his room and went back to the place where his aide was waiting for me. I was left confused by the combination of unfailing courtesy and his unbending inflexibility towards my request.</P>
      <P> “That must have been quite a meeting!” exclaimed Nana Swamy Rao as I came out. “You must have had a wide ranging discussion. What happened? Did it go well?”</P>
      <P> “Well! The soap was full of fragrance,” I replied, “but all I got was a clean shave.”</P>
      <P> I concluded that there was no possibility of promotion as long as Madhava Rao was Diwan. My wait didn’t last very long.</P>
      <P>
        <strong> Note Added After the Translation: </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Madhava Rao’s own exit was unceremonious. On a trivial pretext – for tearing down a wall near the Bangalore Fort – he was made to submit his resignation, which the Maharaja accepted without hesitation. This is still the reason given for his resignation found in books like D.V. Gundappa’s ‘Mysorina Diwanaru’. This is not believable. There were more weighty reasons, like his favoritism and mistreatment of native officers (like Rama Rao) that had given the administration a bad name. In 1909, when Madhava Rao was particularly vindictive towards Rama Rao, Kantha Raje Urs brought it to the attention of his sister (Queen Mother Vani Vilas) and the Maharaja. Within a few months, Rama Rao was promoted and Madhava Rao practically forced to resign. (Rama Rao never mentioned it in public probably out of modesty and courtesy towards Madhava Rao’s relatives several of whom were close to Rama Rao.) </P>
      <P>After Madhava Rao’s retirement, there appears to have been a reconciliation of sorts between the two men. Some years later, Rama Rao visited Madhava Rao in Tanjore. Madhava Rao also visited Rama Rao several times, including for dinner, when they were both living in Bangalore. By the time he wrote his memoir, Rama Rao’s reputation had eclipsed Madhava Rao’s, who by then had faded into obscurity. Apart from his literary achievements, as an administrator also, Rama Rao left his former superior far behind. He created the silk industry in Mysore, making Mysore silk world famous. Madhava Rao has nothing comparable to show. His name survives today largely because Rama Rao’s pen brought him back to life. Madhava Rao’s one lasting contribution was restoring Sri Shankaracharya’s birthplace Kaladi when he was Diwan of Travancore. </P>
      <P>Interestingly, Madhava Rao’s great-grandson married one of Rama Rao’s granddaughters. </P>

      <H3>18 THE FALL OF DEVARSAY GOWDA </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>A murder and riot case in a neighboring taluk. Bureaucratic turf battles. The misfortunes of Patel Devarsay Gowda. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>As my term as Yedatore Amildar was coming to a close, I was drawn into the investigation of a riot and murder case at a place called Bidirakka, situated just outside my taluk boundary. Bidirakka was in the neighboring Holey Narsipur taluk in the adjoining Hassan district; Yedatore was in Mysore district. Thus, the scene of the crime was outside the charge of my taluk as well as my district, though it was only about eight miles from Saligrama. In a tragedy of epic proportions, it brought about the downfall of its great Patel Devarsay Gowda. Here is how it came about. </P>
      <P>One day, late in 1907, I was camping in Saligrama when my orderly Sheikh Mohaddin came running to me and said, “My lord, Shamba the Vagabond has received several tulwar wounds. He is in lying in very serious condition in the town gymnasium. He may be close to death.” </P>
      <P>Tulwar is a heavy curved sword or scimitar, a weapon of war in days gone by, but now they are little more than museum pieces and collector’s items. So receiving a tulwar wound is no ordinary feat; one must have done something out of the ordinary to merit it. For me though, it meant a major new case, especially if the victim were to die of his wounds. Little did I know how much more serious the case would prove to be. </P>
      <P><SPAN>As soon as I got the report, I took the doctor from the local fund dispensary and went to the gym. Gyms those days were quite primitive; equipped with weights, clubs, and other simple implements. Their main function was to serve as a place to train wrestlers. The town gym was on the same street as Patel Devarsay Gowda’s house. We tried to be as inconspicuous as possible, but by the time we reached the gym a good</SPAN>sized crowd had already collected. In those days it was virtually impossible to keep the Amildar’s movements secret. On this occasion, in particular, persons connected with the crime must have been watching my every move. </P>
      <P>Upon reaching the gym, we found the place locked. Not one of its instructors or students was anywhere to be seen. I sent for the chief instructor who also ran the gym, but he had made himself scarce. I sent for the Patel, but he too was evasive, sending back word that he was not home. Some discreet inquiries yielded the information that the place had been open just fifteen minutes prior to our arrival. I then collected a group of town elders as witnesses, got a warrant prepared, and made preparations to break the lock and force our entry. As we were about to break the lock, one of the junior instructors came running and let us in with the key. He told me that his chief had gone to work on his farm, placing him in charge. </P>
      <P>To anyone who has seen a turn of the century Indian gym, my description is bound to sound bland. The interior was dark, the air dank with the combined odor of sweat and oil, a sense heightened by the absence of windows. The whole place was approximately fifteen-feet wide and thirty-five feet long, with nearly a third of it taken up by the akhada – nothing but a pit filled with soft red mud. The remainder of the place was filled with heavy clubs, stone weights, chains, and other implements used for exercises in those days. In one corner of the gym was a smooth granite pillar about eight inches in diameter and seven feet tall. This is a particularly challenging exercise – to climb this pole, dragging oneself up with just the arm muscles. </P>
      <P>The gym had no lights. I had a police lantern brought in and looked around for any signs of the victim. The dim light thrown by the lantern revealed the outline of what seemed like a bundle of clothes lying on the ground, in the same corner as the granite pillar. On approaching it, we found it to be the body of an inert man. I had two more lanterns brought in and asked the doctor to examine it. Covered with blood-soaked sheets was the still breathing body of a large-sized, heavily-built man, known locally as Shamba the Vagabond. His shirt, drenched in blood, had caked and stuck to the wounds. He had also received a blow to the head, which had been dressed with powdered charcoal or some such country preparation. He was lying unconscious with eyes half closed. </P>
      <P>The doctor removed the head bandage, washed the wound, and exposed a cut about two inches long. Having cleaned it thoroughly, he examined the full extent of the injury by pressing the victim’s skull around the wound. He turned to me and said in English, “The wound is superficial. The skull doesn’t seem to be cracked. The victim has lost a good deal of blood, but he is a strong young man in excellent condition. Unless there is some complication from tetanus or infection – due more to their quack treatment than the wounds themselves – his life is in no danger. He should recover.” </P>
      <P>I had Shamba transferred to the hospital on a stretcher and left strict orders that no one other than the doctor and his staff were to be allowed to see him. I left enough policemen in charge to ensure that my orders would be strictly carried out. I also left instructions that I was to be informed as soon as the patient had regained consciousness and was strong enough to speak. </P>
      <P>The same evening, a messenger came to me and reported that Shamba had regained consciousness and was anxious to speak to me. I went to the hospital and saw the doctor first. He informed me that though his life was in no danger, Shamba himself was in deadly fear of his own impending death. </P>
      <P>“It’s alright,” I said. “Then, may be he’ll tell us the whole truth.” </P>
      <P>I went into Shamba’s ward and obtained a complete account. I will relate in my own words. </P>
      <P>In the village of Bidirakka in the adjacent Holey Narsipur taluk lived a farmer, Boray Gowda by name. He was a relative of Devarsay Gowda – his brother-in-law or some other relation – I don’t now exactly recall. Anyway, this Boray Gowda had borrowed large sums of money from a Muslim leather merchant known as the Labbey Saheb, pledging his land as security. As Boray Gowda’s payments fell into arrears, his creditor – the Labbey Saheb – obtained a court order to have the land auctioned and gained title to it by coming up with the highest bid. For a member of the Vokkaliga caste like Boray Gowda, land ownership was not just his means of livelihood, but a matter of honor and even a reflection on his manhood. Loss of land meant loss of his identity as ‘mannina maga’ – or son of the soil. With the help of some friends and fellow caste members, Boray Gowda tried desperately to prevent losing his land by coming up with the necessary money; but it was too late. He then swore that he would never let the Labbey Saheb or any of his men enter the lands he had just forfeited. </P>
      <P>“If you can stop me, you’re a man indeed,” said the Labbey Saheb stroking his flowing beard, adding insult to injury, “true son of a Gowda.” </P>
      <P>After this humiliation, Boray Gowda went to his kinsman Devarsay Gowda and begged him to save his land and his honor. As we have seen before Devarsay Gowda was a nobleman by temperament who could never turn down an appeal. He sent ten or twelve of his men – servants and followers from Saligrama to Bidirakka to join Boray Gowda and his party. Although the episode had started out as a land dispute, it had taken on a communal tinge – Boray Gowda being a Hindu, while the Labbey Saheb was a Muslim – though majority of his party was probably Hindu. This was a potentially volatile mix, for the Maharaja and his Government set great store by communal harmony among the subjects. </P>
      <P>Accompanied by a gang armed with clubs, swords, guns, and other weapons, the Labbey Saheb attempted to take possession of the land and plough the field. But Boray Gowda and his men, reinforced by the contingent from Saligrama, took possession of the property, and tried to physically prevent the Labbey’s party from entering it. Soon Boray Gowda’s party gained the upper hand, and the Labbey’s men found themselves unable to hold their positions. In desperation, someone in the Labbey’s party shot and killed one of Boray Gowda’s men. This let loose all restraint and broke into a riot in which a few men were killed and several suffered serious injuries. Shamba received a blow to the head with a club early in the melee, and before he could recover, he received several slashes from a sword or some other sharp instrument. His companions wrapped him in a blanket, treated him as best as they could and brought him back to Saligrama. This had taken place three or four days before we found him unconscious in the town gym. </P>
      <P>I was dumbfounded. How could there be such anarchy, this day and age, when Krishna Raja IV ruled our land? Although Bidirakka, where the crime had taken place, lay outside my taluk and district jurisdiction, several of the participants were from Saligrama which came under my jurisdiction. Worst of all, why hadn’t anyone done anything? There wasn’t even a report let alone charges until my orderly brought it to my notice. </P>
      <P>I was particularly upset that the authorities in the neighboring Holey Narsipur taluk and Hassan district seemed to have done nothing in the days after the crime. Where were the police and the Amildar? (Had they done something, I would surely have known about it by now.) I decided that as a magistrate sworn to uphold the law, and, more importantly, as a servant of the Maharaja, I could not let things slide when a crime of this magnitude had been committed in any part of the country subject to his rule. </P>
      <P>Much valuable time had already been lost, with it possibly crucial evidence. So I decided to take the matter into my own hands and act at once. From Shamba the Vagabond, I obtained a list of names of some seven or eight men of the Saligrama contingent and had them arrested and placed in custody. I was unable to catch up with two or three other men, especially Devarsay Gowda’s son Kaley Gowda who was said to have been their ring leader. Kaley Gowda later claimed that he had been away for several weeks in Mandya or some other place, and was therefore nowhere in the vicinity of the crime. I did not arrest Devarsay Gowda, but kept his house under close watch. </P>
      <P>Soon after the arrests, I sent a detailed report of my findings to the Amildar of Holey Narsipur taluk and also to the deputy commissioner (DC) of Hassan district, making sure they were hand delivered by my messengers. I also sent a confidential report to my DC Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs (Sparkes had retired and Kantha Raje Urs had taken his place). </P>
      <P>“The authority of the Government will be seriously undermined,” I wrote in my report to the Sirdar, “if we fail to act vigorously and in a timely fashion in the face of such a serious crime. Hasan district authorities had done nothing in the three or four days following the riot, until it came to my notice as it did purely by accident. I have taken whatever steps I feel are necessary at this time. Although the riot itself took place in a district not under our jurisdiction, many of the participants are domiciled in my taluk. Also, many related activities – such as the conspiracy, planning, and others – took place in towns under my charge. For these reasons, while I am of the opinion that I have full authority to try this case, a good part of the investigation must go on in Holey Narsipur taluk in Hassan district. I am prepared fully to co-operate with the Hassan authorities; if not, I am also ready to press forward with the investigation on my own. It is important that the rule of law be made to prevail.” </P>
      <P>Kantha Raje Urs wholeheartedly agreed with me. After studying my report, he wrote back, “To the extent possible, press on with the investigation in your taluk. If officials from the other district come forward asking for your help, hand over the case to them with all your records. But it is important that the investigation be pursued vigorously and without any more delay. I have written also to the Hassan DC along the same lines.” </P>
      <P>The following day Kantha Raje Urs came to see me and commended me on my actions personally. He was uncharacteristically upset. </P>
      <P>“You’re absolutely right in what you did, Mr. Rama Rao,” he said to me. “What if the crime took place in a different district? Who cares about these niceties when a crime of this magnitude has been committed? Are those people not subject to the Maharaja’s rule and the same laws? Do these people think it is some sort of a game they are playing? We can’t have anarchy. The rule of law must prevail, come what may.” </P>
      <P>Messages must have been flying back and forth between the two districts – by mail, by telegram, by private couriers, and everything else. A few days later, while camping in Saligrama, Krishna Iyer, the Amildar of Holey Narsipur and the Hassan district superintendent of police (DSP), Narayan Rao of Saligrama, came to see me. By a coincidence, DSP Narayan Rao too was a native of Saligrama. This was soon to lead to some difficulties in the case. They were annoyed with me for acting in a manner that showed them in poor light. The DSP was an old friend and a well-wisher who had known me from childhood. And yet, he felt upstaged by my vigorous pursuit of a case technically in his charge. I showed the visitors all the records I had put together since the discovery of the crime. </P>
      <P>“The conspiracy and the preparations that took place in Saligrama,” I pointed out to them, “and the riot in Bidirakka, are two parts of a single crime. I believe I have full authority to try this case. At the same time, the site of the crime, many of the witnesses, a majority of the perpetrators, and other related parties are in your district. I have no objection to your investigating the whole case. I’ll hand over all my records and will co-operate with you in every way. At the same time, I do expect to be fully involved in the process. I should be consulted on all matters, and, in the event of any differences of opinion, there must be room for resolving them through discussion. The important thing is that the investigation must go on with full vigor.” </P>
      <P>They agreed to my conditions with some reluctance. </P>
      <P>“What are we to do next?” The Amildar asked making no effort to hide his unhappiness. “We’ve arrested everyone concerned in Bidirakka </P>
      <P>– except those who had already escaped. Autopsy reports, medical certificates, and all other records – we have them. What is there to be done in Saligrama? What kind of co-operation do we need from you?” </P>
      <P>“You should be in a better position than I to decide what you may need from me,” I replied, trying not to exacerbate an already tense situation. “But let me make just one suggestion. We must be evenhanded and arrest each of the leaders – the leaders of the two rival factions, that is. I don’t know who exactly the ring leader of the Labbey’s party was – it was probably the Labbey Saheb himself – but you must know that by now. He must be arrested immediately.” </P>
      <P>The visitors nodded their heads indicating that he had already been arrested. </P>
      <P>“On the other side,” I continued, “It is beginning to look like Patel Devarsay Gowda had at least a hand. I see the imprint of his handiwork at every stage of my investigation so far. Witnesses hesitate to come forward, and even when they do, they don’t speak freely as if in fear of him. If he and the Labbey Saheb decide to come to some sort of an agreement and settle the dispute between them, all evidence will dry up. That is sure to make us a laughing stock. And having already arrested the Labbey Saheb, if you now fail to arrest the Gowda, you’ll leave yourself open to the charge of favoritism.” </P>
      <P>I tried hard to be as detached as possible, but my last comment infuriated the Hassan DSP Narayan Rao. </P>
      <P>“What favoritism are you talking about Rama Rao?” Narayan Rao asked me heatedly. “Just because I am from Saligrama and my brother happens to a leading figure in that town – can you charge me with bias? Of course our two families – Devarsay Gowda’s and mine have known each other for years. But just for that – how can you say I would show him any special favor? At the same time, we can’t just go and arrest him. We have no evidence against the man. What are we going to charge him with?” </P>
      <P>“Look,” I said, trying to calm him, “when I said ‘you,’ I didn’t mean ‘you’ as Narayan Rao, a fellow native of Saligrama and the Patel’s friend. I include myself in that group. Devarsay Gowda is close to me also. We have been through a good deal together over the past two years. But what we have on our hands is a very serious situation. As Amildar of Yedatore it’ll leave me open to the charge that I protected the Patel and his men. He must be arrested. Let the magistrate release him on bail.” </P>
      <P>Narayan Rao looked miserable. However much he may deny it, it was clear he hated the prospect of arresting Devarsay Gowda, the leading figure of his hometown. I could see his position. The Gowda was not just the town leader; he was an elder, about the same age as my father. He must have been like a father figure to Narayan Rao. </P>
      <P>“What if I don’t agree to arrest him?” he asked. </P>
      <P>“Then I’ll arrest him myself and hand him over to you together with all other suspects I have arrested. I’ll also hand over to you all my records in the case. You’re free to do whatever you want. I’ll then send a report to my DC and wash my hands off the whole case. This affair is no more pleasant to me than it is to you.” </P>
      <P>After this, Narayan Rao, his police inspector, and the Amildar of Holey Narsipur went into a private conference lasting about ten or fifteen minutes. </P>
      <P>“We are prepared to arrest the Gowda,” said the Amildar upon their return from the meeting, “but we cannot do it without your help. I hear he is a very powerful local leader. We don’t have the manpower to arrest him by ourselves. We don’t know how exactly we should go about it. You should come with us so we don’t have a riot on our hands.” </P>
      <P>“Certainly!” I replied with a laugh. “If you so wish, I’ll bell the cat for you. Let’s go.” </P>
      <P>All this discussion had been taking place inside the Saligrama police station. The visit of two Amildars and a high district police official is not exactly an everyday occurrence in the life of a town like Saligrama. The word of it had gotten around, and scenting something unusual was afoot, a large crowd had begun to collect around the police station. Events of the past several days had already made the town people restive. Filled with misgivings and good deal of distaste, I made my way to the Patel’s house, followed by the Hassan authorities. The crowd, which by then had swelled to more than a hundred, tailed us along. We had no way of dispersing them even if we wanted to. </P>
      <P>The Patel lived in a large house on the main street. I had visited him a few times and knew the place well. As I went up the stairs leading to the verandah, I was received by a young woman – a daughter-in-law of his I believe she was. When I asked to see Patel Devarsay Gowda, she started to mumble that he was not home. But before she could finish speaking, the commanding figure of the Gowda swept in between us, bareheaded, with a large dark shawl draped over his shoulders. The crowd was visibly excited and gave a muffled gasp. The Hassan authorities seemed overwhelmed by the situation, probably even a little scared. I also felt uneasy, but knowing the Gowda’s sense of honor, I felt it best to trust him and deal with him in good faith. </P>
      <P>“Do we consort with donkeys that I must play false before God? Away young lady,” said the Patel, waving the young woman aside. “My lord,” he said bowing to me. “Here I am – your servant.” </P>
      <P>It was a poignant moment. I had heard that the Gowda had not been in good health; he seemed to have lost a good deal of weight. I felt a rush of pity upon seeing this aged head of a large family, and the proud chief of his ancient clan brought to his present state. </P>
      <P>“Mr. Gowda, please sit down, sir,” I said, taking him by the hand. “I need to speak with you.” </P>
      <P>The Hassan authorities, who until then had stayed in the background, walked up the steps and joined us in the verandah. </P>
      <P>“These, sir, are fateful times for you,” I continued speaking to the Gowda. “But if you are not guilty, you have nothing to fear. You know very well I bear you no ill will. But unhappily – I am the bearer of some bad news for you. But you can trust me. I’ll assure you that justice will be done. We do have a very serious matter on our hands – a riot and murder case – in which you have been implicated. We are both servants of the king, and the law of the land must take its course. Who are we to defy destiny?” </P>
      <P>All this was philosophy. Then I finally came to the point of our visit. </P>
      <P>“You stand accused of conspiracy with Kaley Gowda and Boray Gowda in the riot and murder case in Bidirakka. The police superintendent of Hassan and the Amildar of Holey Narsipur are here to arrest you.” </P>
      <P>He blanched. His gleaming dark face acquired an ashen pallor that ill became him. He was speechless for a while, as beads of perspiration broke out on his face. </P>
      <P>“What I am to do my lord?” he sighed resignedly, after he had recovered from the shock. “These hotheads – they think they know everything. Without asking me, they have gone and done this dreadful deed; these spoilt, arrogant, indulgent, bastards!” </P>
      <P>He shook his head and buried his face in his blanket. </P>
      <P>“If this was done without your knowledge,” I replied, “then sir, you have reached the age – an age too great for you to rule your people. So what? All of us will reach old age, should God grant us. But if the acts took place without your knowledge, you have nothing to fear. But that needs to be established in court. Once charged, the courts must rule.” </P>
      <P>I then came to the matter at hand. </P>
      <P>“We have a more immediate concern here,” I continued. “If you should act in haste – why would you act in haste? I mean, should any of your men try anything foolish, should they try to obstruct our investigation or court proceedings it’ll make an already bad situation greatly worse. These men, they have to arrest you – not out of any personal animosity or malice you understand. It’s their duty. I’ll take personal responsibility to see you’re treated fairly. You have my word.” </P>
      <P>As this was going on, the front yard of the house was getting filled with people. A policeman came to me and whispered that the street was also full of people, and that they were becoming increasingly restive. This heightened my concern. </P>
      <P>“Mr. Gowda,” I said turning to the Patel, “I am telling you for your own good, really. Please calm your people. Come with us as if of your own free will. If your people do anything foolish, it will do them no good, and it’ll also seriously hurt your defense in the courts. Just ask them to stay calm – not to get rough. Tell them to have no fear – that you’re going with us to report to the police what you already know – of your own free will. If there is any mischief, it will mean first your honor and then your life will be in danger. If you’ll come with us like a reasonable man, no one will touch you. Otherwise, the police will have to handcuff you.” </P>
      <P>“How can you promise him that I say?” asked the Holey Narsipur Amildar in English. “I think we must handcuff him.” </P>
      <P>It made me furious. This man, who had done nothing for four days following the crime, who didn’t have the courage even to approach Devarsay Gowda without me, had suddenly turned brave mistaking the nobleman’s aristocratic gentleness for weakness. He failed to see the grave danger of his followers turning their wrath against us. One misstep was enough to rouse them. </P>
      <P>“For God’s sake, don’t do anything foolish,” I shot back in English, “It’s hard enough as it is. He is a sort of uncrowned king here – don’t you see? And if once some roughness starts, where are we? And after all, he is an old man and a sick man at that. Are you afraid he will run or fight if not cuffed or chained?” </P>
      <P>The police superintendent supported me. As a fellow native of Saligrama who had known Devarsay Gowda all his life, he was deeply affected by the fate that had befallen this great man in his old age. </P>
      <P>“I’ll take your word sir,” said the Gowda saluting me with folded hands. “Your house is noble. You have a father – a gray-haired man like me. You have a family. You know what is just and what is unjust. I place my life and my honor in your hands. Your word is all I need.” </P>
      <P>Then turning to the crowd assembled in his house, he addressed them with the air of a king addressing his subjects. </P>
      <P>“O Lachuma! O Poojari! This town has fallen on evil times. All kinds of ugly accusations have been made against my town. I must clear the air and restore our honor. I must now leave. My lord! I’m ready.” </P>
      <P>This led to an uproar. The crowd had jammed the entrance making it impossible for us to leave. I was now getting seriously concerned, and the Holey Narsipur authorities were totally at a loss. Although we had come to arrest him, in reality, we were now completely at the mercy of Devarsay Gowda. Our only safeguard was the Gowda’s own sense of honor and trust, and his authority over his people. The Gowda went to the entrance and spoke summoning his most commanding voice. </P>
      <P>“My fellow children! We are the subjects of our rulers. Over these fifty years, I have faithfully served three kings and our beloved Queen Mother. The Maharaja’s Government is our mother and our father. There have been accusations that some ruffians from our town have been mixed up in the ugly business in Bidirakka. The honor of this fair town is my honor. If my town is dishonored, what is my life worth? I’m going to try and save our good name; in my absence don’t do anything to bring us down. Our Subedar – Navaratna Rao Sahib – is our King’s representative. He is fair and noble – our lord and our justice. What have we to fear? You just go to your homes and await my return. When my children are back in town, tell them what I just told you. God is great.” </P>
      <P>Then placing upon his head a turban brought to him by a lady of the house, he turned to me and said: “Let’s go my lord!” </P>
      <P>We went to the Traveler’s Bungalow followed by hundreds of people. The Gowda stepped on to the verandah and seated himself on a seat covered with a carpet specially prepared for him. The policemen at the bungalow stood up and bowed to him, treating him with utmost deference. It was fortunate that we had decided not to handcuff him. I have to wonder if any policeman would have laid a hand on the Patel. The front yard was full of commotion, with a large crowd milling around. I was occupied discussing our next course with Narayan Rao. He and I both felt that Devarsay Gowda should be released on bond on his own word, but the Holey Narsipur Amildar was not agreeable. </P>
      <P>As this was being debated, the police Jemadar whispered to me, “Look sir! Mr. Kaley Gowda,” and pointed to someone in the crowd. I turned around but failed to see Kaley Gowda, Devarsay Gowda’s son. If in fact he had been there, he had melted into the crowd. </P>
      <P>“He was there just a moment ago sir,” said the Jemadar. </P>
      <P>“Did you see him?” I asked Narayan Rao. </P>
      <P>He shook his head. The Amildar had his back to the crowd and had seen nothing. In any case he didn’t know Kaley Gowda by sight. </P>
      <P>This incident became a sticky point in the trial that followed. Kaley Gowda claimed that he had been away at Mandya and other places during the crime and didn’t return for several weeks. But the police Jemadar had written in the station log that he had pointed him out to me in the crowd at the Traveler’s Bungalow, but had failed to record that neither I nor Narayan Rao saw him. I have no way now of knowing if it was a deliberate omission or just an oversight; I am inclined to think it was just a slip. When the case came to trial, there were strong suggestions that I should testify as actually having seen Kaley Gowda on that day. My refusal to do so led to some coolness in the relationship between me and a friend that lasted quite a while. </P>
      <P>Devarsay Gowda was arrested but released on bond. I handed over all my records to the Hassan authorities and stayed out of the case. Kantha Raje Urs indicated to me that the Hassan authorities were unhappy with my aggressive role in what they regarded as their turf. They seemed to feel that I had upstaged them, though without my defusing the tense situation in Saligrama, they may well have walked into disaster. The Hassan DC Mr. K.R. Srinivas Iyengar presided over the preliminary hearing and committed the case to the Sessions Court. The presiding judge at the Sessions Court was Mr. Param Shivaiah with whom I had an amusing encounter. I’ll relate it shortly. <SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>I was called in to testify in both the courts. My family and I made the trip to Hassan by ox-cart, stopping in Holey Narsipur, and meeting </P>
      <P>T. Param Shivaiah was the father of the famous Kannada playwright T.P. Kailasam. He was also a remarkably original Vedic scholar who anticipated some discoveries that came to light much later. </P>
      <P>several old friends from my Madras Law College days along the way. Upon reaching Hassan, I also met the DC K.R. Srinivas Iyengar first making his acquaintance in the city club before seeing him officially in court. A friend of mine who had worked for him had told me that Mr. Iyengar was a very brilliant man who ruled his district with the authority and dignity reminiscent of the Commission days. When I met him for the first time, he might have been a little displeased with me for interfering in a case in his district. My impression of him at that time was – he was certainly able and intelligent, but not any more than I was. As for being proud – well, why shouldn’t he be? I knew how proud I was in my office of Amildar. He had youth, authority, and excellent career prospects. Over the years, I got to know him better and began to appreciate his many fine qualities. I later had the opportunity of working with him first as his subordinate, and later as a colleague. Now in my autumn years, it is a source of pride and happiness to me that I have his friendship. </P>
      <P>The case proceeded relatively smoothly and sentences were handed out. I cannot recall now if anyone received the death penalty. Several were acquitted – among them Devarsay Gowda and his son Kaley Gowda, which made me happy. During the trial, the turf battles between Mysore and Hassan districts, as well those between my taluk and Holey Narsipur taluk were needlessly dragged into the case. The prosecution tried to pin on me the blame for their delay in the investigation, claiming that I had complicated the case for them by arresting innocent persons including Devarsay Gowda and his son. This was a complete reversal of their own earlier position when they had tried very hard to implicate Kaley Gowda and failed. </P>
      <P>The sessions judge Mr. Param Shivaiah, though critical of the Hassan authorities, seemed ambivalent about my role in the case, or my ‘interference’ as the Hassan authorities termed it. </P>
      <P>“When nothing was done for three or four days,” he wrote in his judgment, “until the Yedatore Amildar took matters into his own hands, was it such a bad thing for him to interfere? Or, would it have been better to ignore the whole thing, even when such a serious crime had taken place?” </P>
      <P>Nonetheless he wrote as follows in his final judgment: </P>
      <P>“Mr. Navaratna Rama Rao, the highly intelligent and energetic Amildar of Yedatore, has the tactless impetuosity of youth and precipitated matters.” </P>
      <P>The presiding judge later claimed that he intended this to be read as a compliment to me. But I failed to see it in that light at the time. I have attempted here to reproduce his comments verbatim from a judgment I last saw nearly fifty years ago. Still, I am fairly certain that my recollection is close to what he actually wrote. I have certainly not forgotten anything complimentary he said about me, but my memory may have diluted his criticism. In any event, these comments came to my office for explanation through the district magistrate’s office. It wasn’t clear to me what sort of “explanation” was called for. So, I wrote the following word-by-word analysis of his statement. </P>
      <ol>
        <LI>“Youth” – I plead guilty, but fail to see how I can be held responsible for it. </LI>
        <LI>“Intelligence, ability” – If I have them, it is God’s grace. I am grateful for the recognition, but can offer no examples. </LI>
        <LI>“Precipitate action” – The honorable judge himself has criticized the prosecution for taking no action until I entered the case. It is my experience that vigorous, perhaps even precipitate action is needed to overcome inaction and inertia. If I have been wrong, I crave the judge’s pardon. </LI>
      </ol>
      <P>This eventually made its way to the desk of Justice Param Shivaiah. We were both members of the Cosmopolitan Club in Mysore. Shortly after this case had been closed, I was playing bridge at the Club when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around and saw the Justice standing behind me with a big grin on his face. </P>
      <P>“Splendid!” he laughed. “I had thought that impertinence was in danger of becoming extinct with my generation. Having seen you, I see now my fears were unfounded. I received your thanks for my generous comments. Now you have my thanks for your comments.” </P>
      <P>For Patel Devarsay Gowda, the episode had exacted a heavy price. Though cleared of any involvement in the crime, his failure as a servant of the king to report his knowledge of the crime was a serious dereliction of duty. I was left with no option but recommend his removal from office. He had placed loyalty to his men above his official duties; they were his people and he had to protect them at all costs. In the end, this noble chief of his ancient clan, this proud holder of the hereditary chieftainship which his family had enjoyed for generations, had, through his own acts of blindness, deprived himself and his descendants of the fruits of his ancestors. </P>
      <P>It was a tragedy both in the Greek and the Shakespearean sense: the gods were against him, but he was betrayed no less by his own faults and his virtues. </P>

      <H3>19 NOBILITY KNOWS NO LIMITS </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Rama Rao is transferred to T. Narsipur taluk. Taking leave of Yedatore. His last meeting with Devarsay Gowda. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Shortly after the Bidirakka case had been settled, I received official notice of transfer to Tirumkudla Narsipur, better known as T. Narsipur as Amildar. T. Narsipur, not to be confused with Holey Narsipur in Hassan district where the riot took place, was in Mysore district, which meant I would still be reporting to Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs. I have earlier related the incident in which I had to deal with the troublemaker Basava Rajappa during the Maharaja’s circuit trip to Narsipur; I would now be in charge of that taluk. While serving as Amildar of Narsipur, I had the honor of playing host to the Maharaja’s mother, Her Highness Vani Vilas, when she visited my taluk. It was a memorable occasion that I have reserved for a later time. </P>
      <P>It was not exactly a promotion, but decidedly a more responsible position. Narsipur taluk was more urban than Yedatore, with nearly twice the population and three times the revenue. But over the past several years, the administration of Narsipur taluk had taken a turn for the worse with the result both revenue collection and the law and order situation had suffered. I was told by the Diwan’s office that I had been put in charge of the taluk precisely because of my excellent record in Yedatore in both revenue matters and law enforcement. I also received a substantial salary increase. It is interesting that though Diwan V.P. Madhava Rao freely acknowledged my talents, he refused to promote me for purely personal reasons. This pattern was to persist even after he himself went on record stating that, my administration in Narsipur was the best in the state. But that is a different story that I’ll reserve for later. </P>
      <P>When word of my transfer got around, the people of Yedatore – especially the poor and the peasants – overwhelmed me with their expressions of love, respect, and gratitude. There was a regular stream of visitors from all over the taluk, many of whom had travelled miles to wish me good fortune. I was greatly touched by their expressions of affection, making me at times unable to speak. </P>
      <P>“What is it I have done?” I kept wondering, “that would not have been done by anyone else in my position?” I was after all, a relatively junior official, and it was not as though I was Amildar by birth. Who all had I saved? All I had done was to exercise what God had given me to the best of my ability, to serve my king and his subjects. </P>
      <P>These expressions of love, respect, and the gifts they brought me, were truly a reflection of the generosity of our people who return every small kindness tenfold. With the passage of time, I recognize now that the two years or so that I had served in Yedatore were the absolute springtime of my life. I had not yet suffered any heartbreaking bereavements or disappointments so massive as to make life seem futile.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>Now in my golden years, my life like anyone else’s has known its share of happiness and sorrow, but God in his infinite generosity has blessed me with happiness and fortune that is beyond my due. Even now, when I reflect back on those days, the memories fill me with feelings of joy and serenity like upon entering a garden in springtime or a moonlit harvest night. </P>
      <P>A couple of days before I was to leave Yedatore, I had an experience that truly filled me with awe and has remained an imperishable part of my life. It was early in the evening, and I was busy packing a few final items in preparation for our departure. A messenger came in and announced that Patel Devarsay Gowda had come to see me. The Bidirakka case had been settled about two months earlier, and I had not seen him since. Also, as I have already related, I had him removed from office for his failure to report the crime. What a blow this must have been to this proud man whose family had enjoyed the position of Patel of Saligrama from time immemorial can be imagined. At first I thought he must have come to vent his anger upon me and avenge his recent humiliation, knowing full well that I would be gone. My initial impulse was to deny him the opportunity by refusing to see him. I then felt it </P>
      <P>He had lost his close friend Dasappa of Hadya in a drowning accident, but it was nothing when compared to the loss of his beloved wife Kashija Bai in 1910. </P>
      <P>would be cowardly for me to refuse him – an old man with whom I had been through so much – denying him his last wish. If I had to take some abuse, it was nothing compared to his own misfortune in which I had an unhappy hand. </P>
      <P>I sent word with the messenger to invite the Gowda and his party in. I received him and his entourage consisting of two boys – a grandson and a servant – in my living room. He approached me and saluted me with a deep bow, his hands almost touching the ground. I was shaken by the extent of transformation in his appearance, and deeply touched by his gesture. Within the past few months, his once powerful and vigorous body had shrunk, and he had fallen abruptly into old age. He was an elderly man, about my father’s age; and the sight of this man, so ravaged by misfortune, and yet coming all the way to pay me his respects was an experience that I have no words to describe. </P>
      <P>I stood up to receive him. Taking both of his hands in mine, I said, “Sir! To what do I owe the honor of your visit?” </P>
      <P>He was quiet for a moment, then cleared his throat and said, “I heard, my lord – you’re taking leave of us. I have not many years left. I don’t know when I shall see you again. I just came to pay my respects, wish you happiness, and receive your lordship’s blessings.” <SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>“Sir, you are a great man,” I said speaking with great difficulty. “And what you just said reflects nobly on your ancient house. Everything about you fills me with awe and humility. What have I ever done to merit this generosity? It was my misfortune to be the one responsible for your misfortune. But it is some consolation to me that your good name was cleared of any taint in that dreadful crime.” </P>
      <P>“Why do you blame yourself for my fate?” he replied, dismissing my clumsy attempt at an apology. “You kept your word. I left my life and my honor in your hands – and you preserved them. My misfortune was of my own making. The Gods were against me.” </P>
      <P>Normally, it would be improper and impious for an older man like Devarsay Gowda to be seeking Rama Rao’s blessings, but the latter belonged to a family of Uttaradhi Math seers or Guru Vamsha – meaning ‘Sacred Teacher’s Family’. </P>
      <P>I was stunned. His noble soul saw only the good in others, never an injury. Perhaps that was his undoing. </P>
      <P>“May the good Lord bring you, your wife, and your children all the happiness,” he continued, “I have brought some parting gifts. You must honor me by accepting them.” </P>
      <P>He then turned to the two boys who were waiting behind him and gestured to them to bring the gifts to me. They came forward, carrying two silver platters containing fruits, coconuts, betel leaves, and other such offerings of respect customary in those days. I tried to say some words of thanks, but found myself unable to speak. I received them, without a word. </P>
      <P>I then accompanied the Gowda, my arm on his shoulder, down the steps leading to the street in front of my house. We then shook hands and bowed and saluted each other with folded hands. He turned away and walked down the street to his ox-cart parked at the end of the street, without once looking back. This once robust man now looked gaunt but walked with a firm step, with his head unbowed. I saw him reappear from the evening shadows and then disappear into his covered ox-wagon. </P>
      <P>I never saw him again. </P>
      <P>

      <H3>20 AN UNUSUAL DINNER </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>SDO V.N. Iyer and his ‘old rats’. Rama Rao’s last meeting with Diwan Krishna Murthy. An unusual dinner. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>As previously noted I was transferred to Tirumakudla Narsipur </P>
      <P>(T. Narsipur) as Amildar. In the few days ‘joining leave’ that I had before reporting for my new position, I handed over charge to my successor in Yedatore and stopped in Mysore to visit my father. Traveling with my family, I next stopped for a few days in Nanjangud on the way to T. Narsipur. I wanted to offer worship at the famous Nanjundeshwara Temple. Nanjangud was also the headquarters of my subdivision officer (SDO) Vaidya Natha Iyer (V.N. Iyer) who had asked me to see him before assuming charge in Narsipur. We stayed as guests of the Nanjangud Amildar Dharma Rao – a dear friend of mine. </P>
      <P>I went to see SDO V.N. Iyer. He was the brother-in-law of the famous Diwan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer. He owed his position entirely to this family connection for he was not a particularly able official. I had seen him in a few meetings in Mysore but had made no effort to get to know him. He was a very orthodox Iyer aged about 53 or 54 – nearly twice my age. He was extremely devout and spent the better part of his morning in prayer and ritual. I had also heard that he was a Shakteya— or a follower of the Shakti cult. </P>
      <P>As an official he was not distinguished in any way. He was a weak man, easily influenced by others, with little judgment of his own. I had also heard that a couple veteran clerks, ‘old rats’ they were called, practically ran the office. They were in attendance when I went to see the SDO. They treated me with extreme courtesy, bordering on unction, which put me on guard. The SDO, V.N. Iyer, received me cordially and said that the administration in Narsipur, the taluk that I was about to take over as Amildar, had greatly suffered in recent years. </P>
      <P>“Weak officials have allowed the administration to go slack,” he told me. “Your first responsibility is to bring it back into shape. You can expect my full support in this regard.” His clerks, the ‘old rats’, also nodded sagely in assent. I thanked him and got up to leave. As I was leaving, the SDO invited me to dine with him at half past eight the following evening; I accepted. </P>
      <P>My senior friend Diwan Krishna Murthy happened to be in Nanjangud on the way to his jagir or ancestral estate of Yelandur. He was staying with a relative (and family retainer) by name Guru Rao. I went to see him. He was seated with a shawl wrapped around his shoulders in the hall of Guru Rao’s house, in a large chair stacked with cushions. I had not seen him in a couple of years. In these years he had gone down a lot. Understandably, there was little of the energy or the force of authority of his earlier days, but what I saw in his face seemed to indicate a loss of interest in the world; he seemed almost to be resigned to his fate. I had heard that this health had not been good; his appearance too suggested the same thing. </P>
      <P>As soon as I saw him, a sense of profound regard, combined with a certain compassion for his current condition, welled up within me. On an impulse I prostrated myself before him, in the manner of saluting my father and other elders. This was entirely spontaneous. No one could accuse me of having any ulterior motives. I still feel a sense of righteousness whenever I recall it, for I never saw Krishna Murthy again. (He died in 1912.) </P>
      <P>“This is highly improper, Rao Sahib of Navaratna”, he protested, “Please rise. You are the scion of a holy family; a family touched by God. You should not be saluting a common man like me in this manner.” He was referring to the fact that a few members of the </P>
      <P>Navaratna family had been pontiffs of the Madhva Uttaradhi Mutt of which Krishna Murthy and his family were devout followers. The best known of them was Satya Dharma Teertha, a contemporary of the famous Diwan Purnaiah, Krishna Murthy’s own great-greatgrandfather. </P>
      <P>“Sir, you became Diwan following in the footsteps of your great ancestor,” I said with affected humor, “but I didn’t follow my elders and take holy orders. My father has high regard for you. I have heard that your family has been generous in supporting our ancestors in the discharge of their duties.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>You made it possible for me to serve in my present position. So, my respect for you is both inherited and earned.” </P>
      <P>These words came from my heart. After some discussion about our families and other mundane matters, the Diwan asked me, “Are you willing to come to Yelandur as Amildar? We need a strong man like you there. The Government has agreed to appoint anyone I ask for.” </P>
      <P>I told him that I would think about his offer and let him know. I saluted him again and took his leave. </P>
      <P>I wrote him later rejecting his offer. Yelandur was a small taluk in an obscure corner of the state. Anyone going there as Amildar would fall out of sight, without a future. The taluk was practically an extension of the jagirdar’s (Krishna Murthy’s) family court, infested with an army of relatives and family retainers. These did little beyond nursing grudges and hatching plots that would put Chanakya to shame. If the Amildar failed to please each and every one of the parties, the dispute would be taken to the jagirdar himself. No self-respecting official could function under such a regime. I would sooner be swimming in shark-infested waters than deal with these members of the idle class. </P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier the SDO had asked me for dinner at half past eight. It so transpired that my host Dharma Rao had also arranged a dinner reception for me at the same time. As I had already promised the SDO, I begged Dharma Rao to postpone it to the following day. He was disappointed but agreed. </P>
      <P>Rama Rao’s ancestors used to be heads of a religious cum educational foundation near Devanahalli, north of Bangalore. Krishna Murthy ‘s family, which was very wealthy, had made several donations to it. </P>
      <P>“So you are going to pass up the sumptuous feast I had planned for you,” he joked, “for the insipid fare to be dished out by that old puritan.” I replied I had no choice. </P>
      <P>I showed up at SDO V.N. Iyer’s door at half past eight sharp. A servant boy opened the door and said, “The Sahib has had his dinner and gone to bed.” </P>
      <P>I was startled. “Why, is he unwell?” I asked. “No sir,” the boy replied, “it is normal for the Sahib to dine at eight and retire to bed immediately. He stays up a little longer when there is some work to be done. Should I tell him anything?” </P>
      <P>“Nothing important, really. Please tell him in the morning that I – Amildar of Narsipur – was here at eight thirty as requested by the Sahib.” </P>
      <P>As this was going on, the SDO showed up at the window and said, “Hello, Mr. Rama Rao! What brings you here? Anything new?” </P>
      <P>“Nothing new, sir,” I replied. “Nothing whatsoever. The temple, the river, the mountains – they are all where they have always been. None of them is showing any sign of change. Only I am a bit hungry. You were kind enough to ask me for dinner at half past eight. Well, here I am.” </P>
      <P>Not knowing whether to be angry or amused at the absurd situation I found myself in, what I said must have sounded a little bitter and sarcastic to the poor old man. He was thoroughly flabbergasted. </P>
      <P>“O, my God!” he exclaimed, almost collapsing with embarrassment. “I completely forgot. Sir, please come in.” Then, calling to his servant, “Get some light. Where is Seshaiyer? Seshaiyer, O! Seshaiyer! Are you alive or dead? You please come in, sir.” </P>
      <P>Seshaiyer the cook came running in, half-dressed, chewing paan. </P>
      <P>V.N. Iyer turned to me and said, “Please be seated, sir. Food will be ready in a few minutes – as we are talking about a few things.” Then turning to the cook, “Some rice, rasam or sambar, but be quick about it. Fry some papad and vada – and some pickle. Let’s see how fast you can make it.” </P>
      <P>By then my annoyance had completely vanished in the face of my host’s predicament; only the humor of the situation remained. </P>
      <P>“Believe it or not,” he said, “it completely slipped out of my mind. Ladies are out of town. This wouldn’t have happened if they had been home. Still, when I sat down for dinner, something seemed to be amiss – as if I had forgotten something." </P>
      <P>“I couldn’t forget, my tummy kept reminding me,” I replied. “But why go to all this trouble. My host Dharma Rao and his family will not have eaten yet. I can go join them for dinner.” </P>
      <P>“How is that possible Mr. Rama Rao!” he said in shock. “It is a great sin to turn back a guest on an empty stomach. An invited guest is like God’s own visit.” And so on and so forth. </P>
      <P>Of course, God is always happy, presumably with an eternally full stomach, but I was famished. I did not insist too much. Having already asked Dharma Rao to postpone his dinner, I didn’t want to go back for dinner and face possible ridicule. Also, poor old V.N. Iyer was almost prostrate with embarrassment, and I didn’t have the heart to make it worse for him. There was also an element of stubbornness, that I should make him treat me to dinner – having invited me and made me cancel another program. It was nine-thirty or ten by the time I was served dinner. The food was quite good – or so it seemed to my empty stomach. The servings were generously spiced with the Sahib’s apologies. </P>
      <P>It was nearly eleven by the time I finished dinner and went back to Dharma Rao’s house. “Were you eating all this time?” Dharma Rao asked in amazement. “It must have been quite a feast.” </P>
      <P>“An extraordinary meal,” I replied, “with papad, many types of pickles, great profusion of apologies, etc, etc. Mostly apologies and etceteras. Estimate at five minutes per item and you’ll see why it took so long. I know you have a good head for counting.” </P>
      <P>Dharma Rao looked puzzled but didn’t say anything. The next day </P>
      <P>V.N. Iyer himself related what happened to him. </P>

      <H3>21 NARSIPUR, PEOPLE, AND PRACTICES </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Different perceptions of Narsipur. The two main communities. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Following my transfer to Narsipur, I made an effort to learn as much as possible about the place and its people. I contacted a few of my friends and acquaintances that had served there. The results proved more entertaining than enlightening. A frustrated man who thought he was too old to enjoy life by the time he was posted there told me, “You are lucky I must say to be going there when you are still young. You can really enjoy life.” Another said, “It’s a horrid place. Murders at every turn, piles of anonymous petitions, factions and rivalries in every village and town. Count yourself lucky if you have any reputation left by the time you finish your term there.” Yet another told me, “It is a heavenly place – with nothing to do except bathe in the river and worship at the temples. It is like ashramas of ancient rishis.” I suppose there was the service of apsaras in ancient ashramas. <SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The Amildar who handed over charge to me was more specific. “It is a troublesome charge,” he told me. “There are large villages and towns with self-important and scheming individuals. They take almost every case to Mysore or Najangud. The subdivision also tends to interfere in the taluk administration rather too much.” He then mentioned the name of the Patel of a village near Nanjangud by name and said, “He is very influential in some circles and somewhat fond of intrigues. If you happen to cross him you can expect some trouble. He may try to get you a bad name in a hurry.” </P>
      <P>For all this trouble I had learnt that Narsipur was as pleasant as spring, hot like summer, and as peaceful as autumn. These qualities can be found in all the taluks in the state. All it means is that we tend to find what we seek. This reminds me of an episode from my student days in </P>
      <P>‘Ashrama’ is a hermitage in a secluded area. Rishi is a sage and apsara a nymph. </P>
      <P>the Law College, in Madras. A young businessman from one of the small southern towns came to our hotel, and with an expression of utter disgust on his face, said, “What is this wonderful Madras everyone is talking about? This is a wretched, rotten place.” Someone asked him what made him so despondent. </P>
      <P>“I was told in my hometown that in Madras, golden girls will be looking at you from balcony windows. They will come down on their own and talk to young men wandering in the streets. For the last three days I have worn out three pairs of slippers walking the streets of Madras, and not a soul cared to find out if I am alive or dead.” </P>
      <P>He must have received an excessively rosy picture of Madras from a more than ordinarily romantic soul. </P>
      <P>From my own experience I did not find Narsipur to be all that different from other taluks of Mysore that I knew. But – and I say this with some hesitation, but it must be said – weak administration over the past several years both at the taluk and the subdivision level had allowed a crop of local leaders to sprout and set up power centers. This is always the case; society, no less than nature, abhors a vacuum. Here it was a case of local leaders rising up to fill a power vacuum. </P>
      <P>The town of T. Narsipur, the taluk seat, sits at the junction of two rivers – the Kaveri and the Kabini. Area north of the Kabini River was dominated by the Vokkaliga community similar in most ways to the Vokkaligas of Yedatore that I was familiar with. The southern part of the taluk – south of the Kabini – was the stronghold of the Veerashaivas.<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>I found a distinct difference in the attitude and conduct of the two dominant communities. This is just my personal observation that could be limited to the time and place of my experience. Here it is for what it is worth. </P>
      <P>Known also as Shivacharas. They are followers of the sect founded by the 12th century religious and social reformer Basava. They started out as a reaction against the Brahminical practices and the caste system of the day, but later became a caste themselves. They have traditionally been hostile to Brahmins. Rama Rao was to later marry a Lingayat woman himself – a radical step in those days for a Brahmin. </P>
      <P>Both the communities were brave and industrious, but the Vokkaligas had an ingrained respect for the Government and its institutions.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>They were for the most part law-abiding people, straight and open in their dealings. Hardworking and frugal by nature, unostentatious in dress, they followed a simple lifestyle. Conservative by nature, they held Brahmins in high regard; I am speaking of course of those days in the early years of the century. In any event there was little of the caste-related rivalry that was to come to the fore in later years. As the great majority of Shanbogs were Brahmins, they were often consulted on matters relating to business and even domestic affairs, and their advice usually followed. A strong bond of tradition and respect existed between the Brahmins and the Vokkaligas. </P>
      <P>The people living in the southern part of Narsipur taluk – mostly Veerashaivas – were more prosperous than the Vokkaligas to the north of the river. The reason was the wealth brought by the silk industry.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>Where the Vokkaligas of the north were mainly agriculturists, almost every household in the south was engaged in silk-rearing. The larger villages also had facilities for bulk production of silk yarn and of course silk trade. As a result, where the Vokkaliga villages had the look of peasant settlements, Veerashaiva villages were prosperous little towns. This was reflected in their dress and lifestyle, which resembled that of larger towns like Mysore and Najangud. Each village in these parts was like a small feudal estate. The silk business provided opportunities for moneylenders, with some of them becoming lakhiers and millionaires, gaining recognition as sahukars (capitalists). Several of them had accumulated substantial wealth through trade in places like Bangalore and Kollegal. </P>
      <P>The influence of Brahmins in this part of the taluk, dominated as it was by the Veerashaivas, was slight. To begin with, Brahmins, engaged in traditional activities, tended to be less prosperous. The Veerashaivas who constituted the majority in these parts were not only indifferent to the Brahmins, but also carried the historic hostility of their faith. Since </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>It should be noted that the highest government official at the village level, the patel, was invariably a Vokkaliga. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>This was in addition to agriculture, which was the mainstay of the taluk. The Narsipur taluk, watered by two rivers, is extremely fertile. </P>
      <P>the Veerashaiva sect was born as a revolt against Brahmins, this hostility was only natural. I am not suggesting that it was unfair or unnatural, but only stating what I saw. This sometimes had a negative effect on the administration in these parts. Since the Patel tended to be a follower of the Veerashaiva sect and the Shanbog usually a Brahmin, the situation was tailor made for rival factions. <SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Before coming to Narsipur, I had heard that jangamas wielded enormous power over the people of these parts. There were stories that people regarded such men as ‘walking Gods’, and surrendered to them body and soul. I had also been told that most of these men were impostors who took advantage of the blind faith of women to satisfy their needs. I had difficulty believing such stories. Even if half of them were true, these mendicants must be monsters and the people all fools. This could only be a caricature, far removed from reality. Their conduct and morality could not be all that different from ours. They must have good and bad people, saints and charlatans, in more or less the same proportion as the rest of the population. </P>
      <P>A French missionary by name Abbe Dubois visited these parts in the early years of the nineteenth century and left a record of his experiences in a famous book, which is often taken to be an authoritative account of the life and practices of its people. It contains a detailed account of the Mudukutore jatra – an important event for the Veerashaivas of these parts. According to his account, the Mudukutore jatra was a hotbed of sin and licentiousness. Reading him made me wonder if such practices could exist in any society. I suspected that he was actually describing his own fantasies growing out of the suppressed desires of a Christian monk condemned to a life of celibacy. </P>
      <P>This was confirmed later, when I had to be at the Mudukutore jatra in my official capacity as Amildar, in charge of security and other arrangements. I then had the opportunity to observe the people at first hand. I then said to myself, “O poor, wretched Dubois! Why did you have to come all the way here – to satisfy your needs by venting your </P>
      <P>Veerashaiva sect is followed by some Vokkaligas also, especially in places where it is strong. As a result, patels, though belonging to the Vokkaliga community could be followers of the Veershaiva faith. But typically they tended to be nonsectarian. </P>
      <P>frustrations and abusing the simple, harmless folk of our villages! Could you not have stayed in your own country and satisfied your desires at the various carnivals that are closer to your own fantasies?” <SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The truth is that the people who attend the Mudukutore jatra bear no resemblance to the grotesque caricatures found in Dubois’ book. The pilgrims that I came to know at the jatra were true devotees, filled with joy and simple-hearted devotion for their favourite deity. And the jangamas that I saw, far from being cunning scoundrels, were the simplest souls one could imagine. They had no sense of the real world. I cannot think of anyone less fitted to advise others of the affairs of the world than these illiterate men. All the ‘influence’ they commanded earned them a serving of food at mealtime or a bowl of rice or a few annas from a compassionate soul. They commanded some affection – more often pity – from the people, but little respect and certainly no authority. The real villains of this society were the sophisticated, unscrupulous men of the world, familiar with the courts and government procedures of Mysore and Nanjangud who didn’t hesitate to prey on the ignorance of the common people. </P>
      <P>Farmers of these villages are very fine people. Good-looking, powerfully-built men, but for reasons that I could never fathom, quick to anger, and, when angry, prone to lose all sense of proportion. In a situation where a normally quick-tempered man might slap, these men would deliver a blow with an axe or a machete. I recall an incident when a gentle-faced youth lost his temper in an argument, and cut down two men and then surrendered himself to the police. In response to a question during the autopsy he simply said, “I don’t know why I did this, sir. I guess I lost my temper.” He spoke as though such behavior was nothing unnatural – something anyone in his position might have done. And he was by no means alone in those parts. </P>
      <P>Members of other communities in the area – kurubas, parivaras, adikarnatakas and a few others – looked upon the Veerashaivas as leaders </P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many modern sociologists take Du Bois’s account as an accurate description of society at that time. This simple debunking by Rama Rao, based on first hand observation, should serve as a corrective. What Du Bois has given is a caricature of people he saw as ‘heathens’, colored by the prejudices of a Christian missionary. </P>
      <P>and followed them in their own living style and habits. This applied in general to the areas south of the Kabini (and the Kaveri), in places like Kasaba and Moogur and those east of the Kaveri river like Talkad; similar conditions prevailed in Nanjangud, Chamarajnagar, Yelandur, and Kollegal – the last in the then Madras Province. </P>
      <P>I loved these people. “This is truly sanctified, heroic, land,” I felt, “and its people are the heroic subjects of our kings.” Good health and active living combined with good blood had given these men and women the energy and the enthusiasm to enjoy life. They had also a capacity to see the absurd and the humorous in things. This sometimes helped in turning a potentially ugly situation into a harmless farce. I recall one incident in particular. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>During the huzur jamabandi the subdivision officer (SDO) and I happened to be camping in a village. The SDO was camped in a grove outside the village, while I was put up in the schoolhouse in the middle of the town. At about two in the morning, I was awakened by a large commotion not far from where I was sleeping. I sent my orderly to the spot on the main road – the village had a single main road – to find out the cause of the commotion. The orderly came back to me reported that one of the SDO’s servants – a vagrant boy in his early twenties who fancied himself a ladies’ man – had tried to molest Patel Siddamalliah’s wife and had got caught in the act. I was horrified knowing the hair-trigger temper of these villagers. Throwing a shawl around my shoulders, I rushed to the spot to prevent the disaster that I thought was sure to happen. </P>
      <P>No one recognized me in the dim light of the street lanterns as I made my way to the place, opposite the Patel’s house. As I reached the spot, the commotion turned into a chorus of guffaws and hearty laughter. The spectacle unfolding before my eyes made me also join in the general laughter. There were some twenty or thirty men with shawls and blankets around their shoulders laughing uncontrollably. A tall, middle-aged woman of imposing presence – built like Goddess Chamudeshwari – was holding by the neck a small, befuddled, consumptive-looking young man with disheveled hair, who was stammering incoherently. The Gowda – obviously the proud husband of the woman – was laughing loudest of all. Then, holding both wrists of the consumptive boy in a single massive hand, she roughly pushed up the chin of the hapless youth and ordered him, “Show your pretty face to everyone, you bastard!” </P>
      <P>Here is the account with which she edified the assembled citizens. </P>
      <P>“In the dead of night I heard a knock on the door, and someone saying, ‘Open the door.’ Taking it to be my husband returning from his trip to Moogur, I opened the door. It was this little runt. He came into the house and said, ‘Shut the door, shut it.’ He had been here a few times before – for supplies of milk and butter for the SDO Sahib. ‘What is the matter, this late in the night?’ I asked him. Without a word, he tried to grab my breasts. I grabbed his hands, and told him, ‘You consumptive little brat! You came to me for this? If a brat like you were to swallow one mouthful of milk from my breasts, you’ll go into contortions, curl up, and die. And you came here to molest me!’ Then I gave him a sound thrashing and dragged him out into the street. As he was screaming for help, a few people came to check what was happening. As I was about to hand him over to them, the Gowda – my husband – also returned. This worm, this insect – is it proper for it to behave like this?” </P>
      <P>Her husband was a man of over six feet, of full, powerful build with a sweeping moustache – an impressive figure of masculinity. The spectacle of this imposing couple and a little fellow drawn to her like a moth to a fire – was enough to feed anyone’s mirth. </P>
      <P>What to do with the culprit? “Let us shave off his brows and his head,” said one. “Or how about parading him on a donkey with slippers around his neck.” Finally, a moderate voice, it sounded like the Patel’s, said, “What is all this nonsense? The Subedar and SDO Sahib are both in town. Do you want all of us to go to jail and drag this honorable woman to court? Let us just kick the bastard out of town.” </P>
      <P>Then holding the little fellow by the neck, Patel Siddamallaiah, the husband of the offended lady, delivered three solid kicks to the buttocks, releasing his hold on the fellow’s neck to synchronize with the third. As if loathe to lose the momentum of the kicks, the poor little fellow took off like a rocket and disappeared into the night. The crowd also dispersed. </P>
      <P>Within a short time, I developed a close bond of friendship and mutual regard with the Veerashaiva people of Narsipur taluk. It grew to the point that they would voluntarily follow my directions even in matters outside my official duties. I will relate later the story of the restoration of the historic temples carried out by these people under my direction.<SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN> During the restoration work, which involved excavating the temples that had been buried in the sand dumped by the rivers, a thousand volunteers from all the villages worked by turns for nearly a month to complete the work. This was testimony to their devotion to God and their affection for me; there was no compulsion on my part. Not being part of my official work, I could not demand anything. Thanks to their devotion these historic temples, buried so deep in the sand that even their peaks could not be seen, are now back in service following royal consecration. </P>
      <P>Seeing this extraordinary devotion, a senior friend of mine who was </P>
      <P>8</P>
      <P>visiting the place joked, “In the old days, you could have ruled the place as a feudal lord.” </P>
      <P>“Their affection is like a tax due to the rulers,” I retorted. “Like all other levies, I hand this over to the Maharaja. I am receiving this bounty only because I am his representative.” </P>
      <P>When I look back to those days, there are times when I can scarcely believe how lavishly I have been blessed with love and friendship. This, like wealth, is a gift of God. It may be bestowed on an undeserving individual, or a deserving one may not be so fortunate. In my case I feel it is due to the simple fact that I have always treated everyone as an individual, without the slightest regard for caste or community. And people have responded in kind. </P>
      <P>This explains, I think, why the Veerashaivas followed me and supported me, in spite of my being a Brahmin.<SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN>I believe that the Veerashaiva sect was born as a reaction against some social evils then </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>These are famous as the pancha linga – five Shiva temples – sacred to the Veerashaivas. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>This ‘senior friend’ was Councilor Srinivasa Iyengar. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN>Rama Rao was a Madhva Brahmin, and therefore a Vaishnava, traditionally opposed by the Shaivas of which the Veerashaivas may be seen as the most extreme representatives. </P>
      <P>prevailing, as a movement to cleanse the society of some of its undesirable practices. I respect their holy places and also their saints and leaders. I am naturally partial to simple-hearted people. My philosophy, as I received from my teachers, is to use my God-given talents to discharge my duties to the best of my ability without fear or favor. I know that several others who have tried to follow this simple principle have come to grief, but, in this regard, I can only say that have been more fortunate than most. </P>
      <P>All this of course applies to the ordinary people of the region; this is not to say that the place was free from schemers and troublemakers inclined to mischief. Upon hearing of my transfer to Narsipur, several of these parties made inquiries about my background, trying to learn as much as possible about my method of administration as well as my personal likes and dislikes. They seem to have contacted some Mysore lawyers who had appeared in cases before me for the purpose. I give below the picture that emerged from these inquiries, as it came to me via a circuitous route, in particular from two of my friends – Dharma Rao and Venkata Ramana Shrauti. </P>
      <P>I was honest, short-tempered, not easily influenced by others, stubborn, courageous, and cruel but fond of praise. In addition, I was the DC’s favorite Amildar with strong support at the highest levels of the Government. This had made me somewhat arrogant, making me believe that I could do no wrong. But they thought they had also spotted a chink in my armor; I was very fond of music and partial to musicians, especially of the female variety. </P>
      <P>This, of course, was a caricature obtained by exaggerating bits and pieces of information from different sources. The only detail in the picture that was close to truth was my love of music. Music has been a life-long passion with me.<SPAN><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN>As a boy, I used to force my friends to listen to my singing, which often led to fights (I usually prevailed in arguments over my music because of my superior physical strength and I was a good wrestler). As I grew older, it dawned on me that singing was not my forte. I then took up the violin. It is never easy to share a room with someone learning to play the violin. There can be no higher tribute to </P>
      <P>By this Rama Rao means Karnatak or Classical South Indian music. He had little interest in Hindustani (North Indian) music. </P>
      <P>Rajaji’s love for me than the fact that in all the years we were roommates, he never once complained or asked me to stop practicing the violin.<SPAN><Sup>11 </Sup></SPAN>Others, unfortunately, were not so generous. One lady in particular took an extreme step, which prevented me from playing the instrument for several months. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>During our student days in Madras, Rajaji and I shared lodgings at the house of one Gurumurthy Iyer on Tambu Chetty Road. One morning, I pulled out my violin and began to practice the Bhairavi Varna, ‘Veeri Boni’.<SPAN><Sup>12 </Sup></SPAN>One by one the lodgers living on the floor fled from their rooms; only Rajaji held steadfast. But I refused to give up, and redoubled my efforts. I kept playing as if in a trance. After a while, fatigue sent my music wandering from its course – not that it had exactly been on course until then. Just then I heard a knock on my door. It was the maid working for the landlady. </P>
      <P>“My mistress says you have a very good violin,” she told me. “She wants to see it for herself.” Delighted, I handed her the instrument. The landlady promptly locked it in her safe and refused to return it. No amount of pleading from me would make her change the view that I was a public nuisance with the violin. </P>
      <P>Some two months later, as I was about to leave for Mysore following the end of the term, the landlady invited me in. She took out my violin from the safe, tuned it, and played the same ‘Veeri Boni’ with a mastery that would have put many a concert violinist to shame. She then handed the violin back to me and said, “Until your playing reaches the level that I just demonstrated, civilized behavior demands that you practice your violin in a remote place – like a sea shore or a mountaintop. The mountain in your native Mysore might be an ideal place.” </P>
      <P>The poor woman did not know the name of the Chamundi Hill in Mysore. I must apologize for wandering away from the main story. This is from the days when I was my own teacher, i.e. during my student days. Later, when I began working and could afford to pay for lessons, I engaged teachers. As my salary and my authority as an official grew, I </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>11 </Sup></SPAN>This could also be explained by the fact that Rajaji was totally ignorant of </P>
      <P>music. <SPAN><Sup>12 </Sup></SPAN>A famous and erudite composition by the eighteenth century composer </P>
      <P>Pacchimeeriyam Adiyappa. </P>
      <P>noticed a corresponding growth in my skill or at least in the compliments that were showered on my violin playing. But like a true yogi, who attains self-realization, I too realized my true worth as a musician. It rid me of any illusions I might have had that I was a good violinist. <SPAN><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Yet, the years spent in learning to play the violin have not been in vain. It has resulted in a great love of music and a good appreciation of its finer points. I rarely missed recitals by good musicians. I would invite leading musicians to come to my place and arrange concerts. I tried also to encourage up and coming artists. As a result, many of the leading musicians who were active during my long life – from Mysore Vasudevachar, Veena Seshanna, and Tiger Vardachar, to younger artists like Chowdaiah and M.S. Subbu Lakshmi – became my friends. I used to greatly enjoy Bharata Natyam; I was particularly fond of the performance of Jayadeva’s Ashtapadis that combine singing and dancing. These loves have remained with me in old age. </P>
      <P>Rama Rao took delight in denigrating his playing, but he was a fairly good violinist. The great South Indian violin maestro T. Chowdaiah, who came from T. Narsipur and was a friend of the family, once told Rajaram: “Your grandfather was a good violinist, as long as he stuck to pieces he could easily handle.” This can be taken to mean that he was a good amateur violinist whose technique was not up to professional standards. The same can be said of most amateur musicians in the world. </P>

      <H3>22 A COMEDY OF DESIGN </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>A young Amildar becomes the unwitting hero of a romantic farce. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Although there were many similarities between the people of Yedatore and Narsipur, the leaders of the two taluks differed in one important respect. In Yedatore, they would act in the open and show their feelings. In Narsipur, on the other hand, it was not uncommon for some leaders to weave a web of intrigue to get the official concerned to act in their favor or trap him. These could be amusing as long as someone else was the victim. I will illustrate this with a famous episode that had taken place a few years before I took charge. </P>
      <P>In the Narsipur taluk there is a large and prosperous village. (Its name is not needed here.) Its leader was its Patel, a wealthy man famous in these parts as a connoisseur of music and dance. We need not know his name; it suffices to know that he was a generous patron and promoter of artists, especially dancers. The leader of the rival party, as was usual in these parts was the Shanbog. The Amildar of the taluk at the time happened to be a comparatively young man, also fond of music and dance. <SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>This prosperous village, actually a small town, was renowned as the nursery of performing artists, especially dancers. They were greatly in demand all over South India. Thanks to the patronage of wealthy art lovers, landowners, and even minor royalty, some of these women had attained to considerable wealth. This had made the village famous in the state of Mysore and even beyond. A good number of these talented </P>
      <P>Ever since this story appeared in 1952, there has been much speculation over the name of this amildar. Since the episode took place a few years before Rama Rao took charge in Narsipur (1907), it is not especially difficult to determine his identity. Rajaram did find out, but decided that nothing is gained by revealing the name. It would mean nothing to present day readers anyway. </P>
      <P>women, it was said, owed their fame and fortune to the early patronage of the great Patel. This meant that the Patel, an extremely wealthy man, had at his disposal the resources to entertain influential visitors on a lavish scale. His fame had spread far and wide; his lifestyle was the envy of connoisseurs all around. </P>
      <P>His rival the Shanbog, a pedantic Brahmin, had neither the wealth nor the artistic and other resources to match the flamboyant Patel. But what he lacked in style and flair, he made up in cunning – or so his admirers claimed. When it came to wading his way through complicated government procedures, he was said to be without peer. His mastery was such that he could to clear the path for a friend or create obstacles to trip any adversary, or so the people believed. In addition, since most taluk office workers in those days were Brahmins, they used to be fed at his place whenever they happened to be in town at mealtime. This was the practice in those days. As a result, the Shanbog was well-informed about the goings on in the taluk office, and commanded considerable influence in its affairs. This at least was the image he had carefully cultivated, which may or may not have been true. </P>
      <P>In the inevitable division of the village, the Veerashaivas and their followers were with the Patel, while the Brahmins and the Kurubas were on the side of the Shanbog. Among the Harijans (Dalits) also there were two parties – the ‘Rightists’ and the ‘Leftists’; the former followed the Patel whereas the latter were followers of the Shanbog. Or it might have been the other way, I don’t exactly recall now. The episode that I am about to relate began as a minor dispute between the Rightists and the Leftists over the use of water from a lake or reservoir. But soon it acquired a life of its own. The Rightists were more numerous, but apprehensive that the case of the Leftists might be stronger, or at least more effectively presented to the Government by their leader, the Shanbog. Naturally they went to their leader, the Patel, and expressed their concern, especially their fear that the Shanbog might have more influence in the taluk office because of his close association with its workers. </P>
      <P>The Patel dismissed their concerns. The Shanbog’s contacts, he pointed out, were only clerks in the taluk office. They neither heard cases nor made decisions; they only wrote and reported what the Amildar told them. Let the Shanbog consort with these menials, the Patel would cultivate the Amildar himself. He, after all, had the resources, and, as luck would have it, the Amildar was a young man attracted to music and dance. It is worth noting that some Patels were descendants of feudal chiefs of an earlier era. For that reason they were regarded as noblemen, while the Shanbog enjoyed no such distinction; he was simply a professional, a government servant. The fact that this Patel had never put his hand to any useful work had served to enhance his standing as an aristocrat. He decided now to cultivate the Amildar. </P>
      <P>The Patel – an accomplished impresario – went about his task in his usual thorough manner. Whenever he visited the taluk headquarters, he would make it a point to call on the Amildar accompanied by an impressive retinue carrying gifts of fruits and flowers for the Amildar and his family. The Amildar in those days was not merely a government official but a ruler, the representative of the Maharaja. When the Amildar paid his first official visit to the Patel’s village, he made sure that nothing was amiss. </P>
      <P>As the Amildar reached the village, the Patel was waiting for him at the entrance in his capacity as the village chief greeting the king’s representative. He bowed to the Amildar as befitting a king’s subject, and then greeted him as a friend. After a lavish lunch at which all the town notables – including the Shanbog – were present, the Patel took the Amildar to a music and dance program specially arranged for him. The seating was so arranged that all could see the Patel in intimate conversation with the Amildar, no doubt discussing the finer points of the performance. It was a triumph. </P>
      <P>This was only the beginning. The Patel never failed to invite the Amildar to the numerous performances hosted by him. The Amildar was young, a connoisseur of the performing arts, but he was no fool. He saw through the Patel’s game and decided not to get involved in village politics. He made it known that he would not meet the Patel or any of his party except on official business and that too only at an official place. This was a blow to the Patel’s plans; but more seriously for a man of his temperament, it was a blow to his prestige and standing as a leader. To gain control over the Amildar, the Patel hatched an elaborate and daring plan. </P>
      <P>To follow the Patel’s plan, and how he went about implementing it, it is necessary to have an idea of the conditions under which the Amildar used to camp in that town. It had no Traveler’s Bungalow. There was, however, an old mansion that used to be the residence of the hereditary Ursu chieftains of the place, before the state was reorganized and the estate was absorbed into the Maharaja’s kingdom. The Ursu descendants had moved out and settled in Mysore. Their ancestral mansion had fallen into disrepair, but it was still a fine old building with a spacious and well-ventilated upstairs portion. Through its large windows, one could hear the music being played for the morning and evening service at the nearby temple. There was a stairway from the side door that led to a broad landing area, from which one entered the upstairs room or the living area. (This landing is important, please remember). All in all, it was a pleasant place which visiting Amildars used as lodgings, partly out of a sense of obligation towards its aristocratic owners. </P>
      <P>The episode I am about to relate took place while the Amildar was visiting the place during the annual jatra. The village had a famous and historic temple which came under the administration of the Government. So the Amildar was there on official work. The jatra used to attract visitors from all the nearby taluks including Mysore, Nanjangud, Chamarajnagar, Yelandur, and others. The highlight of the jatra was a public performance given by the musicians and dancers of the place, many of whom had gained fame and fortune in all parts of South India. It was their annual homecoming. </P>
      <P>The Amildar was also in town, as just noted, on official duty to supervise security, supplies, and other arrangements. There was at the time, a celebrated violinist living in that village. His name was Malavalli Subbanna (I am not giving out the name of the place by naming him, for he lived at many other places.)<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>I think I have heard all the great violinists and musicians of South India, in their prime, over the past sixty years.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>In my </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>Also Malavalli is not in the Narsipur taluk where the narrated episode took place. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>That is, from about 1890 to 1950, the true Golden Age of Karnatak music. The only great musician of the era that he probably had not heard was Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer (1844-93). As an accomplished violinist himself, Rama Rao knew whereof he spoke. </P>
      <P>Celebrated Veena duo of Subbanna (left) and Seshanna (c. 1902). This Subbanna is not to be confused with the violinist Subbanna in the story. </P>
      <P>experience, the number of instrumental musicians who could equal Malavalli Subbanna in virtuosity, taste, and brilliance can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The immortal Veena Seshanna, and perhaps the violinists Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu and our own T. Chowdaiah could be compared to him. In Subbanna’s hands the violin became a living thing – with a truly magical tone – and a power of expression that could cast a spell on any audience. I still recall what the great Vasudevachar once said to me about him,<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>“Poor bastard! He never had any luck; a God-given talent, fingers that can bring out a golden sound, and a vagabond’s life.” </P>
      <P>In any event, at the jatra in question, the major program was a recital with Subbanna accompanying a well-known singer – one of the Patel’s favorites. It was said to be a brilliant concert. The Amildar complimented Subbanna. </P>
      <P>“Wonderful performance, Subbanna! You excelled yourself today. We should arrange for you to come and play at my place sometime. By the way, who is the singer? She is also very good.” </P>
      <P>“Whatever I play is the result of my Guru’s blessings and your patronage. Let me know when you want me to play, I’ll be at your </P>
      <P>Mysore Vasudevachar (1865-1961) was probably the greatest composer of Karnatak music of the twentieth century. </P>
      <P>service. The lady – she’s the Patel’s mistress. She’s from Mysore – studying with Veena Subbanna.” <SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Soon after the concert, in the coming days, the Amildar began to notice a distinct change in the public’s attitude towards him. People would avoid his eyes and put on a forced expression of blank innocence whenever his eyes fell on them. Gone was the customary deferential attitude that he was used to and expected as the Maharaja’s official. In its place he sensed a secretiveness mixed with amusement. Overnight the Amildar seemed to have turned into a comical figure. At the same time the Patel’s attentions seemed to increase, while his relationship with the Shanbog began to show signs of coolness. The normally cordial Shanbog now treated him with stiff formality bordering on indifference. </P>
      <P>The situation seemed to be getting worse by the day. One morning, as he was going around the town for his usual rounds, he happened to notice a bevy of young women – some of the musicians and dancers of the town – on the balcony of their local residence. As soon as his gaze fell on them, there were peals of laughter as the girls disappeared into the house. The Amildar was profoundly distressed by this open show of disrespect. How was he to uphold the dignity of his high office, as the king’s official, when the subjects regarded him like this? </P>
      <P>(“Why did he have to look at them?” one may ask. Well, why not? Was he supposed go on his village rounds blindfolded?) </P>
      <P>The Amildar was puzzled and depressed by all this, but also intrigued. He knew something must have happened to bring about this abrupt change and was curious to know what it was. How to get to the bottom of the affair? A few days later, the mystery unraveled on its own, revealing an extraordinary story. It began with the violinist’s visit to Narsipur in connection with the arrangements for the concert requested by the Amildar. Subbanna presented himself before the Amildar and asked, “You wanted me to play for you and your friends,” the violinist reminded. “When do you want it to be?” </P>
      <P>Veena Subbanna (1855-1938), known also as Bakshi Subbanna was a celebrated Veena player and a wealthy patron of musicians. Considered by many to be the peer of the more famous Veena Seshanna, he seldom performed in public. He also took on promising students whom he taught without charging a fee, and even supported a few needy students. </P>
      <P>The Amildar gave a date telling him that several of his friends from Mysore – all music lovers – would be present. </P>
      <P>“Do you want it to be a solo recital?” Subbanna asked. “If some visiting friends are going to be there, why not have a singer also?” </P>
      <P>Subbanna’s voice was not exactly fit for a public performance. So the Amildar asked, “Whom do you suggest?” </P>
      <P>“Who else my lord?” said Subbanna, assuming a tone of mock humility, “The same woman who entertained you at the jatra; for whom you showed such admiration and affection.” </P>
      <P>“Mind your language!” shouted the Amildar in indignation. “All I said was that she sang well. Just because I treat you with regard as a great artist don’t take liberties with me! Consider my position!” </P>
      <P>“I am sorry my lord,” the violinist replied. “I am only repeating what the people of the village are saying. The Patel is going around claiming that he has you in the palm of his hand – that you’ll do whatever he tells you. The Shanbog is saying that you have fallen into the Patel’s trap.” </P>
      <P>The Amildar was disturbed. He guessed that Subbanna must have come to him at the Shanbog’s prodding, using the recital as a pretext. On his own he wouldn’t have dared speaking to the Amildar in that fashion. </P>
      <P>“Having told me this much,” said the Amildar, “why don’t you tell me the whole story; don’t hold anything back.” </P>
      <P>“The story I hear is,” Subbanna continued, “that you had the woman visit you the night following the recital. The Patel sent her to you, they say. The temple manager escorted her to your lodgings. Having gotten wind of it, several men from the Shanbog’s party were hiding just outside the place and saw her go in.” </P>
      <P>“What nonsense!” the Amildar retorted. “I was sleeping in the upstairs room. My servants, my orderly, they were all downstairs near the entrance. Also, I always keep the bedroom door locked at night. She couldn’t have got into my room.” </P>
      <P>“Is the bedroom door such an impregnable barrier?” asked Subbanna, controlling himself with great difficulty. “Is it so hard to leave it unlocked when expecting such a visitor? Would any servant dare stop a woman visiting their master at night? Anyway, it is no business of mine. I’ll arrange the concert as you wish.” </P>
      <P>After Subbanna left, the Amildar sent for his personal orderly, one Dafedar Shaja Hussain, and asked him about the night. The poor fellow, scared out his wits, gave the following account: “The Patel came to me and said, ‘Hussain Sahib, tonight is a special night for your master. You should send away the whole staff and be alone on duty for the night. Someone dear to him will be coming to visit him. You should send her up without a word, without any noise.’ ” </P>
      <P>“It is an outrage!” shouted the Amildar. “Why didn’t you ask me?” </P>
      <P>“How could I?” Shaja Hussain pleaded. “Who could imagine the Patel to have such nerve; to lie to me about your lordship. I assumed it was your wish.” </P>
      <P>“Then what happened?” </P>
      <P>“At about eleven or so, a young woman came accompanied by the temple manager. I let her in. I saw her go up the stairs. Then I went back and sat in the front yard, waiting for her to come back. She came out about an hour later and left with the temple manager who was waiting for her at the temple across the street.” </P>
      <P>“Did you recognize her?” </P>
      <P>“I could see her face clearly in the night lantern by the door.” </P>
      <P>The Amildar sent for the temple manager Venkatappa on some pretext and asked him about the night. He said that the Patel had enlisted his help with the same story that he had given the orderly. </P>
      <P>The poor Amildar had become the unwitting hero in a romantic comedy. A mystery still remained. What was the woman doing? This was finally revealed by the woman herself following her break with the Patel, engineered by the rival faction. The Patel had told her to just go up the stairs and spend an hour or two sitting or sleeping in the landing leading to the Amildar’s bedroom, and then go back to her place. The Patel had promised her a diamond nose ring for her trouble. The poor Amildar was fast asleep in the bedroom, knowing nothing of the elaborate farce being enacted around him. </P>
      <P>The Shanbog’s party, now joined by the woman, rapidly spread the story. This discredited the Patel. There was a groundswell of sympathy for the Amildar mixed with some amusement. The Patel had lost his swagger, but he was not the kind to give up easily. He now floated a story claiming that the woman had gone to the Amildar on her own initiative. </P>
      <P>“When I learnt of this,” the Patel boasted, “I kicked that slut out. Am I a eunuch to be cuckolded by some Amildar?" </P>
      <P>The Amildar bided his time and took his revenge on the Patel. </P>
      <P>This story, still quite recent, had become part of the local folklore by the time I came to Narsipur as Amildar. Most of the participants were still around. I was not involved in anything so dramatic, but there was one instance where a similar plan was tried on me. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>There used to be a wealthy cloth merchant in Narsipur. (Let him remain anonymous.) One day, he paid me an unexpected visit and asked me with great diffidence, “Did you send Venkatappa [not the real name] to order some clothes?” </P>
      <P>I was surprised. </P>
      <P>“Of course not. Why would I send a man like him when I have my own servants? This sounds strange. Please tell me the whole thing. I want to get to the bottom of it.” </P>
      <P>He gave me the following account. </P>
      <P><SPAN>“Venkatappa came to my place and said, ‘I have to tell you something in secret.’ ‘What is it?’ I asked him. ‘It’s the Subedar’s wish,’ Venkatappa said. ‘He wants you to select a Dharmavaram sari in the 4045-rupee range and charge it to his account. He’ll send you the money after the first.’ I was surprised. ‘Where was the need to send you?’ I asked. ‘There are good reasons,’ he said. ‘Can’t you guess? He wants to give it to someone for the Gowri festival. What business is it of ours?’ I became suspicious. If he wanted it sent to “someone”, the Amildar would have sent me the money. Would he send such a seedy character and ask to put it on his account? I wondered. I kept my doubts to myself and told him, ‘I understand, but I am out of stock. Come back in a couple </SPAN>of days. But who is it for?’ He laughed. ‘Why bother? But be sure to have it by the Gowri festival.’ I then told him, ‘All right, come back in a few days. There are still six days before the festival. I should have the stock by then. If I don’t receive it by then I’ll buy it from some other merchant. But it is better if the person herself comes to my shop and selects the sari’. </P>
      <P>“ ‘No, absolutely not!’ Venkatappa said. ‘There is no way she can be seen coming to your shop. The Subedar will be furious.’ ‘What is the problem?’ I asked. ‘All the respectable ladies in town come and shop at my place. Why, even the Subedar’s wife comes here.’ ‘If it were the Subedar’s wife,’ Venkatappa said, ‘there would be no problem. You want to know who it is’ – and whispered the name of a prostitute in Moogur. ‘It is all right,’ I told him. ‘The stock will be at my home. She can come there and select in private. She doesn’t have to come to the shop.’” </P>
      <P>The merchant completed his story and looked at me expectantly, as if he still had some doubt that I might have sent Venkatappa to him. Otherwise, he would have told Venkatappa to bring a written order from me. </P>
      <P>This Venkatappa was a disreputable character – a go-between for illicit affairs and worse. His plan must have been to entangle me in a case by producing a receipt from the merchant for a sari purchased for the Moogur prostitute. That woman was known to belong to the party of a leader from that town. </P>
      <P>I thanked the merchant and told him to alert the police if Venkatappa or the woman should approach him on my behalf. Neither of them did. I myself punished Venkatappa suitably. During the investigation he admitted that he was acting on behalf of the leader from Moogur. </P>

      <H3>23 RIVER MEMORIES </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>The Kaveri and the Kabini and the adventures they spawned. Digression on Tippu Sultan. A drunken man and a miserly trader saved from drowning. A resourceful boatman saves the day. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>The two rivers, Kaveri and the Kabini, and their confluence at the sacred site of Tirumakudlu, serve as the backdrop to most of my memories of T. Narsipur. I have traveled extensively both in India and Europe, and have visited many famous and picturesque places. But for reasons that probably have to do with my youthful vigor and exuberance, nothing I have seen or known can compare with the beauty of Narsipur or the joyfulness of my experiences there. The Kaveri, with her sacred waters, is inseparably bound with these experiences. I had become her devotee long before I set my eyes upon her. By the time I knew English well enough to read and understand, I got hold of an English textbook called ‘Bradshaw’s V Reader’. </P>
      <P>How can I describe my joy? It opened a whole new world before me. I felt like Keats on reading Chapman’s Homer.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>I can still remember some of the lessons in it – Pope’s ‘Universal Prayer’, Wolfe’s ‘Burial of Sir John Moore’, Hood’s ‘Eugene Aram’, Lamb’s ‘Adventures of Ulysses’— but above all an essay called ‘Course of an Indian River’. I cannot now recall the name of its author but it left an indelible impression on my young mind. The Indian River was our own Kaveri. I devoured them all, especially the ‘Course of an Indian River’. </P>
      <P>In a wonderfully evocative essay, the author describes how the Great Lady, rising in Coorg, flows into Mysore, sanctifies everything in her path by turning Ramanathapuram, Hanasoge, Chunchan Katte, </P>
      <P>The reference is of course to Keats’s famous poem beginning “Oft have I traveled through the realms of gold …” </P>
      <P>Yedatore, Srirangapatnam, Sosale, Gargeshawari, Narsipur, Madapura, Mudukutore, and Talkad into places of pilgrimage. Then she leaps over the cataract of Shivanasamudram to enter the lowlands of Madras, bringing sanctity and prosperity to the province. </P>
      <P>He brought before my young eyes the grand history of places like Srirangapatnam and Shivasamudram – by describing the rise and fall of their kingdoms and rulers. Describing the last heroic days of Tippu Sultan he wrote <SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>“This powerful ruler met his end at the hands of an anonymous soldier. His glory and ambition burst like a bubble – remaining only to point a moral or adorn a tale.” </P>
      <P>As I remember, I saw the Kaveri for the first time in 1888, from the window of a railway compartment during my first train journey to Mysore. By then I had also read Philip Meadows Taylor’s Tippu Sultan. From Hirode<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>onwards, my journey was occupied in imagining that history. I saw in my imagination the fierce firangis attacking Srirangapatnam fort, with the brave warrior betrayed by the very men he had raised to high position. I saw him fall, fighting a hopeless battle, deserted by all but a handful of </P>
      <P>devoted soldiers. What a fall there was, my countrymen! </P>
      <P>In my boyhood days, whenever I came across an elderly Muslim, I used to imagine that his grandfather might have been a soldier or officer in Tippu’s army. I used to be a great admirer of Tippu in those days. He was born in Devanahalli, my own ancestral place. I had seen also the </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>This is translation from Rama Rao’s Kannada version. The English original, written in the 1880’s is no longer traceable. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>Now known as Pandavapura. At one time it was known also as French Rocks. </P>
      <P>housing complex where he was born.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>Tippu to me was the gentle Muslim, destroyed by the cannons of my hated enemies – the firangi. Today, many years later, my views about both Tippu and the firangi may have undergone some change, but have not entirely disappeared. ‘The thoughts of youth are long thoughts’. As a result, Tippu to me is still a hero, while the firangi, except for a handful of exceptions, are monsters. </P>
      <P>To return to the river geography, strictly speaking, Tirumakudlu or the junction—which literally means ‘tri-junction’ – is different from Narsipur though they are often regarded as one and the same.<SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>The Kabini flows between Narsipur and Tirumakudlu. The famous temple sits on the triangle formed by the two rivers. Today (1952) there are two bridges near T. Narsipur – one spanning the Kaveri and the other the Kabini. The Kabini Bridge leads to the road going south, leading to Moogur, Chamarajnagar, and Kollegal. The Kaveri Bridge carries the road going north and east – to Sosale, Malavalli, Bannur, Belakawadi, Shivanasamudra, and other places. These bridges did not exist during the days I am writing about. The rivers were not fordable five to six months in the year, so people had to be ferried across in boats and rafts. The contract rights for running the ferry service were awarded on the basis of bids at an auction. I found this was unsatisfactory and led to poor service: being poor, skilled watermen rarely had the money to make successful bids, while the men who had the capital were interested only in squeezing the maximum profit out of it. After taking over as Amildar I slightly modified the procedure. After checking previous records, I made the auction procedure little more than a formality by fixing the rates so that the boatmen received a decent income without making the service too expensive for the passengers. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>Devanahalli was the place where Tippu's father Hyder came to the attention of Nanjaraj Urs, the regent of the Mysore Mahararaja, by winning a shooting contest. Impressed by Hyder’s marksmanship, Nanjaraj appointed him a cavalry officer. That was the start of his meteoric career. Hyder, though he became effectively the ruler of Mysore, always claimed to be acting as the servant of the Maharaja. Tippu dispensed with this formality and styled himself Sultan. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>There are only two rivers, but a third, a supposedly invisible river is believed to add sanctity to the place by completing the trinity. </P>
      <P>“We have to spend all day in the water my lord,” the boatmen told me. “We need some concession in the price of liquor also to keep us going.” I found their request to be reasonable. I brought together the liquor contractors and the boatmen and arranged a mutually agreeable price. Of course, the liquor contractors had an interest, for they could not transport their goods without the ferry service during the high season. And the boatmen also could not do without liquor. So it was easy to get the parties to agree on reasonable terms. </P>
      <P>I have many memories relating to the rivers. Even though they were fordable for roughly half the year, flash floods due to sudden rains were always a threat even in the dry season. Then the river would rise without warning. I recall one such instance when I was crossing the Kaveri on horseback. As I was hurrying towards the bank, I saw a Sosale Kulawadi man standing in a puddle in the river, absolutely motionless. The water was beginning to rise on both sides of the river, but the man would not move either forward or backward. </P>
      <P>“Come this side or go back, don’t stand in the middle,” I called out to him. </P>
      <P>“I can’t my lord!” he shouted back. “I can’t see a thing.” </P>
      <P>“Why, are you blind?” I asked him. “Shouldn’t you have brought someone to go with you? You could lose your life.” </P>
      <P>“Not blind my lord, drunk. I can’t see a thing.” </P>
      <P>T. Narsipur river junction c. 1905 </P>
      <P>“You bastard! Just stay there, don’t move,” I told him. “I’ll send someone to get you.” </P>
      <P>After reaching shore, I sent him my trumpeter to fetch him and take him home. </P>
      <P>I recall another highly amusing incident, which still makes me laugh whenever I think of it. This was during the sacred season, when the five Shiva temples of Talkad – or pancha linga – are visited by pilgrims from all around. People coming from Kollegal have to cross the river near a place known as Malangi. On this occasion, water started rising, but the flow of pilgrims continued. It takes a little while to get the ferry service going.<SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>I had marked a safe path for crossing with a line of bamboo posts manned by policemen and other taluk workers. For some unknown reason, a ‘Shetty’ from Kollegal decided to take a different, unmarked route more or less parallel to the marked route but away from it. Perhaps he was worried that someone might ask him for a tip. The current seized him and dragged him into the water. As he was struggling to come out, waging a losing battle against the river, a police constable in full uniform, jumped in after him and dragged him ashore with great difficulty and at considerable risk to himself. </P>
      <P>Naturally a report was to be filed as part of the police record. The constable, the police inspector, and the Shetty came to my bungalow to report. The inspector spoke highly of the constable’s heroism and said, “Though hampered by his boots, belt and other paraphernalia of his police uniform, Constable Kempa, at great risk to himself saved this man’s life. But this ungrateful fellow has brought a complaint against Kempa because he asked for a small tip.” </P>
      <P>“You must hear my side also, my lord,” pleaded the Shetty. “He asked me for a tip of five rupees just because he pulled me out of the water. Is there no justice? Does he think that money grows on trees? Did I ask him to pull me out? He dragged my out on his own, without my permission. Sir, you are a judge. Please let everyone know what I am saying is fair.” </P>
      <P>These ferry boats, known as 'harigolu', are almost circular in shape. They are large shallow baskets made waterproof by covering them completely with buffalo hide. </P>
      <P>I could barely control my sense of outrage and also amusement. He no doubt thought he was being very clever. </P>
      <P>“Of course you are right! Don’t worry, I’ll teach him a lesson.” I told him. “Kempa, you fool! Why did you save this poor man from drowning without first asking his permission? Couldn’t you mind your own business? Take this man back into the river – and leave him exactly where you found him. Isn’t that a fair ruling, sir?” </P>
      <P>It might have been a fair ruling, but the trader from Kollegal didn’t seem to relish the idea of going back into the river. Nobody believed he wanted to go back anyway. A local merchant, also a Shetty, said, “Your conduct is a disgrace to our whole community. Will you pay up or not? I’ll pay this brave fellow if you can’t.” </P>
      <P>The Kollegal Shetty tearfully pulled out two rupees from his pocket and tried to pay his saviour. The policeman declined and said, “No sir, your soul is not worth that much. If you want to reward me according to your worth, just pay me three pice.” Here was a philosopher in police uniform! </P>
      <P>Everyone laughed. We took out a subscription and gave Kempa ten rupees as a gift acknowledging his bravery. It included three tear-soaked rupees from the trader from Kollegal. </P>
      <P>I have many other memories of the Kaveri. During my student days, I used to spend my holidays in Mirley where my dear uncle, Ananda Tirtha Rao, used to camp.<SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>He was then an assistant engineer in the Mysore service. The river is about two and a half miles from the town of Mirley. One morning I left home at six for a long brisk walk through the woods reaching the river around eight or half past eight. By then it had turned quite warm and I was sweating profusely from the exertion. The clear water, gushing between the rocks, with overhanging tree branches looked highly enticing. Egrets and other water birds nesting along the trees lining the banks were flying around making their characteristic noise adding greatly to the enchantment. </P>
      <P>In short, the scene before me was idyllic. I could not resist getting into the water. I had not brought my swimming trunks. Since no one Rama Rao’s mother was Ananda Tirtha Rao’s elder sister Brahmani Bai. Rama Rao later married Ananda Tirtha Rao’s daughter Kashija Bai. </P>
      <P>seemed to be around, I removed my clothes, left them on the bank with a rock atop and got into the water in the state that the Good Lord created me. In my exhilaration, I lost sense of time until the exertion of the morning walk and a couple of hours of swimming made me feel hungry. As I swam back to get my clothes I noticed that the riverside was no longer deserted. I saw a family of my acquaintance seated not far from where I had left my clothes. I waited for a while, but they seemed to be in no hurry to leave. Their lunch baskets suggested that they were there for the long haul. The sight of the lunch baskets only increased my appetite. It seemed they were waiting for me to come out of the water so they could enjoy the river. They had of course no way of knowing that I was in my natural state. It was simply the best spot for miles and they wanted to enjoy it. </P>
      <P>I kept wondering how on earth I was going to come out. Then a thought struck me. Like Archimedes in a similar situation, I too cried “Eureka”! And like him, I solved my problem without the help of teachers or assistants. </P>
      <P>“Shyama,” I called out a small boy who was with the family. “Could you please pick up those clothes on the bank, and leave them on the other side of the rocks by bushes over there?” </P>
      <P>He was a good boy. He didn’t giggle or try to be clever by telling me, “Why don’t you do it yourself.” He obediently followed my instructions, though there was a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. I came out of the water, put on my clothes and made myself scarce, without stopping to greet the family. Being a teenager, I was too embarrassed to see them. The story got home, suitably embellished. It was the cause of much merriment, and I too had the pleasure of knowing that I was the cause of their mirth. </P>
      <P>In these parts, so lavishly adorned with rivers, a non-swimmer is a depraved being. Not enjoying boat rides is a crime. At least thrice a week, I used to go to the rocks by the temple of Moolasthaneshwara and enjoy swimming in its deep waters. Like many others present there, I used to offer my sandhya-vandana and then worship at the Shiva temple. This brought me much praise from Smarthas and the Veerashaivas, who thought me an admirably devout soul with one only vice – smoking. The Shrivaishnavas on the other hand, were disdainful. </P>
      <P>“He is supposed to be a Madhva (Vaishnava)!” some of them sneered. “What sort of a Madhva is he? Worshipping at a Shiva temple, instead of the Vishnu temple of Gunja Narasimhaswamy? Why wear urdhva pundra? Let him wear sacred ash instead.” <SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>After I got wind of these remarks, I made it a point to go and visit the Gunja Narasimhaswamy temple also. This made everyone happy. Their offerings of appetizing prasad, if not the worship, seemed to increase my devotion. </P>
      <P>I grew to be very fond of the boatmen of the taluk. They were mostly poor but brave and hardworking. I can illustrate their courage and resourcefulness with a story. </P>
      <P>One afternoon, towards the end of the summer, a large number of women, children, and elderly people from Narsipur had gone to the Tirumakudlu temple on the banks of the Kabini. I do not remember the occasion; it was either a Hari Katha or some other religious function at the Agastyeshwara temple. Only the children who had gone to school and the men who had gone to work remained on the other bank. There </P>
      <P>Boatmen with harigolu— bamboo and cane basket boats waterproofed with buffalo skin. </P>
      <P>As a Madhva, Rama Rao was a Vaishnava, or a worshipper of Vishnu. Apparently he worshipped at a Shiva temple which Vaishnavas rarely do. Various other descriptions are sectarian markings. </P>
      <P>was soon a thunderstorm followed by a downpour. The result was a flash flood. The river turned into a raging torrent and rose by several feet in a matter of hours. It began to get dark, and the weather also turned stormy. Nearly half the population of Narsipur – mostly women, children and the elderly – was marooned on the far side of the river. As it was still the dry season, a couple of weeks before the rains were expected, the boats were in storage in different parts of the river. Some of them had probably been lost in the sudden flood. In any event, it would take several days to get them ready. </P>
      <P>This was the situation when several workers came to my office and reported the story with alarm. I had to find some way of dealing with the crisis; it was my responsibility as Amildar. The river was still rising with little possibility of the floods subsiding that evening. I sent for the chiefs of the boatmen from nearby places like Narsipur, Alagod, and others and asked them to help me. </P>
      <P>“What to do my lord, there are no boats,” said most of them. “If at least we had a few rafts, we could do something.” They gave a vivid description of the heroic feats they could perform if only they had boats and rafts. </P>
      <P>This was too much for Hotte Mada – Mada the Potbellied – an old boatman whose memory went back seven decades. “You worthless bastards!” he yelled at them, using swearwords that cast aspersions on their ancestry going back several generations. “Are you sons of Mother Ganga or measly cowards?” <SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>“Listen to this old man my lord!” he said turning to me. “In the days of the Great Maharaja, there was a similar mad flood.<SPAN><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN>I was then a small boy – only this high.” He indicated a height of about three feet. “My father, Meesey Manta Nayaka, was the chief of boatmen then.” (The name means Manta Nayaka of the Big Moustache) </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN>Ganga is the Holy Ganges, the Mother Goddess of people who live by the river — especially boatmen and fishermen. It is often applied to all rivers as an expression of reverence. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN>The ‘Great Maharaja’ was probably Krishna Raja Wodeyar III who died in 1868. The episode described above took place in 1908. </P>
      <P>“He was a real man,” the old man continued. “He ruled three wives. He drank three seers of liquor. He was not like today’s effeminate softies, sitting around and crying ‘What to do?’ He got hold of all the empty cans and drums and bamboo in town and built rafts to ferry people across the river. Why don’t we do the same?” </P>
      <P>The rest of the boatmen agreed that it was a good idea. Their enthusiasm doubled when I told them that they could have all the liquor they could handle after finishing the job. I then sent word to the local construction depot and got hold of all the rope, bamboo, and empty kerosene cans that we could find. We then soldered the empty cans so that they would float, and my taluk workers and the boatmen somehow managed to put together four rafts. I also had brought four or five kerosene lanterns from local traders and other lamps from the town temples. I sent the rafts across the river to Tirumakudlu. I myself went over to the other bank riding on the first raft. </P>
      <P>Crossing the river in the dark, windy night, on these makeshift rafts could be quite hazardous. Unless absolutely essential, there was no need expose the women and children to the risk of the crossing. I made arrangements for food, lodgings, and warm blankets for the women and children forced to spend the night in Tirumakudlu. Those men – mostly old men – willing to travel on the rafts were ferried across. Mainly it was to let people on the other side of the river know that their family members were safe and looked after. The rafts had to make several trips carrying food for them. Of course, the boatmen did not go to sleep until their thirst was fully-quenched. <SPAN><Sup>11 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>How can I describe in words the grandeur of the place when the rivers were in full spate? Following a west-to-east course, the Kabini joins the Kaveri, then flowing in a north-to-south direction. The two rivers, becoming one at the holy site of Tirumakudlu, sanctify the towns of Mudukutore and Talakad by endowing them with a share of the blessings of the sacred confluence. The Kaveri then flows along a broad expanse, lined on either side by fertile villages and prosperous towns filled with lush green fields and tall palms and trees as far as the eye can </P>
      <P>It should be noted that Tirumakudlu was then a temple town with just a few families living there. It had no facilities for feeding and lodging a large number of visitors. </P>
      <P>see. I may lack the literary skills to describe the beauty of the place, but I think I have enjoyed her blessings as much as anyone I know. </P>
      <P>Some boatmen told me that M.G. Krishnaswamy Rao, who had served before me as Amildar of Narsipur, once travelled the distance to Mudukutore by boat following the course of the flood. In those days he was something of a legend in these parts. I knew him by fame before I came to know him as a friend. I was determined to equal or better his feat. Ignoring the advice of friends and elders, I dashed to Mudukutore when the river was in spate, covering the distance of about ten miles in less than two hours by taking advantage of the current.<SPAN><Sup>12 </Sup></SPAN>How can I describe my feeling of exhilaration? Although I was not known to be free with my subordinates, I relaxed and spent the two hours joking with the Shirastedar, the police Jamedar and others who seemed or pretended to be scared. I told them how on one occasion, Rajaji and I, while students in Madras, had gone some five or six miles into the sea with some fishermen. Learning that the Shekadar knew some devotional songs, I persuaded him to sing a few. The poor soul delivered them in a voice shaking with cold, and possibly fear, which I praised. After touching Mudukutore, I thanked the boatmen and gave each a tip of two rupees. (Two rupees those days was a lot of money when people raised families on one rupee a day. It could buy ten seers of rice, and more importantly, enough country liquor to fill a bathtub) </P>
      <P>I went to the Mallikarjuna temple that night and offered service; I had great difficulty in getting the village priest to correctly pronounce the royal blessing.<SPAN><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN>I spent the night at the small inspection lodge at Mudukutore. I also sent a note to my family so they knew that I had completed the trip safely. </P>
      <P>After this experience, whenever possible, my family and I used to make our trips to Mudukutore by boat. It was quicker and also far more enjoyable than traveling by road. Although the novelty of the boat trip </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>12 </Sup></SPAN>This is now called ‘white water rafting’, but the sport was not common in those days. Also, people those days did not use life jackets. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN>These village priests, being uneducated had difficulty pronouncing the royal blessing, which was in flowery Sanskrit. It also shows that the amildar, as the representative of the Maharaja, was entitled to the royal blessing in temples. </P>
      <P>soon wore off, the enjoyment never did. Our trips were not entirely without incident. I recall two in particular. On the first occasion, when our boat was about four or five miles from Narsipur, there was a sudden thunderstorm. The river became choppy and the waves began to toss the boat around. The boatmen began to lose control of the boat. Even the boatmen became concerned – let alone the poor passengers. I told the boatmen to somehow take the boat to the near shore to a village called Musukina-koppa. They did so with great difficulty and skill. In that downpour, we reached the village safely and went to the house of the Hegde, requesting him to put us up for the night. </P>
      <P>The Hegde proved to be a large-hearted man. He lived in a magnificent new mansion with a covered courtyard in the middle. He treated us to a sumptuous meal and gave me his own bedroom for the night. It was a huge, lavishly furnished room, with life size nude pictures of foreign women from Germany. It had also an unusual bed made of costly rosewood, with brass fittings and reinforcements. Apparently no expense had been spared in making it commodious and luxurious. A singular feature was the three-foot high mirror that surrounded it like a wall. Anyone sleeping in that bed could enjoy watching himself in the mirror all around. With our host the Hegde, his physical appearance was not as beautiful as his heart. His was a burly, nearly black body overgrown with hair all over to such a degree that the word hirsute is inadequate to describe it. I wondered if he took delight in watching it in all four directions. Or perhaps, his partner who shared the bed with him was an object that he never tired watching, and he wanted to enhance the pleasure fourfold. </P>
      <P>We enjoyed the Hegde’s hospitality for the night and continued our journey to Mudukutore in the morning. In my experience, the Hegde’s of this region are simple and generous but proud people. They are not as sophisticated or worldly as the Vokkaligas, nor arrogant like the Veerashaivas. </P>
      <P>I recall another incident a couple of years earlier when I was still Amildar of Yedatore. I was on foot at the time, and lost my way in the blowing rain near a place called Hulle-Bore-Kaval. After wandering around in the dark for a long time, I found a light where a small group of Kurubas were camped for the night. Approaching them, I asked them if anyone could show me the way to Hosa-Agrahara, which was my destination. One of them agreed, asking me to wait a while so he could finish his supper. He folded his shoulder blanket, which he placed on the ground, offering it to me as a seat. He then brought me a pot of boiling hot sheep’s milk. It had a peculiar pungent odor that put me off. I could not drink it. When he saw this, his face fell. I then smelt some garlic as someone seemed to be preparing some rasam. I asked him if I could have some of it, which I could mix with the milk to mask its odor. With extreme hesitation he told me that it was also prepared with the same milk. He brought me some in a cup prepared with a leaf. It was excellent – or at least seemed so because I was so hungry. </P>
      <P>I have many more memories associated with rivers going back to those days, but these should give an idea of the delights. </P>

      <P>
        <strong>The SDO discourses on his theories about philosophy and science. Memories of a former Diwan. Meeting an astrologer of amazing talent. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Within a few days of taking charge as Amildar of T. Narsipur, I was graced by the visit of the subdivision officer (SDO) on the occasion of the ‘huzur jamabandi’. Having camped in Santemara-Halli for jamabandi in Chamarajnagar taluk, he came to Narsipur via Moogur. The Amildar of Chamarajnagar was Venkataramana Shrauti, a personal friend of mine. I attended the banquet at Santemara-Halli given in the SDO’s honor at the conclusion of the jamabandi. The SDO was Vaidya Natha Iyer (V.N. Iyer) whom we have already met in Najanagud. I did not know him particularly well at the time. I have previously related my misadventure in connection with his dinner invitation which he had forgotten. </P>
      <P>I asked my friend Shrauti about how to deal with the SDO. To me he seemed a strange character – almost a throwback to an earlier century, and nearly twice my age. I wanted to make sure that the work went smoothly and also I wouldn’t say or do anything that might hurt the old man’s feelings. Shrauti smiled and said, “He won’t cause you any trouble. He knows you’re the deputy commissioner’s (DC) favorite Amildar. He is also slightly afraid of you – what with your reputation for a fiery temper. Still he is a strange man – almost like a child in many ways. He will say thoughtless things without meaning any harm; without the slightest notion that it might hurt others. I don’t have to spell it out. You’ll see for yourself soon enough.” </P>
      <P>I did see soon enough, at the reception itself that had been organized with utmost care by Shrauti. It was a grand occasion with a photographer and a sumptuous banquet for lunch. It was close to two in the afternoon by the time we sat down for lunch. There were frequent servings of coffee and small eats, so most of us did not notice the delay. </P>
      <P>But the SDO, V.N. Iyer, was very orthodox and strict in his observances and never put anything in his mouth without going through an elaborate prayer and ritual. So he was extremely hungry by the time we sat down for lunch. Like most elderly men, he had also reached the end of his patience because of the hunger. (Now in my old age, I know this to be natural. I did not know it at the time.) </P>
      <P>Shrauti led the SDO Sahib to the head of the banquet, to the seat prepared for him. “I must apologize,” said Shrauti, “it is a bit late.” </P>
      <P>“So it has finally dawned you that it’s late,” the Sahib retorted. “Your watch had stopped perhaps.” </P>
      <P>I did not expect such behavior from someone for whom the banquet had been arranged. One hears of such behavior from the legendary Sage Durvasa, and from some critics who habitually receive free food at charitable places and who feel they have a right to criticize everything. But I had never before seen anything like this from a person of V.N. Iyer’s position. </P>
      <P>This was only the beginning. We sat down for lunch. I have already noted that the SDO was very strict in observing religious rites. Food had to be served in a particular order. Rice and ghee had to be served first and the rest only after he had said his pranahuti. The poor fellows serving lunch – some local Brahmin cooks – knew nothing of all this. They simply followed the local practice of serving rice followed by a helping of dal. The Sahib was furious. He got up and went after the serving boy as though he wanted to hit him. </P>
      <P>“You bloody bastard!” the SDO Sahib shouted. “Don’t you know better than to serve dal before pranahuti. After I have said pranahuti – serve dal or serve amdehya, for all I care.” </P>
      <P>Literally amedhya means food unfit for offering to the Gods; it can also mean excreta. The SDO obviously meant it in the latter sense. It never occurred to him that the rest of the world might not be as knowledgeable about these niceties. I felt sorry for my friend Shrauti as he went on to remove the old leaf on which the offending serving had been made and had a new leaf laid. This time, the food was served strictly according to the SDO’s instructions. </P>
      <P>From all this, the reader can see that SDO V.N. Iyer was not exactly an engaging personality. He began my taluk jamabandi at Moogur, and made his way through the taluk stopping at some of the important towns. He was not a diligent official. A few veteran clerks practically ran his office. With their help, the jamabandi ran smoothly, as did the usual formalities relating to supplies, food, and the evening durbar. But I found it advisable to caution his clerks who seemed to be a law unto themselves. </P>
      <P>“I am not going to tolerate any harassment of my staff in the villages or at any level,” I told them. “If I hear of any attempts by you to extract bribes from citizens, you will be tried in my court. I am not going to spy on you or come in the way of the usual hospitality that is your due as government servants. The main thing is I don’t want to hear any complaints.” </P>
      <P>1</P>
      <P>They took my warning seriously and I had no trouble with them. This was not the only problem I had to deal with. The Sahib could not ride. He was unused to walking also. His age and health made it hard for him cover long distances on foot. As a result, most of his rounds had to be in ox-carts. I was not used to riding in them. So I followed him on horseback. No matter where he stayed, most of the morning was taken up with his religious activities, leaving him little time for official work. By the time he was finished it would be time for lunch. </P>
      <P>“The Sahib cannot eat anything cooked in oil,” his assistant had told the supply officer. “It gives him a bad cold. All food must be prepared with pure butter and ghee. If he comes down with cold, he knows immediately that oil has been used.” </P>
      <P>Of course, none of us complained about the arrangement. As a result, even those like me who lacked the Sahib’s special sensitivity benefited from the arrangement. </P>
      <P>I have mentioned previously that SDO V.N. Iyer owed his position in the Government to his family connection, as the brother-in-law of the famous Diwan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer. He told me several interesting things about the great man’s early life. I can still recall a few. It appears that as a </P>
      <P>It is clear that Rama Rao saw himself as the ruler and protector of his taluk. This no doubt accounted for the love and devotion of the people that he was able to command. </P>
      <P>boy, Seshadri Iyer was not active like a normal child. He used to stop playing with other children and stand all by himself, totally lost to the world. His father believed Seshadri to be the dullest of his children. He was concerned about the boy, believing that his other children would somehow be able to take care of themselves. Once a famous astrologer from Malabar (Kerala) visited them for lunch and read the palms of all the children. He told the father that Seshadri </P>
      <P>would rise to high position and attain great fame. </P>
      <P>Thefatherlaughedat thisand then sighed.“Heisaverygoodboy,”hetold thepalmist,“butadullard.Atleast,letyourblessingsbringhimahappylife.” </P>
      <P>V.N. Iyer also told me that Seshadri Iyer had great faith in astrology. He had his detailed horoscope drawn, with all the predictions, and stored it in a safe. Apparently he had only once shown it to V.N. Iyer. Seshadri Iyer firmly believed that his wife’s devotion to God and her saintly qualities were responsible for his own eminence. He held her in utmost respect, bordering on reverence.<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>On the basis of his horoscope, the Diwan believed that he would be blessed with fame and happiness as long as his wife lived, and unhappiness would visit him after her death. His horoscope had apparently predicted the year of his death also. He was shattered by his wife’s death. When his wife died he told his intimates, “All light has gone out of my life.” He had deep faith in Vedanta. Sir William Hunter once said of Seshadri Iyer: “He has devoted his intellect to Herbert Spencer, and his heart to Parabrahman.” <SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>There is an interesting story about his devotion to his wife. When Diwan Seshadri Iyer built a luxurious house in Bangalore – now known as the Seshadri House – his wife refused to move into it because it had no place where she could perform her daily worship and honour Brahmins. In deference to her wishes, the Diwan built a small temple on the premises. It still exists. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>‘Parabrahman’ = Lord of the other world or God. </P>
      <P>Seshadri Iyer had great reverence for Sri Sri Narasimha Bharati, then Pontiff of the Sringeri Mutt. I know this from first hand evidence. When as Diwan he might have been excused for thinking that he had the world at his feet, he sent a humble letter to the Pontiff through his representative Srikantha Shastri. My friend Dasappa of Belavadi showed me a copy of it. The Diwan, in his letter, after describing the successful completion of several of his programs, appealed to the Pontiff (through Srikantha Shastri): </P>
      <P>“I have not the slightest doubt that the success of these schemes is due entirely to the blessings of the Master. I still have my doubts and fears. Whom else can I appeal to for guidance? Success, victory, wealth, fortune – these are transient. The blessing that I seek from my Lord is totally different. I long only to serve at His feet, to be released from the world and granted true knowledge. He should show compassion and bless me with these. I may be undeserving, but He is generous.” </P>
      <P>This is the same blessing that Narada in the Chandogya Upanishad begs from his master Sanatkumara. This is life’s highest aspiration. </P>
      <P>Seshadri Iyer wanted to be a sanyasi, I was told. I vaguely remember hearing that he received holy orders as a sanyasi on his deathbed, but I am not sure. During his final illness, V.N. Iyer tried to comfort him by saying that he seemed to be getting better. </P>
      <P>“Nonsense! What getting better?” Seshadri Iyer retorted. “Don’t you see that the time predicted in my horoscope is at hand?” </P>
      <P>V.N. Iyer bowed his head in sad assent. </P>
      <P>I also know that he wanted to clear his conscience by rectifying an injustice. When Sehadri Iyer was Diwan, Yelandur Jagirdar P.N. Krishna Murthy had the strongest claim to succeed him. But it was an open secret that Seshadri Iyer wanted to promote one of his own favorites brought from Madras by pushing Krishna Murthy aside. Finally, the Resident’s office provided the Diwan with evidence that some of his trusted courtiers were scheming behind his back to undermine him. Knowledge of this, or more likely his own sense of justice, made him change his mind and recommend Krishna Murthy as Diwan. On the day before his death, he invited Krishna Murthy to his bedside and informed him that he had been recommended to succeed him as Diwan. Seshadri Iyer told him, “I have no personal animosity towards you. May God give you health and happiness so you may serve your king and your country. May you emulate your great ancestors and achieve fame by serving your people. Before I go, I just want you to know that I have no ill will towards you.” </P>
      <P>Krishna Murthy, a gentle, simple-hearted person was moved to tears by this appeal.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The SDO Sahib – V.N. Iyer – was interested in Vedantic philosophy, but it was an interest marred by narrowness. He was of the view that there was a good deal in common between Vedanta, as he understood it and modern science – meaning ‘modern’ for those days (c. 1905). He was always ready and willing to be the teacher of this viewpoint to anyone willing to be taught. Someone who knows both science and Vedanta thoroughly may find similarities between the two – I am in no position to say. One who is ignorant of both will have no difficulty in connecting the two – especially when armed with authority. The SDO’s subordinates listened to his discourses on the subject with utmost attention and respect. As I had studied science I used to keep my mouth shut. Or I would find some official reason to excuse myself. </P>
      <P>SDO V.N. Iyer was a follower of the Advaita or Non-dual school of philosophy. They are called Smarthas. As a Madhva Brahmin I am a follower of the Dvaita school expounded by Acharya Madhva (1238 - 1317) in the thirteenth century. In some ways it stands in opposition to Advaita. V.N. Iyer regarded Madhvas like me as fallen Smarthas. </P>
      <P>5</P>
      <P>According to him Srivaishnavas are not Brahmins at all. They are totally beyond the pale and beyond redemption. </P>
      <P>Taking pity on my fallen state which he believed would exclude me from heaven, he tried to guide me along the true path. But I was not too concerned about salvation or heaven. Nor did I have much interest in the hair-splitting differences between dual and non-dual philosophies. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>Rama Rao told Rajaram that Diwan Krishna Murthy confirmed the story for him. This was noted in an earlier chapter, describing Rama Rao’s last meeting with Krishna Murthy. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>The Srivaishnava sect, also professing non-dualism, was founded by Ramanuja in the 12th century. They are commonly known as Iyengars. The Madhava sect was founded by Madvacharya in the 13th century. </P>
      <P>All I knew was that I was a Madhva by birth, as were my ancestors and saw no reason to change. Several times I dropped hints that I was not interested in being shown the true path. It didn’t work. Finally, I told him the following story. </P>
      <P>My father’s elder brother Vyasacharya (1819 -1904) was a renowned scholar. He had gained fame at various centers of learning like Tirupati through his expositions of the various schools of philosophy. He was extremely fond of me. When I was a small boy, he once asked me, “What are you learning at school, Ramu?” </P>
      <P>“English,” I proudly replied. </P>
      <P>According to my uncle, our conversation went on like this. </P>
      <P>“What is English for God?” </P>
      <P>“God” </P>
      <P>“Father?” “Papa.” </P>
      <P>“Uncle?” “Don’t know.” </P>
      <P>“Clever?” “Don’t know.” </P>
      <P>“Fool?” </P>
      <P>“I know the word for fool,” he recalled me as saying. “They say Vyasa Kaka (Uncle).” </P>
      <P>Although I had forgotten this exchange long ago, my uncle used to remember it with great amusement almost every time I went to see him. When I was older, he made me read and explain the Bible to him, since he did not know English. He then exclaimed: “What a great man Jesus was! His Sermon on the Mount – how it resembles what Lord Krishna told Arjuna.” </P>
      <P>Many years later, after I had completed my law studies, I went to see him at his home in Devanahalli.<SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>My uncle was with his students, in the midst of a teaching session. As soon as he saw me, he came and embraced me and went back to his teaching. I was full of pride with my recent achievement, and waited impatiently until he finished his teaching session and came back to me. Then I asked him, “Vyasa Uncle, </P>
      <P>This would be 1902, the year Rama Rao passed his law exam. </P>
      <P>you must have studied various schools of philosophy – the Dvaita, the Advaita and the Vishistadvaita.” </P>
      <P>“I have,” my uncle replied, “to the best of my ability.” </P>
      <P>“How about Christian and Muslim scriptures – have you studied them too?” </P>
      <P>“You translated and explained part of the Bible for me some years back. Recently, I have had a chance to look through the Kannada Bible published in Mangalore. I have not studied the Muslim Holy Book.” </P>
      <P>“Having studied all these, which one do you think is really true?” I asked him, hoping to trap and defeat him, or at least impress him with my lawyer’s cleverness. (May God forgive me!) </P>
      <P>He was quiet for a while. He then gave me a long look – a look as guileless as a child’s – and said, “Which one is true you ask? How can I know? Only the Lord Srihari knows the truth. I can only tell you what I believe in. What I believe in is what I learnt from my revered father and teacher – the teachings of our supreme Vaishnava sage – Sri Madhvacharya. It has given me both peace and happiness. I ask for nothing more.” <SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>I felt very humble. I expressed my profound respect by prostrating before him. He comforted me with affection and humour. </P>
      <P>“That is my belief,” I told the SDO V.N. Iyer, who was trying to show me the true path. Indeed it expresses my belief. The God that I believe in is full of compassion and forgiveness. I can appeal to him as a son to a father, and as a friend to another. I find it impossible to accept that such a God would be so vindictive as to make weak and fallible humans fall into eternal hell. </P>
      <P>V.N. Iyer had great faith in astrology. I have already related his story about Seshadri Iyer and his horoscope. He would never start anything without checking for auspicious time and signs. I found it highly amusing. “Why should planets be so interested in what you and I do?” I once asked him in jest. </P>
      <P>Vyasacharya’s teacher was his father (Rama Rao’s grandfather) Ramacharya. They were Madhvas, or followers of Madhvacharya who lived 1238 -1317. Madhvas are known also as Vaishnavas. Vaishnava simply means devotee of Vishnu and includes many more sects. </P>
      <P>“Rain drenches you and the sun can burn you,” he retorted. “Can you say that Indra (the Rain God) and the Sun are ill-disposed towards you because you are such a big man?” </P>
      <P>I didn’t know how to respond and let it go at that. </P>
      <P>Do I believe in astrology? What can I say? As to the question whether it is a science that allows one to predict future events on the basis of the calculation of planetary positions – I have not studied it sufficiently to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. My own view is that there is not enough evidence to call it a science. At the same time I would not want to dismiss it as nothing but nonsense perpetrated by frauds. From the beginning of history, many men and women of great learning, experience, and wisdom in all countries have believed in astrology. Many still do. I am not prepared to say they are all fools and only I have the good sense to disbelieve it. But every one of us has the right, even the duty, to examine the evidence and arrive at conclusions based on one’s own experience and judgment. So I can only relate what I have learnt from my experience without passing judgment on the rest of humanity. </P>
      <P>In my experience, I have known predictions made by astrologers to go wrong – not merely wrong, but ludicrously wrong. But I have also known a few instances when they have been astonishingly accurate. I will next relate one of them from my own experience. </P>
      <P>It is best to begin the story when I was assistant secretary while Sir </P>
      <P>M. Vishweshwaraya was Diwan.<SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>I was then attached to a department known as the Economic Conference, in charge of the agriculture </P>
      <P>Sir MV as he was commonly known is regarded as a visionary, but Rama Rao did not hold him in especially high regard. He lived to be over a hundred, which, Rama Rao joked, was his major achievement. His words to Rajaram, describing Vishweshwaraya: “He is a ripe old man.” In the 1930s he and Rama Rao came into conflict over his extravagant spending when Visweshwaraya had been brought in as consultant. The photo above shows Vishweshwaraya as a young man. </P>
      <P>section. It was an environment in which bureaucratic exercises like showmanship, report writing, and voluminous correspondence carried more weight than productive work. As I was spending my time engaged in this shadow boxing, I became interested in a truly worthwhile project – one that could enrich the state and also bring great benefits to the people. This was silk production – or sericulture. If properly cultivated, it had the potential for providing employment for lakhs of our people, and also bring to the state an annual revenue exceeding a crore of rupees. </P>
      <P>Sericulture in Mysore was then in a sorry state. If neglected, it was in danger of becoming extinct within a few years. Recognizing this, the Government had invited several foreign ‘experts’ to remedy the situation. It did not take me long to recognize that these experts knew nothing about the problem, and their ‘advice’ was making it only worse. I decided that nobody had bothered to properly study the problem. I undertook a tour of the various silk producing centers in the state and made a detailed evaluation of the situation. In particular, I examined the past history when it was a flourishing industry, and the changes that had brought about its decline. I also examined the reasons why people were giving up silk farming and production. After a few months I felt I understood the problem and also saw what needed to be done to bring it back to health. </P>
      <P>I prepared a detailed plan and submitted it to the Government through my superiors. Some of my colleagues laughed at it. “Here comes the know-all genius to cure the incurable,” said one. “This fellow must have learnt silk rearing in law school,” said another. “These days, everybody has to have a gimmick,” said one more, “silk making is Rama Rao’s.” I paid them back with compound interest. None of them had any authority to either help me or hurt me. </P>
      <P>Fortunately, my old friend Kantha Raje Urs was the chairman of the Economic Conference. I spent of a good deal of time explaining what I had done. He listened to me with an open mind and concluded there was merit in what I had recommended. He felt that I should be given the opportunity to put my plan into effect and recommended that an entirely new department be created for the purpose. He put the full weight of his authority behind my plan and got the Government to sanction the Department of Sericulture along the lines I had recommended. The Government approved it and I was invited to be its chief. (It helped that Kantha Raje Urs succeeded Vishveshwaraya as Diwan.) </P>
      <P>I accepted my new position with misgivings, with a sense of duty. I felt I could discharge the responsibility successfully, and it would result in excellent employment opportunities for lakhs of our people. It would bring prosperity to thousands of families, and a beautiful industry of the state that was on the verge of extinction would again flourish. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to make a real contribution. But it also meant some sacrifice on my part. It meant giving up any hopes of being promoted to posts like the deputy commissioner (DC) or secretary to the Government. To govern a district as DC had been a lifelong dream with me. It was not easy to give up all this. In any event, I reconciled myself to the possibility that I would serve out my tenure in the Government in this one department, receiving only the promotions and positions created for it. </P>
      <P>I served in Department of Sericulture for twelve years, devoting all my energy and intelligence to building up the silk industry in the state. I can say that I achieved the goals that I had set for the Department. I had no dreams beyond retiring as Director of Sericulture. As it turned out later, this was not to be the end of my career, but the beginning of a new one. I had not the faintest idea that I would serve in different positions or that I would travel abroad and participate in national and international events. </P>
      <P>This was the situation when my friend Venkat Krishnaiah of Sakleshpur and I went to Hassan on some work. Nanaswamy Rao was then DC of Hassan district. While we were engaged in conversation at his house, a young man – an engineering student I think he was – stopped by. Nanaswamy Rao introduced him to me and said, “You see, he is a very gifted astrologer. Show him your horoscope. I don’t know if it is God’s gift or what, but every single thing he says comes true.” </P>
      <P>Venkat Krishnaiah had complete faith in astrology. He has studied it and has now acquired some proficiency in the subject. I was then a total non-believer. It must have showed on my face. I told the visitor that I did not have my horoscope with me. </P>
      <P>“Doesn’t matter,” the young man said. “Let me take a look at your hand.” </P>
      <P>I held out my hand with a laugh, which might have sounded slightly mocking. </P>
      <P>He looked at my hand intently for a few minutes and said, “If you can relate a few incidents of importance from your life, I can tell you if your hand matches them.” </P>
      <P>This only made me more suspicious. </P>
      <P>“Why don’t you tell me what you find in my hand,” I replied with a laugh. “So I can tell you if they are correct.” </P>
      <P>He took up the challenge. He took me aside and told me several things about my life, which I thought no one else knew. He told me the year in which I joined the service, the exact number of my brothers and sisters and the number of children I had with perfect accuracy. I was totally taken aback. He then took my date and time of birth according to the English (Gregorian) calendar and cast my horoscope. </P>
      <P>“I’ll read the chart and send you a summary of my predictions tomorrow,” he told me. I received the following summary the next day. </P>
      <P>“You will go to the Secretariat. Your horoscope shows a sea voyage – visiting foreign countries. You will participate in a major political event. You will become the head of a Government Department in such and such a year, and retire in such and such year.<SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN>After retirement, you will continue to make important contributions and be awarded a title by the Maharaja.” </P>
      <P>None of these seemed remotely possible at the time; they had not even crossed my mind. But every one of them came true. The young man I believe works now in the Public Works Department (in 1952). I cannot recall his name. </P>
      <P>Rama Rao continued in service even after reaching the mandatory retirement age in 1932, at the Government’s request. There was of course no way of knowing it when these predictions were made, sometime around 1920. He declined a second extension even though the Government offered to promote him. Later he received the title Rajasevapraskta from the Maharaja. </P>
      <P>Another incident comes to mind. My friend N.S. Subba Rao was a firm believer in astrology. In 1930, when our Diwan Sir Mirza Ismail was to lead a delegation to the First Round Table Conference in London, it was expected that he would be taking two staff members with him. It was known that one of them would be Nyamati Madhava Rao, then Chief Secretary (later Diwan). It was not known who the second member might be. I was then Development Secretary. A few days earlier, the Diwan asked me if I was willing to accompany him to England for the Conference (1930). I happily agreed. But then, Sir Brijendranath Seal, the famous Vice Chancellor of Mysore University, strongly recommended that N.S. Subba Rao should be the second member. Seal’s recommendation carried considerable weight and it looked as though my chances had dimmed somewhat. This was the situation when Subba Rao and I were having a friendly chat at the club one evening. He had already been to England on a previous occasion. </P>
      <P>“According to my horoscope,” Subba Rao said half in jest, “I am to make a second trip to England this year. Poor you – you have no chance.” </P>
      <P>His astrologer was one Srinivas Iyengar, if I remember right. He worked in the Revenue Commissioner’s office. I found his faith in astrology amusing. </P>
      <P>“My astrologer has also predicted that I’ll go to England this year,” I joked. “He is also a formidable character. It’s my astrologer against yours. Let us see who will come out on top.” </P>
      <P>The end result? Both of us went to England that year. What to make of it? </P>
      <P>All this is a digression – taking us from 1908 to 1930. But it is in the nature of a book of reminiscences to make such leaps in space and time. </P>
      <P>Before going on this digression on astrology, I was speaking of the SDO V.N. Iyer and his visit to my taluk for the jamabandi. He was somewhat clueless when it came to revenue matters, but he had that not so common quality known as commonsense. The jamabandi proceeded smoothly. His manner of speaking with the villagers and farmers struck me as a little rough, partly because of his Tamil accented Kannada. It also had a pungent edge that is common among people coming from the lowlands to the south. It is not easy to describe but an example might help. </P>
      <P>We went to visit a village known as Turuganoor. A downpour the previous night had caused the open drains to overflow and flood parts of the main street with sewage. Many village notables, including the Patel, had come to see the visiting SDO Sahib. The Sahib made some routine inquiries and then turned to the Patel. </P>
      <P>“Hello Patel!” the Sahib said, “have you kept your village clean.” </P>
      <P>“As much as possible my lord,” the Patel replied, “you must see for yourself.” </P>
      <P>As we were going through the village the Sahib could see and smell the overflowing sewage. </P>
      <P>“I say Patel,” the SDO asked, “do they call this clean in your language?” </P>
      <P>“What to do my lord? Learning of your visit, the Rain God blessed us with this rain after a long dry spell.” </P>
      <P>The Patel was not without wit, but the SDO was not to be outdone. He turned to me and said, “This is what I call real devotion. Please put it on record, Subedar Sahib that learning of my visit to his village, the Patel had arranged for a downpour of smelly, sewage-mixed, rain.” </P>
      <P>Within a year of my taking charge as Amildar of Narsipur, V.N. Iyer had to leave the service under something of a cloud. Following his retirement, there was some sort of a plot by a few officials to discredit him by floating charges. As soon as I learnt of it, I secretly investigated the charges. Finding most of them to be baseless, I did not allow the episode to go any further. </P>

      <H3>25 A PLAGUE EPIDEMIC </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Unusual challenges of dealing with a plague epidemic. Using a medium to convince the tribals. Bringing Baba Saheb around. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>I had to deal with a cholera epidemic when I was Amildar in charge of Yedatore taluk. The year I came to T. Narsipur as Amildar (1907), I had to deal with a plague epidemic that struck several towns and villages across the taluk. In my experience there are only two ways of effectively containing the epidemic – immunization by vaccination and camping outside the infected town until the epidemic passes. Remedies like disinfecting the houses and killing as many rats as possible are worthwhile goals, but their effectiveness is limited. One can never be sure that all the infection sources – fleas that carry the infection – have been totally eliminated. Hunting rats in their own habitat is of course never easy. They are highly elusive. It was for this reason that the Moghul Emperor Aurangazeb used to call the Maratha warrior Shivaji the ‘mountain rat’. </P>
      <P>I found it extraordinarily difficult to persuade village families to leave their homes for a temporary camp for the duration of the epidemic. The attachment of a farmer to his home and hearth is something that has to be seen to be believed. It is also not easy to set up camps to house large populations. I even incurred some displeasure in the Government with my persistent demands for building shelters for the displaced. I did manage to transport hundreds of cartloads of bamboo, sheets, and other materials from neighboring taluks like Chamarajnagar and Gundalpet and distributed them to the villages that I felt needed them the most. I marked out areas in government land and forest areas and gave them permits to erect temporary shelters. I got together the leaders of various communities and asked them to co-operate in setting up and running these camps. This worked well in the smaller villages where personal relationships are on the whole cordial. It didn’t work so well in large villages and towns where there tend to be factions and rivalries. I had to devise other ways of getting things done. When they worked, I was happy and the object of much praise. In hindsight not all of my devices may seem admirable, but I had little choice. Here is what I did in one of the villages. </P>
      <P>The village in question was Alagodahalli near Narsipur. Most of its inhabitants were boatmen and household workers. They were devotees of the Grama Devata, the village deity known as Alagodamma. Its priest was one Hotte Mada Nayaka.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>A particularly important person in their belief system was Mada Nayaka’s daughter Kempa Nanjamma. The villagers believed her to be the medium through which their Goddess Alagodamma spoke and advised them on important matters. Whenever faced with an important decision, they went to this woman for advice – just as the ancient Greeks went to the priestess of Delphi who was the medium for the Oracle. They followed the advice or the order issued by Kempa Nanjamma, which they accepted as the word of their Goddess. </P>
      <P>Rats began falling in the houses and barns of Adagolahalli. I advised the town folk to leave the village and camp outside, and also get inoculated. Normally they obeyed my instructions, but this time they had to answer to a higher authority – their Goddess Alagodamma. </P>
      <P>“We have built our houses and huts around her temple,” they pleaded. “How can we leave without her permission?” </P>
      <P>I saw the futility of my direct approach. I told them, “You are right. You cannot leave your Goddess without asking her first. Ask her and do as she orders.” </P>
      <P>All the village elders were to offer worship the following Friday and appeal to their Goddess through Kempa Nanjamma. They invited me also to attend the service and offer my prayers. On Thursday, the day before the important occasion, I learnt that the priest Mada Nayaka and his daughter Kempa Nanjamma were in Narsipur. I asked them to come over and see me about the service. After inquiring about the </P>
      <P>It is not clear if it was same Mada who took the lead in building the rafts for the marooned women and children during a flash flood described in an earlier chapter. </P>
      <P>arrangements and the time at which I had to be present, I turned to Kempa Nanjamma and frankly told her, “Your Goddess is like the mother of your people. She always has their interest and welfare in her heart. If it is true that Goddess Alagodamma comes on you and speaks through you, she will surely tell her people to do what I have been telling them – get inoculated and camp outside the village until the epidemic passes. She will certainly not tell them to stay in the village and die like rats. When ordinary people like you and I have this knowledge and concern for our people, will the Goddess not have much more?” </P>
      <P>Kempa Nanjamma was a clever woman. She just said, “How can I know what Goddess will tell me, my lord? I speak for her, she doesn’t speak for me. But as you say, doesn’t the Goddess know what is good for her people? Let the villagers continue their prayers, feasts, and ‘harike’, and do as she tells them.” </P>
      <P>“What harike?” I asked. </P>
      <P>“If the Goddess tells them to go to camp, they must hold their prayers and festival in the camp. And they must tell her that they will build a small hut as a temple for her in the camp and continue their festivals and offerings.” </P>
      <P>Well, the following day I went to the Alagodahalli temple and sat with the devotees. We were close to five hundred in attendance, made up of locals as well as a significant number from nearby places. There was a tumultuous noise from the tom-toms, horns, trumpets, and conch-shells – all being played together – that engulfed the temple yard and soon reached the sky. The devotees began their offerings also of fruits, flowers, animals, lights, fires, and everything one could think of. When there was such an outpouring of devotion, would the Lord fail to hear their appeal? – I wondered. </P>
      <P>A thick pall of smoke from several fires and oil lamps covered the entrance to the temple like a screen. Shortly, I saw the figure of Kempa Nanjamma appear in the semi-darkness of the temple in the smoke. She was seated on the floor with a heap of kumkum in front of her. She seemed to be in a trance, eyes half-closed, her head moving slowly in a circular orbit. Her forehead was covered with kumkum, her hair wet and tied in a knot. She was wearing a sari soaked in haridra and water, which gave it a saffron hue. It was an impressive sight. </P>
      <P>As soon as I entered, someone called out, “Subedar is here, Mother!” </P>
      <P>She turned her face towards me. She was sweating profusely. The vermilion powder mixed with sweat pouring down her face gave the appearance of blood. Her eyes were half-closed, with a strange expression that one sometimes sees in a lunatic fit. She seemed to be in a state of some kind of a possession, brought on by the surroundings and the extraordinary nature of the event. I was concerned that she might let loose some gibberish as the message of the Goddess. I was relieved to hear her speak distinctly. </P>
      <P>“My children!” she spoke in an impressive voice. “You called me and I am here. What do you want from me, my lord?” </P>
      <P>I was concerned. The villagers habitually used the term ‘my lord’ as a term of respect in addressing me, but this was the Goddess Alagodamma speaking!<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>I decided I had to do something before someone’s suspicions could be aroused. I folded my hands and addressed her with utmost respect. </P>
      <P>“Great Mother! I may be a lord to these people. But with you – I am just a servant following your commands. Please do not make me look foolish and arrogant before your devotees by addressing me as ‘my lord’. We devotees are assembled before you as supplicants. What crimes have we committed to deserve this plague? What will make it go away? Why are you so angry with us? What should we do so you will favor us again with your blessings?” </P>
      <P>I have already said that Kempa Nanjamma was a very clever woman. The Goddess spoke through her as follows, “I called you ‘my lord’ to test your mind – your humility. You people of my village! You have ignored me and my temple for many days. You have closed its door and stopped being my devotees. So I brought this plague to teach you a lesson. My children! Have you learnt your lesson? At least now, worship your Goddess. Leave town, and camp in the grove by the side of the Moogur </P>
      <P>The actual Kannada word is ‘buddhi’ or ‘buddhiyore’, which has no English equivalent. The nearest is ‘wise master’, which we feel is too awkward. ‘My lord’ conveys the same idea of respect combined with intimacy. Swami was also a common form which means lord. </P>
      <P>road. And take the medicine that the Subedar gives you. Don’t go against this!” </P>
      <P>After pronouncing this message Kempa Nanjamma collapsed into a swoon. The Goddess had left her. I saluted the Goddess in the temple and came out. After this everything went smoothly. People not only of Alagodahalli, but also from all the surrounding villages came to know of the proceedings and followed the advice of the Goddess. They set up camps outside their villages and moved out. Many of them also got themselves inoculated against the plague. </P>
      <P>Apparently, my approach though unconventional, was not unique. Necessity being the mother of invention, the human mind resorts to similar methods in similar situations. A couple of years ago, my friend Sir </P>
      <P>T. Vijaya Raghavachar told me of an episode where he, as Diwan of Cochin, had to use methods similar to mine to get the co-operation of the people. He did not at the time know of my experience. </P>
      <P>This brings me to another experience I had during the same plague epidemic. The village in question was Gargeshwari. In actual count, Kurubas and other Hindus were in the majority, but in terms of wealth and influence it was really a Muslim village – at least in those days. The chief of the Labbeys was one Baba Sahib who ruled his community like a feudal lord. These Labbeys, who had come to three villages in the area – Gargeshwari, Narsipur and Kirugaval – as traders had acquired considerable wealth and had become one of the dominant communities. They had the reputation of being capable of any crime and many were involved in smuggling. Because of this and the fact that they were a united lot in dealing with persons outside their community, people and families from respectable communities tended to avoid dealing with them. This was not a fear born out of cowardice, but rooted more in a sense of civilized behavior – that one could not get down to their level of unscrupulous conduct. </P>
      <P>The Gargeshwari Muslims and the Hindus differed on one other point: due to arrogance growing out of their newly acquired wealth, the Labbeys of Gargeshwari tended to look down on government officials, nearly all of whom were Hindus. Whenever an official visited Gargeshwari, the Hindus of the village treated them with respect and cordiality due to a Maharaja’s official, and offered co-operation. The Labbeys, on the other hand feigned indifference. They would stay in their shops or take positions in front of their houses, watching the official’s visit as some sort of entertainment show. If an official was sent to see one of them, they would appear but make it clear that they saw it as imposition and an unwarranted intrusion on their lives. I saw their whole behavior as a calculated gesture of defiance. As one who always liked to work with the people on the basis of friendship and co-operation, I found their attitude offensive. Still I felt it was beneath me to use my authority to bring them around. But during the plague epidemic, I had no choice but use my authority. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>The plague struck the Gargeshwari village. The Hindu population took my advice and moved to camps outside the village. But the Labbeys refused to budge from their infected homes. Legally I had no authority to move them by force. Many of them died, but they would still not budge.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>I took the health officer from Mysore to Gargeshwari to get the people inoculated. Most of the Hindus came forward to meet us. To give them courage, I had myself inoculated first, right before their eyes. (My recollection is that I had myself vaccinated in small doses several times to facilitate this performance.) After this, the Hindus in Gargeshwari came in and got inoculated. </P>
      <P>I then sent for the Labbey families to come and get inoculated. Knowing that Muslim women would not come out, I offered to have lady doctors brought in from Mysore to treat them. No one came. Several Labbey youths were standing at a distance, treating the whole thing as a joke. This made me angry. It was not just a question of their insolent, insular behavior. An epidemic is like a fire and affects the whole area; it cannot be treated as a local or personal problem. It has to be treated as a community health problem. I sent for their chief Baba Sahib. He sent word that he was busy and would come and see me as soon he finished his work. But he slipped out of sight and never came. We waited a long while but there was no word of him. I decided to go and see him. </P>
      <P>This was not due to arrogance alone. Muslim women in those days were kept in seclusion – a practice known as purdah. It still prevails in many Muslim communities in India and elsewhere. This created problems if they had to live in a camp with other communities. </P>
      <P>When I went to Baba Sahib’s place I found his house locked. To those wandering about in the area, our frustration seemed like a huge joke. I felt that our failure might encourage even loyal subjects to think that they were unnecessarily subjected to a painful treatment, which they could avoid by defying me. This greatly annoyed me. Here was my problem: I had no legal authority to force anyone to leave home for the camp or get inoculated. But as I noted before, the health and safety of the whole village was endangered by their behavior. So I went around the house to see if there was any violation that might allow me to bring a charge against him. </P>
      <P>I saw that the sanitation around his place was wretched – far worse than what used to prevail in those days of relatively primitive sanitation. The place was filthy and foul-smelling. The sewage from the house was running in an open drain and emptying into a large puddle or a small pool. Some hens and cocks, a few ducks and crows, were playing about the pool. This was a violation of the health code. Of course, Baba Sahib was hardly alone in violating it, but it gave me the grounds for filing a charge against him. I sent for the sanitary inspector and told him, “Can’t you see this filthy mess? Don’t you know your duty? Isn’t it your job to take note of such violations of the health code and bring charges against the violators?” </P>
      <P>I left the scene. The sanitary inspector immediately collected some witnesses and filed a charge of health code violation against Baba Sahib. The charge, filed in my court, stated that Baba Sahib was guilty of endangering the health of the whole village by the poor sanitation of his house. As soon as he heard the news, Baba Sahib came near my house to see me. My servants refused to admit him stating that they had orders to refuse admission to anyone who had not been inoculated against the plague. They also informed him that he could see me in my office if he had any business. I was busy when he came. I made him wait until I finished my work and then asked him in. He spoke to me with the respect due to a Maharaja’s official, but in a tone of suppressed anger. </P>
      <P>“The sanitary inspector has filed a charge of code violation against me,” he complained. “Am I the only one in this village guilty of it?” </P>
      <P>“I don’t have to answer your question,” I replied. “If there is a charge against you, it will be heard in my court in due course. I am busy now. Is that all you have?” </P>
      <P>He stood waiting expectantly but I returned to the files on my table. He left. </P>
      <P>His case was heard in my court. I held the hearings at different places in the taluk – Bannur one day, Talkad next, Moogur on the third, and so on. This forced the old man to travel across the taluk, to nearly all the major villages. He tried very hard to have the case transferred to a different court but failed. After a few days of this, one of Baba Sahib’s relatives from Narsipur came to see me. After a few preliminary pleasantries, he requested me to settle the case against Baba Sahib amicably. He agreed to have the necessary repairs done to ensure that the drainage around his house would pose no sanitation problems for the village. </P>
      <P>“Let him do as you say, then I’ll see.” </P>
      <P>It was legally permissible to settle the case if the charged party complied with the health regulations. I held a hearing in Gargeshwari itself and the sanitary inspector inspected and approved the repaired work. I also got a written apology from the leaders of the Labbey community and closed the case. Following this, they accepted my advice and got inoculated and also moved to temporary camps outside the village. After this episode, the Labbeys also behaved with me like every other community in the taluk. </P>
      <P>Although I was successful in imposing my will – and the Government’s authority – on a recalcitrant community, I was not particularly proud of the fact that I had to push my authority to the limit, to the point of harassing an old man. I feel there was also an element of vindictiveness also on my part. So I tried my best to forget the whole episode and largely succeeded. Many years later the story came back to me under amusing circumstances. This was years after my retirement, when I was chatting in the club with some of my friends. In our group was a retired senior officer who had spent the early part of his career as Amildar of T. Narsipur. This was some years after I had served there. He regaled the audience with one of his experiences as Amildar. </P>
      <P>“T. Narsipur you see is a very difficult taluk,” he told us as he began his story. “The Amildar there has to be really tough. When I was serving as Amildar of Narsipur, there was a plague epidemic in the taluk. In those days there used to be a powerful and wealthy leader – a Labbey. He cared for no one, not even the deputy commissioner. We sent for him to undergo plague inoculation…” and so on. He went on with the story, a carbon copy of my own experience with Baba Sahib. He added just one detail; that towards the end of the case he slapped Baba Sahib. </P>
      <P>“Well done sir,” I applauded him. “But why did you have to hit the poor fellow – an old and infirm man?” </P>
      <P>“Just to make my point sir,” he reassured me. “I didn’t strike him hard, just barely touched him.” </P>
      <P>Returning to the plague, it was particularly virulent in the torageri of Moogur. Most of the villagers got inoculated and also left for the camps. But one elderly couple could not. They were taking care of their two orphaned grandchildren. When I took the doctor to their home, both the children were down with the plague with bubo in their armpits. The doctor told me that there was little point in inoculating them as they had already come in contact with the infection. Sending them to camp also posed a hazard to the health of the people. The doctor suggested that they just be allowed to stay where they were. </P>
      <P>The grandparents were listening to our conversation intently. They begged us to give some medicine for the children. We gave them rough ground wheat, a can of powdered milk, and a rupee or so to take care of the children. The elderly couple insisted that we give the children some medicine. The doctor told me in English that there was no medicine to give to the two children as their condition had deteriorated beyond any medical help. So I told the elderly couple, “Make the children drink hot milk mixed with ground wheat. Take the bark of the neem tree there and some sprouting leaves from the bil tree and grind them into a paste and apply it as poultice to the bubo.” </P>
      <P>I said some more encouraging words and left. I forgot all about it. Then, some months later, long after the plague had disappeared, I had to be in Moogur again. The elderly couple and their two grandchildren visited me and prostrated before me. They offered me a coconut and a large bunch of plantains. These were the children we had given up as dead! </P>
      <P>“These children you saved, they are your children,” the grandmother told me. “We did as you told us. Applying ground neem bark and sprouting bil leaves and a diet of milk and ground wheat soup. The bubo burst like a boil and the children recovered. Many people in the village took the bark and leaves from our house. A lot of them were helped but we lost the trees.” </P>
      <P>What to make of it? The two trees had given their lives for a worthy cause. God is great. With his grace, a humble plant can become the nectar of immortality. </P>

      <H3>26 TEMPLES AND COURTS </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Temple politics and court cases. Advocate Ramanna’s unusual theory about a robbery. His need for police protection. Travel conditions a hundred years ago. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>It would be entirely appropriate to call Narsipur taluk the abode of temples. Its long history, from the ancient Gangas to the Wodeyar rulers, saw a rich heritage of temple building activity. The presence of so many temples combined with the great natural beauty of the surroundings is bound to inspire spiritual feelings in any sensitive soul. Major temples are located in Muttatti, Gargeshwari, Tirumakudlu, and Mudukutore. These adorn the banks of the Kaveri like jewels on a necklace – like the pendant of the celebrated temples of Talkad. I have already commented on the importance of the Tripura Sundaramma Temple of Moogur.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>The Hoysala temple of Somanathpur is world renowned like the temples of Belur and Halebid, the Taj Mahal, and the Pyramids – as a wonder of architecture and artistry. </P>
      <P>In addition to these major temples, every picturesque corner on the banks of the Kaveri and the Kabini, every forest and grove, and every hilltop, is adorned with a temple or a humble structure that serves as a place of worship. Every one of them has its own special service, a feast, or a festival. I have great affection and respect for our simple people who devoutly visit these places, serving to keep our tradition alive. There are times when I wonder if the education and the experience that I acquired have not harmed me by taking me away from the simple faith of my ancestors. Is it ‘progress’ to impoverish the soul by tempting people with the lure of money and modern education? When I saw simple people in temples, praying to their favorite deity, their voices choked with emotion, it made me wonder about their closeness to God, </P>
      <P>A puzzling statement; there is no earlier mention of this famous temple by name. It could be the temple connected with the misadventure of the Amildar described in the chapter 'A Comedy of Design'. </P>
      <P>and how real God seemed to them. The sight of such devotion used to bring me comfort also – like the sound of devotional music from a distance or a breath of cool fresh air. I will describe a scene that I saw and which should give an idea of the beliefs and conduct of these people. </P>
      <P>Sri Mallikarjuna Swami Temple of Mudukotore sits on a small hill by the Kaveri. In addition to Lord Shiva (Mallikarjuna), the temple houses Goddess Bhramarambika, often called ‘the Mother’. The Mother is believed to be compassionate but fierce. Her devotees are expected to be pure in body and spirit; otherwise retribution is swift. This is a firm belief among the devotees. (This is what convinced me that the licentious conduct of the devotees at Mudukutore described by Abbe Dubois in his book could only be a projection of his own state of mind and not the truth. )<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>As I just observed, I saw a vivid example of the depth of the devotees’ faith. When I was visiting the temple, I saw a woman, the mother of a sick child – of what caste or community, I don’t know – place the child before the idol of the Mother and pour out her grief in a voice choked with emotion: </P>
      <P>“O Mother! You have eyes and ears! Can’t you see the grief burning in my stomach? Can’t you see me and my husband, struggling day and night, washing our hands in tears? Can’t you hear our prayers, O Mother? I have already buried four children. Please leave this one small light burning!” </P>
      <P>She must have heard a reassuring message from the Mother. She went back with a hopeful smile and a happy expression on her face. </P>
      <P>I can recall another episode, an amusing one, bearing testimony to their devotion and faith. At Talkad, there used to be an American missionary; Reverend Patient was his name as I recall. The Lord somehow inspired him to save these ignorant people from eternal darkness— at the Mudukutore jatra of all places. It is after all, at such places that the Devil appearing as a heathen God, casts his evil spell and destroys their soul. Filled with compassion for these damned souls, the </P>
      <P>A brilliant insight! The conduct described by Du Bois is totally incompatible with the belief of the devotees as a fierce goddess. </P>
      <P>good Reverend took his saving mission to Mudukutore. </P>
      <P>I was in Mudukotere on official duty in connection with security and other arrangements for the jatra. One of the Reverend’s associates – a disciple or his cook or someone – came running to me and said excitedly that the people had surrounded his master and about to beat him up. At first I was amused, that “the sun that was to drive away darkness from the souls of heathens was about to be eclipsed.” My amusement soon gave rise to concern; it would bode ill for everyone if a foreign missionary, a white man, were to be seriously hurt by some ignorant people. I hurried to the place of his sermon to try to defuse the situation before it could turn ugly. </P>
      <P>There he was, standing on a small eminence, gesticulating wildly; delivering his sermon in an atrocious accent, as though expecting his gestures to compensate for his poor language. The effort had made him flushed and he was also sweating profusely but otherwise seemed quite unharmed. Still, he seemed relieved to see me. The people around him also became quiet. After making sure the visitor was unhurt, I asked the people what the problem was. An elderly man – his face and forehead covered with sacred ash, with a garland of rudrakshi beads around his neck – came forward and spoke to me in a tone showing some annoyance. </P>
      <P>“Listen to this insolent foreign bastard sir,” he complained. “We came to him thinking that he might have something useful to tell us, or some jewelry or medicines to sell. Instead he began abusing us, addressing us as ‘You sinners!’ What sins have we committed? Are we thieves or robbers? Did we rob his house for him to abuse us like this?” </P>
      <P>Some others around him shouted and nodded in assent. I then asked the Reverend to give me his account. </P>
      <P>“As a result of Adam’s original sin,” he replied, “the entire human family has sinned. As they are human beings, they are also sinners. I began explaining to them that the only way for them to cleanse themselves of their sins is to follow Jesus. Without faith in Jesus they will remain sinners, and there can be no salvation for them. They will burn in hell forever. As I was telling them this they began to raise a commotion.” </P>
      <P>“You are a brave man.” I told him. “Your soul must now be content. </P>
      <P>You are also very fortunate to come out of this unhurt. They know nothing of your scripture or of your ancestor called Adam and his sin. They had no idea of sin until you brought it here. These men and women are sincere devotees on a pilgrimage. Having bathed in the sacred river and offered worship in their favorite temple, they feel blessed. When you call such people ‘sinners’ it is natural for them to get upset. For them, ‘sinner’ is a word of abuse – not used in polite conversation. I have a humble suggestion for you. Put an end to your attempts at saving their souls. Please go somewhere else and try.” </P>
      <P>He took my advice and left. </P>
      <P>Based on my experience hearing court cases, the cases in Narsipur were more numerous, but less complicated than those in Yedatore. But a good number of them used to have lawyers from Mysore and Najangud arguing them. As a result, a large part of my time in the courts was spent hearing criminal cases. At times these cases could turn out to be amusing like the following one. </P>
      <P>The case involved a complaint about one party abusing another in extremely foul language; enough to provoke a fight. Both the parties were Veerashaivas. The abuse was certainly highly insulting. Its gist was that the abuser was familiar with the female members of the victim’s family for several generations. This would have led to a fight under normal circumstances. What stopped it was the initiative of one of the witnesses – one Mastan Sahib. He showered abuse on both parties in words comparable to those that had led to the dispute in the first place, and told them to come to their senses and make peace. This had some effect. </P>
      <P>When I asked the disputants, they agreed. I was disgusted. </P>
      <P>“Have you fellows no shame?” I asked them in disgust. “When your own people abused you and your family, you went to court. But when this stranger, a Muslim, came and abused both of you in the same fashion, you agreed to settle your dispute. Are you happy now? Go settle between yourselves.” </P>
      <P>“Yes my lord!” said Mastan Sahib. “That is exactly what I told them. Why do you fellows, brothers of the same community, want to fight it in court? Settle it among yourselves. But these fools don’t want to listen to an old man like me. They have come to your court – wasting your time and their money.” </P>
      <P>I called the Patel of the village who was in attendance, and had them settle their dispute out of court. </P>
      <P>In another case from my memory, two robbers had broken into a house by making a small hole in the side wall. A dog grabbed hold of the leg of one of the men as he was trying to leave and left a clear wound. The other was a burly fellow, whose shoulders and arms were bruised as he was escaping through the hole. These and other telltale marks allowed the police to arrest these men. They then led the police to the place where they had hidden the stolen goods. They were identified as the goods missing from the house. This allowed the police to build a strong case for prosecution. </P>
      <P>During the hearing, I found that these men seemed to have the support of some wealthy parties. They had brought well-known criminal lawyer D.A. Ramanna from Mysore.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>Because the case for the defense was weak, Ramanna came up with the argument that the police had framed the robbery charge against his innocent clients. </P>
      <P>“Your honor!” Ramanna thundered in his closing argument, “the police themselves patronize some thieves and robbers. These characters steal here and there and furnish things for the police to supplement their low income. To conceal this, the police once in a while plant some of the stolen goods on innocent people and frame them. This has the additional benefit of bringing certificates, promotions, and medals for the police. This way they get to kill two birds – getting additional income and gaining recognition. This is such a case. Everyone </P>
      <P>– the Patel, the police constables, all the way to the police inspector – is involved in this conspiracy. Your honor! My clients are totally innocent.” </P>
      <P>This was his theory. I was thankful that he didn’t include me as one of the culprits. He spoke in his usual loud and verbose manner, flooding the court with a torrent of words. From the intensity with which he argued, putting his heart and soul into this outlandish theory, I guessed </P>
      <P>We have met the lawyer Ramanna before in Chapter 2. He was the one who insisted that Kantha Raje Urs should record what the witness did not know, and also argued with another judge about Mahommed of Ghazni. </P>
      <P>that he had just been paid his fee. And from the vehemence of his argument I guessed it to be a large one. </P>
      <P>After the hearing was over, Ramanna asked me, “Sir I have a personal request to make. I have to return to Mysore tonight itself by bullock cart. The night police patrol goes up to Agasara Halli or Megalapur every night. That road is not safe after nightfall. Please instruct the police on patrol to accompany my vehicle." </P>
      <P>The police inspector had been listening to Ramanna’s argument, seething with indignation. As soon as Ramanna requested the police escort, the inspector got up and blurted out, “Why would you want our protection, sir? You just said that the police are thieves and we patronize thieves and robbers. Your clients are honorable, innocent men. They are the ones to protect you.” Next, turning to me, the inspector said, “My lord, I have no objection to releasing his clients on their lawyer’s cognizance so they can protect him on his night journey.” </P>
      <P>I could not hold my laughter. “What do you say Mr. Ramanna?” I asked the lawyer. “Don’t you think it is a sporting offer? The police will release your clients for your protection, if you are ready to sign the bond on their behalf. Are you agreeable to it?” </P>
      <P>Ramanna joined in the general laughter. “This is a court where you argue cases,” said Ramanna, “the other is a highway where you have to save your head.” </P>
      <P>There were no obstacles to providing police protection to travelers that night. </P>
      <P>In those days, travel from Mysore to Narsipur was by bullock carts. Buses were still some twenty years in the future. The Mysore road was known as the home of robbers. The Varuna ridge and the depression immediately after it were notorious as the site of many robberies. For this reason, carts never traveled alone at night; they always moved in convoys of twenty or thirty vehicles. Travelers were especially fearful during the marriage season and the season after harvest. The carts used to cross the rivers at Narsipur and join the carts coming from other routes at Gargeshwari and proceed to Mysore only when their numbers were large enough to form a convoy. They would usually begin the journey around ten at night and reach the Mysore tollgate at dawn. </P>
      <P>After I took over as Amildar, I heard that there was a robbery at the Varuna ridge in Mysore taluk. Some time later I received report of a shower of stones and rocks on carts traveling within my taluk boundary. This was several days before the wedding season and the harvest season. It made me furious. </P>
      <P>I felt that such organized robberies could not take place without the connivance of at least some of the cart drivers. I saw also a pattern in the robberies. First, there would be rumors to the effect that a group of robbers was operating in the area; this would soon be followed by a hit on those carts carrying marriage parties and those returning from paddy sales in the Mysore markets immediately after harvest. The reason, of course, was these passengers would be carrying jewelry and cash. This required inside knowledge. And individuals in the best position to provide this intelligence were cart drivers themselves. It might be pointed out that the drivers hired to run the service were mostly Labbeys from Gargeshwari and surroundings areas; many of them had a reputation of being involved in criminal activities. </P>
      <P>To deal with this, I worked with the officials of neighboring Mysore taluk and set up procedures for the registration of carts and cart drivers. The policeman on duty at the checkpoint of the tollgate would make a note of the names of the men driving the bullock carts to and from Mysore and get their signatures along with a record of the time at which the convoy left the checkpoint. This was usually at ten o’clock at night. Any cart arriving later would not be allowed to leave; it would have to stop for the night and leave only in the morning. I also got the deputy commissioner’s (DC) sanction for a special beat police to accompany each convoy – one from Mysore, the other from Narsipur. The two policemen would meet at midpoint, sign a register and return to the starting post with the convoy and report to the inspector. </P>
      <P>The system worked extremely well and virtually eliminated robberies on the highway. To check the efficacy of the system, the Amildar of Mysore and I travelled with the convoys a few times without giving any prior warning. </P>
      <P>I broke my own rule once and nearly came to grief. My wife and I had been to Mysore and I decided to return the same night. When I reached the checkpoint at the tollgate, there were only about four or five carts – too small to travel as a convoy. But I told the policeman on duty that I was the chief law enforcement officer and would take the carts with me and take care of their security. I also showed him that I had my revolver and my repeater rifle with me. I signed the register and left. Whether I was in a hurry to reach Narsipur or if it was just bravado on my part, I cannot now recall. </P>
      <P>It was a mistake. We had traveled about seven or eight miles when the driver whispered to me that he could see some men moving about behind the trees by the roadside. He was afraid they might try to rob us. I took out my loaded rifle and cocked it, ready to fire. Then a loud voice from behind the trees called out, “Stop the cart!” </P>
      <P>I told the driver to unyoke the oxen and get under the cart and stay still. The carts following us came up and joined us, forming a single mass. I rested the rifle on the cross rope in the front portion of the cart and waited. I expected that the robbers would approach us from the front. My rifle was loaded with five cartridges in the magazine (and my revolver had six). I was not planning to shoot to kill, but if anyone approached, my intention was to shoot him in the leg and catch him and through him catch the whole gang. </P>
      <P>This did not require much courage on my part, only a cool head. Most robbers and thieves are cowards by temperament. I recall a similar incident from my childhood when we were traveling from Mysore to Shimoga.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>My father had been posted to Shimoga and the whole family had to travel the one hundred and seventy odd miles by bullock cart as there was no was no train to Shimoga in those days. As we approached Arsikere – it was called Kalla Arasikere (Thieves’ Arsikere) in those days – it was well into the night. We heard some shouting accompanied by stones thrown at us. My father jumped out of the cart with a loaded double-barreled shotgun in hand. Telling the driver and the passengers not worry, my father fired a shot in the direction of the noise. As soon as they heard the gun report, the robbers disappeared into the night. </P>
      <P>We have met the lawyer Ramanna before in Chapter 2. He was the one who insisted that Kantha Raje Urs should record what the witness did not know, and also argued with another judge about Mahommed of Ghazni. </P>
      <P>Returning to my trip from Mysore to Narispur, the same thing happened. From our behavior they must have sensed that I was prepared for them – or it might be a trap to catch them. No one came. We waited for the convoy from Mysore and covered the rest of the distance to Mysore in their company. </P>

      <H3>27 THE GODMAN COMETH </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>A holy man claiming unusual powers arrives in Narsipur. A demonstration of making gold. A pious police officer fails to convert a thief. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>Were our grandfathers more gullible than we are, or were charlatans and impostors of yore more crafty than those plying their trade today? This is not easy to answer, but I will next relate my encounter with one who was more than ordinarily skilled. </P>
      <P>One day I heard that a holy man of extraordinary powers, capable of turning base metals into gold, had arrived in Narsipur. He was said to be living in solitude, frequenting places like abandoned old temples, solitary woods by the river, and other places far away from human habitation. He was reputed to spend only a day or two at one location and appear in large temples when no one was around and offer service by reciting Vedic chants. I also heard that some people managed to locate him by the smoke emanating from a sacred fire and obtained his blessings by offering him food and money. He was said to be totally indifferent to money and other material things. Whatever he received from his devotees he gave away to the poor – so I heard. </P>
      <P>I am a skeptic by nature; perhaps it is due to my experience as lawyer and government administrator. Outside of stories found in our mythologies and epics, my knowledge of saints and selfless heroes is very limited. In my life of over seventy years, I have seen one, perhaps two or three persons that I would unhesitatingly call saintly. So, when I heard of the activities of this unusual character, I told the police to keep a watch on this modern day saint.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>They seemed to have done their job but a police uniform doesn’t change a man’s nature. I kept hearing stories about the man’s saintliness and supernatural powers even from </P>
      <P>The Kannada phrase used is ‘Maharshi of the Kali Age’. </P>
      <P>the police. </P>
      <P>“He is truly a saint, sir,” one policeman told me. “Whatever money he gets, he gives it all away to the poor. When asked ‘Why do you do this? Why not keep at least some for yourself?’ the great man says, ‘If I need I can make gold. I can make all the nine precious stones. But these are material things – like mud and clay. God has given me air and water. That is enough for me,’ he said.” </P>
      <P>“So, he is one of those extraordinary sages who can subsist on nothing but air and water,” I thought. I had read about them in some ancient works, but here was one in flesh and blood. Along with such naïve accounts by gullible policemen, there were also a few substantial reports. There was one about his taking money from a wealthy Brahmin landowner for ingredients for making gold and staying as his guest for several days. There was another about his visit to a village leader for some rituals to locate a hidden treasure. I also heard that he was especially compassionate towards widows and other women without guardians. This made me send for the police inspector. </P>
      <P>“You should make every effort to unmask this impostor before it stops being a joke,” I told the inspector. “If it goes on like this it won’t be long before we are held up to ridicule. Don’t leave it to junior policemen who seem to believe every cock-and-bull story put out by this man. I want you to take personal charge of this case.” </P>
      <P>This turned up the heat on the holy man, which seems to have scared him a bit. One day when I was visiting the Gunja Narasimhaswamy temple, I saw a stranger in saffron clothes seated in the inside portion of the temple. He was a red-faced, burly man in his forties, with long black hair and a flowing beard. I guessed him to be the holy man who was sanctifying my taluk with his presence. </P>
      <P>“This body is nourished by more than just air and water,” I said to myself. </P>
      <P>As I was leaving, he made a sign for me to come to him. I called out to him to come to me if he wanted. He stood up and came to me and asked speaking in Tamil, “I need to see you in private to discuss something. When can I come?” </P>
      <P>“I am leaving for home,” I told him. “You can come by after about half an hour.” </P>
      <P>I reached home and waited for the man with intense anticipation. The holy man showed up in about thirty minutes. I had him shown into my study and offered him a seat. After a few minutes of silence, I finally asked him, “Why did you want to see me?” </P>
      <P>He replied in Tamil, assuming a very pompous manner. </P>
      <P>“The police in your taluk,” he said, “seem to have no sense of propriety. Paying heed to rumors and innuendo of small people, they are needlessly harassing me. I am a man of God and bear no ill will towards any living being. But their behavior reflects poorly on your reputation and the dignity of the office you hold. They are but small men, but you – you are the scion of a distinguished family. You should set them on the right path and save yourself from the unnecessary disgrace that may fall upon you.” </P>
      <P>I was infuriated by his presumption. I could also see that his speaking in Tamil was pure affectation. I have lived in the Tamil country where I studied and practiced law. I could see that he was a local speaking the corrupted Tamil of the Srivaishnava Brahmins, native to Mysore. </P>
      <P>“There is no need for such high flown rhetoric,” I told him, speaking in Kannada. “Your problems are with the police. What has my family reputation got to do with it? Your Tamil suggests that you are a local— a Srivaishnava Brahmin from these parts and not an outsider. Your physical appearance does not suggest a life of extreme austerity that you are credited with. Is it true that you can create gold? Is it true that you can locate hidden treasures?” </P>
      <P>His Holiness descended from his lofty perch, condescending to speak in the local language which he spoke like a native. </P>
      <P>“It is the belief of students of modern science – like yourself – that creating gold is impossible,” he said. “There is little to be gained by arguing with you about the matter. Many villagers approach me believing that I possess some supernatural powers. I am not responsible for what they do and what they believe. But one thing I can tell you. I happen to possess complete mastery of the ancient science of Ayurveda. I can prepare for you an extraordinary potion containing pearls, gold, coral, secret essences, and other precious ingredients. If you take it for fifteen days, you’ll see its effect yourself. It’ll cost you only a hundred rupees for fifteen days’ supply.” </P>
      <P>“Though I have never been ill myself,” I replied with a laugh, “I have known a few other experts like you. One of them was Krishna Pandit from my ancestral village of Devanahalli. He was known as Krishna Pandit the Lame. Our local poet Narayana Shastri wrote a couplet about him that went like this: </P>
      <P>“ Mighty Krishna Pandit the Lame, </P>
      <P>Sent patients to Heaven and acquired fame.” </P>
      <P>“There was another in Bangalore, near Siddikatte, whose name I forget. He and his elder brother were renowned for dispatching people with their medicines. They were always generously rewarded by the heirs who inherited the wealth of the departed. The two brothers are now living as guests of the Government – in the Bangalore Jail. Does your treatment also relieve me of my worldly concerns?” </P>
      <P>He ignored my sarcasm and said that what he had to offer was a preparation more potent than any aphrodisiac known. It would increase my sexual potency a hundred-fold. I could not control myself. </P>
      <P>“Your Holiness!” I burst out. “I am just a Brahmin householder supporting a wife and two daughters on a government salary. What would I do with a hundred-fold increase in my potency? The Nizam of Hyderabad, the Sultan of Turkey, and other such princes and potentates with vast harems – they are the ones who could use your talents. You may be a master of the occult arts, but you don’t seem to know who your customers are.” </P>
      <P>Then I became serious and gave him a stern warning. </P>
      <P>“Enough of this,” I said. “Do you expect me to believe such nonsense? I don’t know what exactly you have been up to so far. But if I hear of any harm to anyone from you, you can expect to feel the full weight of my authority. I don’t care where you are from but you better leave my taluk and return to your place. The air here – you are said to subsist on air – may soon not agree with you. Get out!” </P>
      <P>Within a few days of this meeting, a leading merchant and landowner of Talkad by name Shivabasava Devaru came to see me. I asked him the reason for his visit. With great reluctance he told the following story. Here is the story in his own words, with Mr. Devaru speaking in first person: </P>
      <P>“A few days ago a poor Brahmin of my acquaintance – Koti Kanyadana Tatachar – came to see me. After much persuasion he told me that a famous holy man from Melkote<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>was staying with him as his guest. He said that this man had the secret of making gold but he first needed a hundred rupees for ingredients. </P>
      <P>“Should I give the money to him?” Tatachar asked me. “You are a trusted friend. You know my condition – a poor Vedic with little knowledge of the world. I need your advice.” </P>
      <P>I felt sorry for the poor Brahmin. He was from a good family, had lived well in the past but was now mired in poverty with a large family to support. I told him to bring the holy man over. </P>
      <P>“He is a proud sort of man,” Tatachar said. “He doesn’t like to go to see anyone.” </P>
      <P>So I went to see him myself. I asked him if it was true that he could make gold. He told me he could, but he first had to perform several rituals like Hiranya-homa, puja, and so on. He also needed some ingredients for making gold. </P>
      <P>“You don’t have to take me at my word,” he assured me. “I will give you a demonstration. I can first prepare a small quantity of gold. Once you are convinced we can make tons of it.” </P>
      <P>It piqued my curiosity. I told him to make a tola of gold. If he convinced me, I could ask him to make more. </P>
      <P>He demanded a hundred rupees for expenses. When I asked him to account for it he named miscellaneous items costing about twenty rupees and eighty rupees for something he called ‘Gandharva Bhasma’ or Angel’s Ash. </P>
      <P>Melkote, not far from Mysore, is an important centre for the Srivaishnava sect of Brahmins. Its founder Ramanujacharya spent his last years at the place. </P>
      <P>“What is this Angel’s Ash?” I asked him. </P>
      <P>“Ah! I cannot tell you that,” he said coyly. “It is a secret known only to me and my teacher.” </P>
      <P>I let go at that and gave him a hundred rupees. </P>
      <P>He returned a couple of days later and said he was ready to make gold. He would be setting up the fire altar in the small shed in my garden. I made all the necessary arrangements. His altar was a simple affair, consisting of an iron brazier surrounded by a row of bricks. He started a charcoal fire and reciting some chants threw some salts and pieces of copper wire into it. He then pulled out a snuffbox from his waist and took out a few pinches of a coarse gray powder, which he threw it into the fire. I immediately saw through his trick. </P>
      <P>As a boy, I had found that rubbing mercury on gold foil produces such gray granules of gold amalgam. When placed in fire, mercury evaporates leaving the gold behind. So this gold amalgam was his Angel’s Ash! His plan was to gain the person’s confidence with this simple chemistry experiment and then steal him blind. </P>
      <P>This is exactly what happened. When the fire cooled, a small quantity of gold was left in a corner. </P>
      <P>“Do you see it?” said the scoundrel in a triumphant tone. </P>
      <P>“Of course I see it Your Holiness,” I replied.” I paid for it, so I’ll take it.” </P>
      <P>I then took him inside the house, into my strong room with the vault. I opened the vault and showed him four bags filled with gold coins. </P>
      <P>“You poor holy bastard!” I said to him. “What do you know about making gold? Here is the gold I have made – all done without cheating a soul. Now get out of town. Else I’ll personally deliver you to the police.” </P>
      <P>Then, feeling that a scoundrel like this should not be allowed to go around cheating our people, I decide to come and report to your lordship”. </P>
      <P>I thanked Mr. Devaru for his public-spirited act and asked him to repeat the story to the police inspector whom I sent for. Devaru repeated the story but left out the detail about showing the impostor the bags of gold coins in the vault. We both felt there was nothing to be gained by advertising his wealth. </P>
      <P>“This man is getting a little overactive,” I told the inspector. “You should also increase your activity.” </P>
      <P>We still didn’t have enough evidence to charge him with a crime and arrest him. But he soon overreached himself and fell into our hands. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>Tatachar, the poor Brahmin who had brought the holy man to Devaru, misinterpreted the whole proceedings. He believed that Devaru was using his wealth to get the holy man to make tons and tons of gold for him. This made him despondent. He felt it was only his poverty that prevented him from reaping the benefits of the holy man’s skills. </P>
      <P>“These are the fruits of poverty,” he bewailed to his wife. “If only I had the capital to finance his gold-making, I could become a millionaire. Now the rich Devaru will use him to become richer. You and I will remain forever poor.” </P>
      <P>Tatachar heaped scorn on his impoverished state. Moved by his anguish, his gentle wife gave him her gold waistband – a gift from her mother – and told him to sell it and use it as capital for his gold-making enterprise. Tatachar took it and handed it to the holy man. The scoundrel sensed that the place was getting a little too hot for him and took to his heels. The police who had kept a watch on him caught up with him, as he was about to cross the taluk boundary near Belakawadi. By then he had shaved off his beard and long hair and exchanged the saffron robes of the holy man for the unprepossessing attire of an ordinary Vedic Brahmin. He had about five hundred rupees on him when arrested. </P>
      <P>Investigations revealed that he had a criminal record, having served two or three prison sentences. He had the all qualifications necessary to be called a K.D. (known depredator) – or a felon with a record of convictions. Trying a man of his distinction lay beyond the scope of my court. So his case was heard in the court of the subdivision officer (SDO), presided over by none other than the SDO V.N. Iyer. The SDO was distressed that a man of such obvious learning was engaged in deceiving innocent people. He thought it was worth trying to reform him. In his court, the hearing took a strange turn. </P>
      <P>The arguments between the prisoner and the judge (V.N. Iyer) before the case was committed to sessions court was said to be very interesting, with both parties quoting profusely from ancient works and scriptures like the ‘Mahabharata’, ‘Bhagavata’, the ‘Gita’ and the ‘Upanishads’. Lawyers, policemen, and others present in the court, were spellbound by the learning and erudition displayed by the participants— especially the prisoner. They had the feeling of being present at a great centre of learning like Benares or Kanchi, or in an assembly of sages in an ancient hermitage. When the prisoner was finally transferred to the Mysore jail, inspector Channa Raj Urs told me that the entire police force was in tears. It was probably an exaggeration, but I felt it had a grain of truth. Anyway it ended the career of this scholar-impostor. </P>
      <P>This desire to convert criminals into saints is probably as old as mankind. Such stories melt the hearts (and brains) of good people, but rarely have the desired effect. I too had one such experience while Amildar of Yedatore. After a great deal of difficulty we had managed to apprehend a well-known undesirable by name Ramalinga. As he was known to be a slippery customer, I handed him over to a Dafedar by name Parijat Narasimhachar, instructing him to take the prisoner to Yedatore and place him in the security of the sub-jail. I thought no more about it as I had to be away from the taluk for a few days. </P>
      <P>When I returned to Yedatore, I was told that Ramalinga had escaped by assaulting the Jamedar as he was being taken to the sub-jail. This surprised me. Jamedar Narasimhachar was a large, powerfully-built man while Ramalinga was a small, wiry fellow, handcuffed and shackled as he was being taken to Yedatore. The Jamedar also had a police constable with him. This made me suspicious. I sent for Narasimhachar and asked him for a complete account. </P>
      <P>“The prisoner was ill at the time of arrest,” Narasimhachar told me, “and also suffered some injuries in the scuffle as he was being arrested. He fainted on the way to the sub-jail due to weakness. I sent the constable to a nearby village for some water and also a cart so the prisoner could be transported in comfort.” </P>
      <P>This was most unwise, but worse was to come. The prisoner next complained that his leg shackles were causing cramps and begged Narasimhachar to remove them, suggesting that they could be put back once the cramp subsided. The Jamedar, a man of exemplary compassion, dutifully obliged. To his utter disgust, the prisoner, in gross violation of trust, simply took to his heels. Narasimhachar was deeply hurt by this deplorable show of ingratitude. He gave chase but the prisoner rapidly put distance between the two and disappeared into the wilderness. </P>
      <P>“Victory and defeat are in the hands of God,” said Narasimhachar philosophically. </P>
      <P>I was annoyed but also felt sorry for this elderly saint in uniform. There was nothing to be done now, but I was in for a surprise. The same day, when I was in court hearing the case, the escaped prisoner Ramalinga presented himself to me and said, “Here I am my lord! What do you want me to do?” </P>
      <P>“I heard that you escaped by assaulting the Jamedar,” I replied, taken aback by the turn of events. “What made you come here and surrender?” </P>
      <P>“I wasn’t planning to escape,” he explained. “My wife is expecting, so where would I go? But along the way, this police priest bored me to death with his sermons. When I couldn’t stand his talk any longer I gave him the slip. The poor fellow, he himself removed the shackles allowing me to run for cover. I had the handcuffs broken when I reached my village.” </P>
      <P>“What you did, escaping from arrest, is a violation of the law. Let that be for the moment. What did the Jamedar tell you that you found so impossible to bear? Was it so bad that you had to run away at great risk?” </P>
      <P>“Listen my lord!” said Ramalinga with a sigh. “‘Your present miserable condition is the result of bad karma in your previous life,’ the Jamedar told me. ‘It is still not too late if you place your trust in Lord Krishna and repent.’ ‘It is a long way between Lord Krishna and people like me,’ I told him. ‘But I do give a few coins and a coconut at the temple and a small fee to the priest when I have the money.’ ‘O you sinner!’ the Jamedar said. ‘That is not enough. I’ll tell you what you need to do’.” </P>
      <P>“He told me, and he told me. Listen my lord, and he kept telling me. We reached Melur, and he still kept telling me. We reached Ankanahalli, he was still telling me. He was like a torrential rain that won’t let up for a minute. He said I should give up everything I do and sit in one place and spend day and night chanting ‘Rama, Rama, and Krishna, Krishna.’ ‘All well and good,’ I asked him. ‘But who is going to take care of my wife and children?’ Jamedar said, ‘If you follow what I say, God will take care of your family.’ ” </P>
      <P>Then Ramalinga told me how he managed to escape. It differed somewhat from Narasimhachar’s account. </P>
      <P>“I told the Jamedar that I would follow his advice,” Ramalinga continued, “and asked his permission to go into the bushes to relieve myself. He agreed and removed my shackles. I went into the bushes and then just ran away. The police tried to follow me, but he was not a man who could catch me. This, my lord, is the story of my escape.” </P>
      <P>I turned to Narasimhachar and said, “You see Jamedar, when you retire from the force you can exchange your uniform for saintly robes and follow the Gita, the Bhagavata, and other holy works. But as long as you are in the service we have to go by the Penal Code and police rules and regulations.” </P>
      <P>“My good fellow!” I told Ramalinga, “You say your wife is expecting a child. Try to be decent and stay out of jail until she has her baby and is fully recovered. Then, if you still haven’t learnt anything from the good Jamedar’s advice, come back to me. I’ll send you to a more suitable place.” </P>
      <P>I gave him a suspended sentence, asking him to report regularly to the police. </P>

      <H3>28 TEMPLES AND POLITICS </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Rama Rao gets entangled in a dispute over temple protocol. The generosity of a famous seer. A troublesome clerk. Excavating some historic temples. Kantha Raje Urs shows his nobility. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>I have great love and respect for our temples, especially those that have stood the test of time, commanding the devotion of the people for many generations. When people attend temple services, at least during the time they participate in it, their hearts are pure and souls free. They approach their maker with purity of heart, which allows their better qualities to come to the surface. The fragrance of their purity tends to persist like a musical tone stored on a gramophone record, constantly filling the temple, resulting in an atmosphere of permanent sanctity and purity. When we approach such places of worship in the proper frame of mind, the sanctity and the purity of the place enter our hearts and souls and make us better persons in the long run. This is my firm belief based on long experience. Whenever I visit a place, I always visit a nearby temple at the time of service. Even in those days, I would go before the idol of the Lord, who would stand before me as a concrete image and not just as an abstract object of my devotion, and pray: </P>
      <P>“O Lord! Bless me, my people, my country, and bring happiness and prosperity to the whole creation.” <SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>My story so far probably makes it obvious that I hail from a Madhva-Deshastha Brahmin family of Vedic tradition. Although I respect my </P>
      <P>It is based on the famous Sanskrit prayer: sarve jana sukhino bhavantu – let all people be happy. It may be stated that Rama Rao was a devout but not orthodox Hindu. He was a Maratha Brahmin, often called Deshastha. He came from an illustrious family that included saints and scholars that are still honored centuries later. The most famous of these was Navaratna Purushottamacharya (1743 – 1830) better known as Satya Dharma Tirtha, Pontiff of the Uttaradhi Mutt 1794 – 1830. </P>
      <P>tradition, following it by choice, I am not sectarian in my day-to-day dealings with people. I hope this is also clear from my story. And yet, I once had to face the charge of favoring a Madhva religious figure – against the Maharaja’s own religious teacher no less! It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>The most important festival of T. Narsipur is the ‘Rathotsava’ (chariot festival) of the Gunja Narasimhaswamy Temple. This was not just a local festival; it attracted devotees from all parts of the taluk and beyond. At one time it must have been popular among people from all castes and sects of the area. Even in my time most communities used to participate except for some Veerashaiva sects. </P>
      <P>The Gunja Narasimhaswamy Temple is a public institution administered by the state. It has a large staff on small salaries, but capable of big mischief. About three-fourths of them are Srivaishnavas belonging to two different sects. Although they fought among themselves over trivial things, they were united in claiming the special privileges due even to the most minor priests of their sect. The result was that even elderly men and women, including Brahmins, had to wait their turn until these self-important men had finished their service and meals. Only when I visited the temple, as the Maharaja’s representative, would I be served tirtha immediately after the royal priest. Then, out of respect for his age, the elderly teacher Nagavadhani would be served followed in order by Krishna Shastri and Venkatarama Shastri. This was the protocol. </P>
      <P>One year, a few days before the annual Rathotsava, I received a communication from the Madhwa Pontiff of Vyasaraya Math of Sosale intimating that he would like to be present at the festival. His representative met me and asked if there was any objection on my part. I was, of course, delighted. I was sure the devotees attending the festival would also feel honored to see a major religious figure in their midst. So, I sent back a reply saying that we would all be honored by his presence. It was a public function anyway; anyone, including a religious head, was free to attend. </P>
      <P>This was my initial, if impulsive reaction. Upon a little reflection, it struck me that there was a difference between just anyone attending and a major public figure, especially a religious head paying a ceremonial visit. The latter would have to be accorded special treatment. Common devotees come to offer to worship, while a religious head comes to receive honors including worship. Sectarian differences also come into play. Most devotees don’t care about these niceties, but as the official of a state-owned temple, I could not afford to be indifferent. If the Pontiff of the Maharaja’s own religious sect were also to attend, how was I to handle the protocol? To settle this, I sent for my supply officer and the temple manager. Both were Srivaishnava Brahmins, and also intelligent, experienced men. They gave me the following opinion: </P>
      <P>“Should the Pontiff of Parakal Math (the Maharaja’s teacher or the Rajaguru) and any other pontiff attend the festival the Rajaguru receives the honor of the first service. If only the representatives of the two religious sects are present in person, the Rajaguru’s representative receives the first honor. But if the Rajaguru’s representative and the Pontiff of any other sect should be present, the Pontiff receives the first honor above any representative. In other words, every Pontiff takes precedence over any representative as far as the temple is concerned. This is the standard protocol.” </P>
      <P>This seemed eminently logical, one that should satisfy any sensible person. So I gave directions to follow this procedure with regard to the Sosale Pontiff who had expressed his wish to attend the festival. If I had not taken such a decision but allowed scope for arguments by scholars and theologians, I would have had on my hands a marathon dispute that was unlikely to be settled in my lifetime.<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> So what I had done was not only logical but also practical – at least as I saw it. But I had not counted on the ego of petty religious officials with their capacity for mischief. </P>
      <P>To be on safe ground, I had a written report on the procedure to be followed, prepared and signed by the temple manager. On the following day, the day of the festival, the Pontiff left Sosale by boat and arrived at </P>
      <P>It is interesting that the longest legal dispute on record, lasting nearly 800 years, was over a similar controversy, relating to the right of passage of a temple procession in Poona, in Western India. (This is according to the Guiness Book of Records.) Several empires rose and fell in that time. So the temples must have retained their claims through the ensuing centuries. </P>
      <P>half past eight in the morning along with his retinue. I received His Holiness at the ghat where his boat docked. I took him by the hand and presented the customary honor s due to him from me as the Maharaja’s representative in the taluk. I next led him to the temple, surrounded by thousands of inquisitive devotees. He was old and infirm, so I had to practically carry him all the way up the steps. I stayed with him in the temple and also near the chariot with the idol as he performed his pooja. After the completion of his duties, I took him back to his boat and saw him off as he left for Sosale. It was past eleven by the time he left. There were no objections from anyone during his presence; instead, the devotees were genuinely happy. </P>
      <P>It was now time for the chariot procession to begin. Enthusiastic devotees were there by the thousands. Hundreds of them came forward, looking for a chance to pull the chariot. I was also there with a few of my friends to start off the proceedings by ceremonially pulling the chariot rope. As the sun was strong, we were standing under a small tree waiting for the signal to begin. Just then we heard a commotion. Someone seemed to be standing in front of the chariot, trying to stop it from being pulled. I sent the police officer with me – one Jamedar Shamanna – to go and report on the problem. </P>
      <P>“It is getting quite warm,” I told him. “Many, including women and children, are waiting for the procession to start. It will take nearly two hours for the chariot to reach its destination. We cannot delay it any further. Please go and make sure that there are no obstacles to starting the procession.” </P>
      <P>The Jamedar left for the place. But the commotion, instead of subsiding, got only worse. So I went there myself. I saw an assembly of Brahmins from surrounding towns and villages – Narsipur, Sosale, Gargeshwari, and others – all talking at the same time. At the centre of the assembly was a clerk working for the Parakal Math – the seat of the Maharaja’s Pontiff or the Rajaguru. (His name was Narasimhachari as I remember.) He claimed to be the representative of the Rajaguru. They became quiet when they saw me. </P>
      <P>“To whom did you present the first honor?” the clerk asked me. </P>
      <P>I turned to the temple manager and said, “Tell him.” </P>
      <P>The temple manager explained why the Pontiff of Sosale had been given the first honor. </P>
      <P>“So, the Subedar’s Guru takes precedence over the Maharaja’s Guru </P>
      <P>– the Rajaguru!” </P>
      <P>I checked my rising anger and said, “The Rajaguru was not here in person, but the Pontiff of Sosale was. He is not my Guru for I belong to the Uttaradhi order. But he is a venerable elderly figure with many followers in the land, worthy of honor and worship. It was proper that he should be honored before anyone else. I don’t have to answer anything to this clerk. I am only bringing the facts to the attention of the public and the people present here.” </P>
      <P>Following this, I briefly explained the reasoning as given by the temple manager. Some said it was proper that a venerable sage should be honored wherever he goes.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>But some others insisted that whatever rights a man has, they belong to his representative also. As example, they cited that the tax is paid to the Government, though it may be collected by the Patel or the Shanbog. We are not asked to pay taxes separately to each official. </P>
      <P>I thought this an absurd argument, an exercise in sophistry. </P>
      <P>“If you feel that the temple manager’s decision was improper,” I told them, “please file a complaint. We can examine the records for precedent and also consult scholars and scriptures. We can set the rules for the future. But for now the festival must go on. Please clear the way so the chariot can be drawn without further delay.” </P>
      <P>Most people agreed and moved away from the path. But the clerk pulled himself up to his full height and said, “No sir! It is a religious festival only when proper procedures are followed. Otherwise, it is just a mob.” </P>
      <P>“Why don’t you tell us what you feel is proper?” I asked him. </P>
      <P>“The procession should be stopped,” he replied. “The chariot should be taken back to the starting point. The chariot should be re-anointed by the temple priests. The necessary honor and service should be </P>
      <P>In Sanskrit — yati sarvatra pujyate. </P>
      <P>offered to the Rajaguru’s representative (meaning himself). Only then can the procession begin.” </P>
      <P>The insolence of this petty official made me lose my temper. </P>
      <P>“What rubbish!” I shouted back at him. “You seem to be without any sense of shame. Is this the Lord’s festival, or a clerk’s festival? Get out of this place!” </P>
      <P>Then I turned to the police Jamedar and said sternly, “Remove this fellow for obstructing a public function.” </P>
      <P>The clerk left in a huff, without waiting for police hospitality. A few – very few – joined him in the walkout. Some others, mostly temple workers, who seemed to be vacillating, got to their stations as soon as my eyes fell on them. The chariot festival went on grandly without any more trouble. The people also participated with their usual joy and enthusiasm. </P>
      <P>When I went back home, I thought about the whole situation calmly. It was clear that I had placed myself in an awkward position. What I had done was both right and expedient. But the Pontiff of Sosale (Sri Vyasaraya) is a Madhwa sage. Although I belong to a different sub-sect (Uttaradhi), I too am a Madhwa Brahmin and hence he is honored by me. But these fine distinctions will not be apparent to outsiders or they may not care. They may see it simply as a Madhva official using his authority to present honors to a Madhwa seer ahead of the representative of the Maharaja’s Guru. This of course was the impression that was sought to be created by the opposing camp. </P>
      <P>I felt that both law and tradition were on my side. I had also the records and the signed statement of the temple authorities. I decided that I would prepare a detailed report and submit it with supporting documents to my superiors. But there was no telling what mischief my adversaries might create with their lurid tales. So, I took steps to ensure that they would not reach my superior officers and prejudice them with their stories before my report could reach them. I left for Mysore the same evening and also made arrangements so that Narasimhachari (Rajaguru’s clerk) would not be able to get transportation to go to Mysore until the following day. I am not going to defend what I did. All is fair in love and war – it is said. My goal was only to prevent false stories from being circulated before I had a chance to present my side based on facts recorded in the official report. </P>
      <P>Upon reaching Mysore, I saw the deputy commissioner (DC) Kantha Raje Urs and gave him a detailed report, leaving out nothing. I told him that I had full confidence that what I had done was just and proper. But I was also concerned that my position might be misunderstood in the palace, leading to the Maharaja’s displeasure. This could hardly help me, for I had always held the goodwill of our rulers to be my greatest asset. </P>
      <P>Kantha Raje Urs agreed with me. He told me not to worry about any unhappiness on the part of the royal family. He suggested that I should go and see the Maharaja’s Pontiff (of Parkal) and explain my actions to him. This would avoid causing him any distress. Then he thought over for a little while and said, “Those trying to explain their innocence before being charged with any guilt will only be accusing themselves. So, it is better that I see His Holiness of Parkal myself and explain the whole thing to him. I’ll let you know what comes of it.” </P>
      <P>I returned to Narsipur. Soon, a campaign of anonymous petitions began. There was a flood of anonymous letters addressed to everyone – the Maharaja, the Queen Mother, the Diwan, the DC and the subdivision officer (SDO). These seemed to originate in every town and village in the taluk, while a few of them came from such places as Tirupati, Melkote, Kanchi and Sriranga. According to them, I surpassed Ravana in my arrogance; as a tormentor of the innocent, I was the equal of Hiranyakashipu. God had created me by taking a drop of blood out of each and every one of the monsters and tyrants filling the pages of our history and tradition. These petitions were all of one kind in language and style. It was apparent that they were the handiwork of a single master poet. They all eventually made their way to the DC’s office. He sent me a few and consigned the rest to permanent oblivion in the DC’s office records. </P>
      <P>What ultimately saved the day was the fair-mindedness of the Pontiff of Parkal Math – the Rajaguru. He issued a public statement supporting me and my action. He said that to do otherwise – presenting the honor to his clerk before the Sosale Pontiff who was present in person – would have amounted to disrespect to a brother Pontiff whom he held in the highest regard. He thanked and complimented me for my sense of duty and respect for tradition. His generosity filled me with respect and gratitude. </P>
      <P>After all the smoke had cleared, I sent for the clerk Narasimhachari. He tried to evade me, but I made sure that he was served the summons when he was in town. </P>
      <P>“You see, no harm came to me from all the anonymous petitions you wrote,” I told him. “If I am really as evil as your letters make me out to be, I could easily have destroyed you by now. I am not vindictive by nature, but I don’t like people who create a foul atmosphere. If you don’t reform yourself, if you insist on raising a stink, I can send some sewage cleaners who will take care you? Be careful!” </P>
      <P>I accompanied him all the way to the main door of the building and told him, “Please don’t forget what I said Mr. Narasimhachar.” I had no more trouble from him. </P>
      <P>I had a much more pleasant experience in restoring the five ancient temples in the T. Narsipur taluk. Its results also proved more lasting. The great jatra relating to the pancha-linga remains vivid in my memory even after all these years. The Mysore Gazetteer states that this event comes about once every twenty years. The Gazetteer that makes this statement is not the beautiful, original Gazetteer by Lewis Rice, but the bloated misshapen monstrosity produced by the quack that succeeded him.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>It is inaccurate and shows complete ignorance of the place’s history and tradition. The actual date of the event is determined by the position of the stars in the Hindu month of Kartika. This auspicious event can come about once in two or three years; or it may also take twenty or even thirty years. When the right configuration of stars made the Pancha-linga Mela possible when I was Amildar, there had not been one for some thirty years. </P>
      <P>This great event was expected to attract devotees from all over India, especially South India. Those old enough to remember the previous jatra told me that the number of visitors would approach two or even three lakhs. Already, a month or two before the event, there was </P>
      <P>C. Hayavadana Rao. </P>
      <P>intense business activity in villages within four or five miles of the temples – villages like Talkad, Muduktore, Hemmige, Mavinahalli, and others. There were people and agents looking for shops, living accommodation, fields, and farms. It became clear to me that the jatra would touch every resident of the taluk regardless of rank and social position. It would mean pilgrimage for the devotees, business for traders, additional revenue for the Government, opportunities for thieves and vagabonds of all description, a fertile source for infectious diseases, and additional burden for government officials especially the Amildar. There was an upsurge of enthusiasm all over the taluk that cut across castes and creed. I was approached by the leaders of large villages offering me facilities to camp in their village for the event. </P>
      <P>Although I had overseen many jatras, this one was going to be exceptional, surpassing all others in size and importance. I felt it would test my ability as an official and even determine my future prospects in the Government. I felt also it was my duty to ensure that the jatra was completed without a hitch. This would bring me accolades from my superiors; above all it would bring me the satisfaction of having successfully discharged a major responsibility. </P>
      <P>The panhca-lingas or the five Shiva temples are the following: Vaidyeshwara, Maruleshwara, and Pataleshwara located in Talkad; Vijayeshwara located in the riverside village of Vijayapur; and the Mallikarjuna Temple on the Mudukutore hill. The pilgrims would begin by bathing in the lake adjacent to the Vaidyeshwara Temple in Talkad and worship in the three temples, and bathe again. From there, they would proceed to the Vijayeshwara Temple in Vijayapur, some three miles from Talkad, and then return to Talkad for another dip. On the final leg of their pilgrimage, they would visit the Mudukutore Mallikarjuna Temple after which they would head to Talkad again for the final dip in the lake that would conclude the pilgrimage. </P>
      <P>To prepare for this elaborate pilgrimage involving lakhs of visitors, I got together all the village leaders as well as the caste and community leaders from the surrounding areas to thrash out the problems we might face. The main issue was the selection and co-ordination of the various applications for space and living arrangements. These leaders saw me not as an official, but as a friend and colleague interested in working with them. This made them speak candidly, which was a matter of great satisfaction to me. I gave them the following broad instructions. </P>
      <P>I would allot each village space from government lands in accordance with its population. It was the responsibility of the villagers to erect shelters for visitors according to instructions to be provided by my office. They should regard these as temporary villages. It would be the responsibility of the officials of each village to administer these temporary villages as their own. This mainly meant providing water and sanitation facilities to the residents of these temporary villages. In other words, from the viewpoint of administration, each temporary village was to be treated as part of the existing village. The leaders expressed satisfaction with my scheme. </P>
      <P>Following this, we went to visit the five temples in the order in which pilgrims visit them. It was clear that a great deal work lay ahead of us. The pushkarini, to be used by the pilgrims, was unfit for bathing. It was filled with algae, and had to be thoroughly cleaned. The Vaidyeshwara Temple was buried in sand right up to its tower, with only a narrow opening leading to its main door. The other two temples of Talkad – Pataleshwara and Maruleshwara – were completely buried in the sand with only the tops of the towers showing. God only knew how long it had been since any kind of worship or service had taken place at these temples. </P>
      <P>Legend has it that the loss of these temples to sand was the result of Queen Rangamma’s (or Alamelamma’s) curse. As she was being pursued by the Raja Wodeyar of Mysore, before throwing herself into the river (c. 1600), she cursed that the place be buried in the sand and also that the rulers of Mysore be without progeny. Talkad and its temples had remained under the spell of her curse, though the Maharajas of Mysore, through their righteous conduct have managed to escape her curse. <SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Not entirely. Only those rulers who were adopted as heirs have had heirs </P>
      <P>born to them, not those who were born to ruling kings. For example, </P>
      <P>Krishna Raja III (died 1868) adopted Chama Raja who became Maharaja </P>
      <P>upon attaining majority in 1881. His son Krishna Raja IV (ruled 1894-1940) </P>
      <P>had no children and adopted Jayachama Raja as his heir. Jayachama Raja </P>
      <P>(ruled 1940-48) had several children including a son Shrikanta Datta. True </P>
      <P>... </P>
      <P>The sorry state of the temples made us all unhappy. I gave voice to what everyone was thinking when I said, “These temples have brought us much fame. Their blessings have brought peace and comfort to us and to our elders. We should ensure the same blessings for our children and grandchildren. We are fortunate to be participating in the panchalinga festival after many years. Devotees will be coming here from many lands and far-off places. If they are disappointed like us today – by being unable to see the Lord – the disgrace will fall on us. We can earn the gratitude of the devotees for generations to come by restoring these temples from the grip of sand. Just as our rulers escaped the effect of Alamelamma’s curse with their righteous rule and conduct, Talkad also can escape the curse by serving the Lord by restoring his temples. What do you have to say?” </P>
      <P>This met with wholehearted agreement from the assembly. It was now a question of channeling their enthusiasm to achieve our objective </P>
      <P>– the restoration of our ancient temples. <SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>We agreed on the following arrangements – able-bodied men in each village should contribute one week’s labor to the task of removing the sand. When they come for work, they should make arrangements </P>
      <P>... to the pattern, Shrikanta Datta has no children though he is no longer the ruler. So Rani Rangamma’s curse has held for every prince born to a ruling Maharaja while it has spared adopted heirs. Medical scientists suggest this was due to some generatic disorder, the result of marriages between close relatives for several generations. </P>
      <P>Rangamma (or Alamelamma) was the wife of the chief of Talkad whom Raja Wodeyar (ruled 1578-1617) defeated and killed c. 1600. He then tried to capture Alamelamma with her jewels who cursed him and the land he conquered before committing suicide by jumping into the deep Malangi trench in the Kaveri. Raja Wodeyar tried to make amends by building a temple in her honour and regularly offering prayer. This story was well known to his readers when Rama Rao wrote this passage (1952). </P>
      <P>This suggests that the accumulation of sand and the disappearance of the </P>
      <P>temples into the sand dunes began about that time, c. 1600. It is remarkable that unlike a modern archaeologist, Rama Rao and his associates approached their work not as antiquarians but as a continuation of their living tradition. There is a lesson here for Indian archaeologists: their work is part of a living tradition and not a resurrection of lost civilizations like Egypt or Mesopatamia. In the face of this it is absurd to claim that Indians have no sense of history. </P>
      <P>for their food and other provisions also. Those unused to manual labor should either furnish a substitute or contribute enough provisions for three workers. In every village, the arrangement for men and supplies was the responsibility of the Patel organized through the caste and community leaders. The contribution that each village would make should be submitted to the Amildar within a certain date. Upon receiving the list of contributions from each village, the Amildar would organize the work, allotting the men and supplies to each temple to be excavated, and also providing the necessary work detail including supervisors in charge. </P>
      <P>All told, I received a list of eight thousand volunteers for the work and the necessary supplies. Many of them came willing to work not just for a week as originally stipulated but ten days. I prepared a time and work schedule to excavate the temples in a month.<SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>To supervise the work, I set up camp in Talkad itself, going to my taluk office only as necessary. I set up a temporary office under a tree on a sand dune, and even held court hearings in the open! As work progressed, and the temples slowly emerged from the mountain of sand, the enthusiasm of the workers knew no bounds. As the news of our work spread, volunteers and devotees began to arrive even from places outside the taluk like Kollegal and Malavalli. Many people brought provisions and other supplies, which they contributed free of cost. Some others set up temporary eateries to feed the workers, also free of charge. </P>
      <P>Upon observing the devotion and loyalty of thousands of men working voluntarily under my direction, a senior friend and official from Mysore jokingly remarked, “Had you been living in earlier times, you could have ruled over them as their chief.” </P>
      <P>“I collect their devotion and loyalty,” I replied, “only to be delivered to the Maharaja, just like the taxes they pay.” <SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>When the work was in full swing, I invited the DC Kantha Raje Urs to visit Talkad. He was absolutely delighted to see our work. He promised to bring the Maharaja and other members of the royal family for the </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>This would now be called PERT chart, except that it was not in use at the time. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>This ‘senior friend and official from Mysore was Councilor Srinivasa Iyengar as previously noted. </P>
      <P>pancha-linga service. A minor episode during his visit brings to light Kantha Raje Urs’s large-heartedness. It came about as follows. </P>
      <P>On his trip to Talkad, Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs had brought his car. Cars then were quite unlike what we use today. They were mostly smoke and noise with very little power. On his way back, his car got stuck in the sand that had fallen on the road. (The roads also were not made for automobile traffic.) Much as he tried, he could not get his car out of the sand. Cars being rare those days, some of the men standing by were watching the proceedings as a form of entertainment. When we asked for help, a whole lot of them – many more than necessary – decided to join the fun and push the car out of the sand. They managed to get it out, but in their enthusiasm they also slightly dented its ‘mudguard’, or what we now call the fender. This was too much for the Sirdar. </P>
      <P>“You ruffians,” he shouted at them. “What do you think this is? A cart for hauling manure? Look at what you have done.” </P>
      <P>The poor fellows retreated, feeling somewhat ashamed. He took me with him in his car and dropped me off at Mudukutore. He was quite depressed by the whole thing. </P>
      <P>“Did you see my petty behavior Mr. Rama Rao?” he said as he left me. “Are you not disgusted with me? These poor fellows only came to help me. What right did I have to call them such names? Was I born with a car? Am I such a big man to call them fit only for hauling manure? Will God approve of such conduct?” </P>
      <P>“Oh, that is nothing sir,” I replied, trying to comfort him. “You should see and hear me when I lose my temper.” </P>
      <P>Even after this he was full of remorse for having hurt their feelings. </P>
      <P>Another episode that took place around the same time shows the differences in human nature. I received some hints suggesting that people in the Public Works Department were unhappy with the work we were doing, mostly clearing sand. They probably saw it as encroaching on their turf. One sub-overseer (junior construction supervisor) in their department had the habit of dropping by our work site and ridiculing the volunteer workers. </P>
      <P>“Why are you fellows slogging here for free?” he would say. “Don’t you have anything to do in your village?” </P>
      <P>I warned him not to meddle with our work or workers. One morning, I happened to be by the river, awaiting the arrival of volunteers from Moogur and surrounding villages. As the river was too deep for fording, I had arranged for a few harigolus (rafts) to ferry them across. I soon saw the vessel leave the opposite bank with some twenty or twenty-five men including a couple of jangamas. These men used to entertain the workers by singing popular songs accompanied by a stringed instrument. The sub-overseer was also in the raft. As it approached a point not more than fifty yards from the Talkad bank, there was a scuffle and the sub-overseer slapped a jangama. There was a sudden commotion and the raft began to sway dangerously as other people on board also joined in the scuffle. I asked my trumpeter to give a few blasts on the trumpet, making signs to calm down. When the commotion died down, I shouted at them to stay calm, telling them that I would hold an inquiry. </P>
      <P>As they came off the boat, the men seemed furious at the sub-overseer. He was already unpopular with my men. I don’t know what would have happened to him if I had not intervened. I calmed the people down and asked the sub-overseer to report to me especially his reason for slapping the jangama. He was very angry, and only said that he was not my subordinate and didn’t have to answer me. I got the details from others who were with him on the boat. They told me that the jangama lost his balance and fell on the sub-overseer who was standing next to him. </P>
      <P>“Have you no sense, you bastard!” the sub-overseer shouted. </P>
      <P>“It is your father who is a bastard,” retorted the jangama. </P>
      <P>One word let to another and the sub-overseer slapped the mendicant. That was when I intervened and stopped it from going any further. I asked the sub-overseer if this was true. He again repeated that he was not my subordinate and he had no need to answer me. I asked my orderly to hold the sub-overseer firmly in his arms, and told the jangama to give him a couple of slaps. </P>
      <P>“Never, my lord!” he protested even as he gave the sub-overseer a couple of juicy slaps. </P>
      <P>This pleased the crowd, which dispersed greatly amused by the rough and ready justice. But the sub-overseer was understandably furious. </P>
      <P>“People who gave you authority must have no sense,” he said. “Is there no law or justice here? Do you think you are a dictator? I am also a government employee like you. I’ll report the whole matter to the executive engineer. Or the deputy commissioner,” and so on and so forth. </P>
      <P>“Listen to me, sir,” I told him patiently. “If I had not intervened when I did, they would have beaten you to a pulp. Or they might have thrown you into the river – who knows? Officially you may not be my subordinate, but you are still subject to the authority of my court. I am the law enforcement authority here. If they had filed a charge against you, I would have to try you in my court for creating disturbance and sentence you. This might have cost you your job. These people regard jangamas as holy men. You should have behaved more responsibly. Actually I have done you a favor by settling the whole thing out of court. A court record can only hurt your career. Take some time and think it over calmly.” </P>
      <P>He must have thought over it. I heard no more about the episode. </P>
      <P>We pretty much cleared all the sand accumulated over the temples. On two of the temples the sand was so deep that we had to drive crowbars and search simply to locate their roofs. The new bloated Gazetteer says thus about these temples: <SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>“Pataleshwara, Maraleshwara, Anandeshwara, and also Gaurishankara – these temples seem to have been only recently excavated from buried sand.” </P>
      <P>This refers to the Mysore Gazetteer compiled by C. Hayavadana Rao. The excerpts given here are not directly from the Gazetteer but English translations of Kannada translations given by Rama Rao. We feel they are not important enough to try and locate the hard to obtain Gazetteer by Hayavadana Rao. It is clear that Rama Rao did not think much of him. He was justifiably annoyed that the compiler of the Gazatteer had not bothered to find out who was responsible for the excavation. Anyone in Talkad would have told him. </P>
      <P>The same Gazetteer also intones: </P>
      <P>“These people seem to have done nothing believing it to be the result of a curse. They do nothing unless ordered by the Government.” </P>
      <P>This is amazing! The Gazetteer acquired its present bulk though a generous infusion of funds from the Government. Does its compiler think that these temples came out of the sand on their own, in response to a government order? Such are the ways of armchair historians! </P>
      <P>In any event, the pancha-linga festival was a great success. A large number of villagers came to Talkad and took care of the arrangements in the temporary villages in the places allotted to them. A lakh or one lakhand-a-half devotees visited Talkad for the event. A whole temporary town had been set up for their convenience. It included a line of shops, police stations, facility for helping lost and found children, lifeguards at the lake used for bathing as well as the usual arrangements for food, water, and sanitation. No one from the royal family attended except Kantha Raje Urs, accompanied by the Dalwai (army chief), many Arasu chiefs, and the Maharaja’s father-in-law, the Rana Saheb.<SPAN><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN>Kantha Raje Urs delighted in the devotional milieu of the occasion and promised that he would ask his sister, the Maharaja’s mother, to visit Talkad or Mudukutore. This did happen. I’ll reserve the story for a later occasion. </P>
      <P>The Maharaja had married a Rajput princess. </P>

      </P>
      <P>A major problem faced by any Amildar those days was filling leisure time. In his own small world, he was the lord of all he surveyed, which made him also a more or less public figure who was always exposed to the gaze of the subjects. His position was unique, because his authority was great and yet he was close to the people. Along with the weather and the news, the Amildar and his latest exploit was a common topic of conversation. It included such things as his friends, in particular those who commanded his favors and influence. There were often questions about the Amildar’s interest in music and the arts; whether it was limited to the arts or extended to the artists also. About me in particular it was said, “The Amildar is short-tempered, but kind-hearted. Though he doesn’t care about money, he likes flattery. One can have one’s way by flattering him. Is he attracted to women? Outwardly he may seem so, but not really.” One often heard such questions and gossip. </P>
      <P>This was my general experience. The best way to deal with it is to ignore it. It is not easy for a person in authority to find sincere friends. I have to say this with some reluctance; when such an official is friendly with someone, he may jump to the conclusion that favors can be obtained through his friendship. Or others may try to influence the official through the friend. But there are also happy exceptions. When I was working on my wrestling at a gym, I cannot recall anyone there trying to gain favors from me. When I was in Yedatore as Amildar, I was on friendly terms with an elderly Pathan by name Rahman Khan who for a while taught me fencing as practiced in his country. He never accepted a single pie in return. He also refused to oblige his fellow Muslims who tried to put pressure on him to gain favors from me. I learnt of it only much later, that too from others. </P>
      <P>The same was true of our boatmen with whom I was on friendly terms. They were often in trouble with the law – mostly for petty offences like small theft and fighting – most of the time because of their insatiable thirst for drink. This would bring them to my court. They never once complained or tried to bring up the issue of their friendship or former services. </P>
      <P>“I did a stupid thing my lord!” was their usual defense. “I am a poor man; please don’t fine me. Just give me a short sentence. I’ll serve it.” </P>
      <P>Whenever I had to sentence them, they accepted it philosophically, without a trace of anger. </P>
      <P>“What can you do, my lord? I have to reap what I sow.” </P>
      <P>I recall an occasion when a boatman serving a sentence had done excellent work growing a small garden in the prison yard. I complimented him on his work. The police guard told me that he was to be released the next day. </P>
      <P>“Aren’t you Ajjun Nayaka?” I asked him. “If you can do such excellent work outside the prison also there is no need for you to spend time inside it. You are being released tomorrow. From now on, at least, try to be sensible.” </P>
      <P>A week or so later, the police brought him again for some violation or other. I was angry, but also sad. </P>
      <P>“You jackass! You were released only last week. Didn’t you know better than getting into trouble again? Are you a man or an animal?” </P>
      <P>“No, my lord!” he replied without a trace of bitterness. “I still need to finish the garden I started. The rose cuttings have to be replanted and watered properly. I’ll finish it this time. I won’t come again – I promise.” </P>
      <P>He spoke true to his nature; not as a criminal. I was surprised and saddened by his attitude. </P>
      <P>Leisure is not easy to mange for a sociable person, especially one used to civilized activity. It is human nature to share one’s happy experiences with others. When this is not possible, one has to find other hobbies to fill one’s time. I used to spend some of my leisure time in riding and hunting. I had two horses and I used to ride at least fifteen or twenty miles a day, visiting villages in the taluk. This provided me with intimate knowledge of the people and their problems. But there was little scope for hunting in Narsipur taluk. I wasn’t keen on shooting birds and deer. Let alone forest, there weren’t even clumps large enough to hold tigers and leopards in the populous taluk. One could on occasion shoot a crocodile or two in the rivers. This brought some relief to cattle owners but there was little real sport involved. </P>
      <P>What saved me from boredom were two things – violin lessons from my venerable senior friend Shamanna and my strenuous efforts to learn French language and literature on my own. </P>
      <P>Shamanna is none other than the hero of the story ‘Subbanna’, </P>
      <P>1</P>
      <P>written by my friend Masti. He has put together the bits and pieces I gave him about the extraordinary life story of Shamanna and turned it into a literary masterpiece. It is no ordinary work, but one that brings to life the travails of a great artist trying to find peace in his art. </P>
      <P>Here is how I got to know Shamanna. On the occasion of the Sri Rama festival in Narsipur, I heard a young violinist by name Venkatasubbaiah who was the Shanbog of Alagod. I was stunned by his artistry. I may have heard two or three violinists with a tone as beautiful as his. I have known celebrated musicians with ten times his knowledge and skill. They would have given anything for a tone like his. But Venkatasubbaiah neither desired nor received any fame.<SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>Exceedingly shy, he was in his element only before a small audience of friends and acquaintances. His was a talent like a buried treasure or a fragrant flower in a deep forest. One does not expect to hear such divine music from a village clerk in Alagod. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, Rama Rao’s close friend and biographer, was one of the leading figures in modern Kannada literature. His long story or novelette Subbanna is probably the greatest work of its kind in Kannada. Masti owed the subject of the story to Rama Rao, which he acknowledges in the preface. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN>Actually Venkatasubbaiah was fairly well off and a recluse. The Maharaja offered to make him a court musician but he declined. There is even a short biography of Venkatasubbaiah. So he was not altogether an unknown. Rajaram heard him a couple of times in 1960, but by then he was in decline and tired easily. The golden tone was still there even if only for brief periods. </P>
      <P>To describe his tone, I can compare him only to Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>When I first heard Dwaram, it reminded me of poor Venkatasubbaiah’s playing, especially the tone. When it comes to musical knowledge, Naidu is like an ocean; Venkatasubbaiah was but a puddle in comparison. But the beauty of sound and taste raised my poor friend to the same level as the great master. I say this with some knowledge of music, for I too have ‘scratched the violin’ for many years. My views on his playing are based on this knowledge and Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu </P>
      <P>(1893 – 1964). The picture</P>
      <P>experience, as well as the opinions of </P>
      <P>shows a young and vigorous</P>
      <P>several knowledgeable friends and other </P>
      <P>looking Dwaram, not the frail musicians. artist most fans remember. His admirers included</P>
      <P>After his recital, I approached him, and </P>
      <P>Yehudi Menuhin. </P>
      <P>spoke to him in a friendly fashion, complimenting him on his playing. </P>
      <P>“Your music was wonderful!” I told him. “Who taught you to play so divinely?” </P>
      <P>He pointed to an elderly, somewhat portly man with a dark complexion seated at the corner of the temple and said, “The blessings of that great man.” </P>
      <P>I had seen him a few times at the temple. He was a solitary man, seemingly in a world of his own, entirely absorbed in thought and reflection. As soon as the mangalarathi was over, the old man got up and left leaning on a cane. </P>
      <P>A few days later, I ran into Venkatasubbaiah again. “I must hear your master play,” I told him. “Can you bring him over to my place?” </P>
      <P>A celebrated violinist (1893-1964) of the first half of the century, known especially for his beauty of tone, admired among others by Yehudi Menuhin. </P>
      <P>“He has not touched the violin in perhaps twenty years,” he told me. “He destroyed his violin and threw it away in the river. He never goes anywhere or sees anyone. He is like that. You must not misunderstand his behavior.” </P>
      <P>Destroy his violin? And reject music altogether? Was he like Diogenes who hated mankind? Or was he another Timon of Athens, embittered by the treachery of friends? As I got to know him later, I found he was like none of them; he was neither a misanthrope nor a victim of ingratitude. He was a passionate soul tested by such grief and misfortune as would have felled a lesser man, who had finally found peace by freeing himself from attachment and hatred.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>I have seen him in the company of children playing and laughing like one of them. Each day, he would go to five houses and collect alms, which he would often distribute to the poor and the sick and sleep without food. </P>
      <P>I invite everyone to read his life story as narrated by Masti in his wonderful story ‘Subbanna’. There is no point in my repeating it here. Nor does it make sense to compare my account with his. My goal here is only to describe Shamanna as I saw him and relate how we became intimate friends in spite of our very great difference in age.<SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>I used to run into him at temples, sometimes bathing in the temple ghat or on the street. At first he ignored me, avoiding my eyes as he walked past me. Then I took to saluting him with folded hands, which he would return in the same manner, with a dignified expression. On a few occasions, when I had recitals arranged at my place, I managed to get him to come with a special invitation sent through Venkatasubbaiah. A few times, when he was ill, I went to see him to ask if he needed any help from me. He would just laugh and say: </P>
      <P>“Lord Parthasarathy himself is driving my chariot. What more do I need?” <SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>The words in the original are raga-dvesha translated here as ‘attachment and hatred’ – not altogether satisfactory. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>Fifty years or thereabouts. Shamanna was a young musician when Krishna Raja III was the titular king of Mysore, having been deposed by the British in 1831. He still held court and supported artists. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>This refers to Krishna driving Arjuna’s chariot on the battlefield in the Mahabharata War. </P>
      <P>I visited his dwelling, if it could be called that – a narrow platform attached to the temple, a few ragged clothes, a mat on the bare floor, vessel for carrying alms, a clay lamp and a stick. Was he a character out of our epics, like Partha or Bhishma, I wondered? And how real and concrete his vision of God seemed to be! </P>
      <P>When the plague struck Narsipur, people had to leave their homes and live in camps outside the town. The families living in the five homes that he used to visit for food also had to leave town. As the plague swept across the taluk, it was a hectic time for me with a great deal of travel and other work. I had set up a camp for my family also in the yard of the traveler’s Bungalow. I had all members of the family inoculated and left to visit other places in the taluk. When I returned after more than a week, I ran into Venkatasubbaiah and asked him how Shamanna was doing. With tears in his eyes, he told me, “I begged him to come and stay with me until the epidemic passed, but he refused. Then I took him food for a few days. All of a sudden, one day, he disappeared without telling me. When I inquired around, I learnt that he had moved to a deserted shrine by the river in Madapur. I went to see him. When he saw me, he became furious and said, ‘Have you come here also to bind me? If I see you again I’ll leave this place.’ He is a very stubborn man. I went to the Patel of Madapur and begged him to take care of my teacher. Madapur is a Lingayat village, so they cannot feed him. They can only give him fruits and milk. I left some money with the Patel.” </P>
      <P>My wife’s heart melted at the story. </P>
      <P>“Should that poor old man die alone, with no one to care for him?” she asked. “Why doesn’t someone go and get him here.” </P>
      <P>“I can’t cry like young Venkatasubbaiah,” I said half in jest. “My method is to arrest those unwilling to come and bring them by force. I can’t use that here. So why don’t you go yourself and use your powers of gentle persuasion?” </P>
      <P>I intended it as joke, but my wife took it seriously. She insisted that I take her to Shamanna. I was planning to go anyway, but she insisted on going with me. We took the cart and went to Madapur, some five miles from our place. </P>
      <P>We found Shamanna seated in the open porch of a small shrine. He stood up as soon as he saw us, and spread the humble mat before us, offering it as a seat in a style indicative of a man who had known better days. </P>
      <P>“The lady and the gentleman should please sit down,” he said. “You have travelled far to see this poor man. What can I do for you?” </P>
      <P>“We’ll tell you if you’ll promise to say ‘yes’,” my wife told him. </P>
      <P>“What is this madam – like the Lord coming to Kuchela’s house for alms?” <SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>“Grandfather! You are not Kuchela,” replied my wife. “And I don’t have to tell you that we are not Yadava rulers. You are certainly not a man struggling for food and clothes like Kuchela. And Kuchela was no musician like you. All I have to ask you is this. You must come home with us and teach music to my daughters Brahmani and Venku. I too play the veena. I am a bit rusty and I want to get back to playing. You must help me also. I’m not going to take no for an answer.” </P>
      <P>Shamanna gave her a hard look. First there was a frown of annoyance that gradually gave way to a smile, which he seemed to want to suppress. Then it burst out into a loud laugh. He kept smiling and finally and said, “So madam! Husband and wife have come to trap me and take me home. What I planned was one thing and God’s wish is another. All right! Let God’s wish be fulfilled. I’ll come, but on one condition. I’ll stay in your house only during the lessons and for meals. At other times I’ll not be under your roof. I’ll be at the nearby Mooleshwara Temple. You must understand that I am a barbarian who doesn’t mix with people. You must excuse my lack of sociability. Another condition: I may leave and go any time – without reason or notice. You should not object.” </P>
      <P>We agreed. He returned with us in the cart to Narsipur and stayed with us for two months. During this time he taught my wife and daughters music and also read and explained the Jaimini Bharata.<SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>He </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>A reference to a famous story when the Yadava prince Lord Krishna visited his impoverished devotee Kuchela and accepted his hospitality. </P>

      <P>literature. Apparently it was more popular than the older Kumaravyasa </P>

      <P>was with us for the duration of the plague epidemic and then returned to his usual life of solitude. But our music lessons continued and I too, joined his students to improve my violin-playing. He became quite cordial with us and would come over for meals whenever invited. He grew especially fond of my second daughter Venku Bai. A couple of years later I was promoted and moved to Bangalore. As our cart was leaving Narsipur, he came to see us and took leave of my daughter with tears in his eyes. The scene is beautifully described in Masti’s ‘Subbanna’. </P>
      <P>He unexpectedly paid us a visit in Bangalore, giving Venku some toys he had brought for her. He made her sing some devotional songs he had taught and returned after staying with us for two days. With great difficulty, I made him accept a gift of a pair of dhotis. But typically he insisted that he would exercise his right as their owner and gave them away to his pupil Venkatasubbaiah. Shamanna was one of the most unusual men I have known. </P>
      <P>Next a few words about my study of French. My younger brother Navaratna Krishna Swamy had spent many years at the French enclave of Pondicherry. He often spoke glowingly of the French language and its literature. During his visits he used to bring me some French books. With his help I read a couple of them. His enthusiasm proved infectious. I purchased an excellent French dictionary and several outstanding literary works and began an independent study of French literature. I began by devoting two hours to it every day. </P>
      <P>The work I chose was the famous novel ‘Les Miserable's by Victor Hugo. It is large in bulk and demanding in language and style. Initially, I found it a hard nut to crack. But I have teeth of iron and a will of steel. At first it was hard for me to finish even one page in the two hours I had devoted to French each day. Gradually, the language began to yield and I began to appreciate the work. Once in a while I would go to Srirangapttanam and get help from a French priest by name Father Lorenge who lived there. Along with ‘Les Miserable’s’ I read also some lighter works like stories and short poems. It took me six months to finish ‘Les Miserable’s’. Then I also read works by Guy de Maupassant, Voltaire, Balzac, and a few others. After I finished reading Hugo, my knowledge of French reached the point that I could read any book in the <SPAN>language without difficulty. It opened the door to the literature of another cultured Western language. <SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P>But the language one acquires from reading books is limited: not a dead language perhaps, but a sleeping one. For it to come to life, one must hear it spoken by native speakers of the language. And then, one should speak the language well enough for others to follow it without difficulty. Even though I can claim to read ‘book French’ fairly well, I found it quite useless when I went to France. When I spoke what I thought was French, people found it impossible to follow me. When they spoke French, they ran their vowels and consonants together in a manner reminiscent of the way native Tamilians speak Tamil. It frequently left me baffled. By the time I could grasp the first word, the sentence would be over. After I had spent some time in France, I was filled with admiration for their mastery of spoken French. “Splendid,” I thought, “These people really know how to speak their mother tongue.” </P>
      <P>Even though my mastery of the violin and of French may be said to be on the same level, they have both provided me with many hours of enjoyment and also the means of filling my leisure time. </P>

      <H3>30 QUEEN MOTHER VANI VILAS </H3>
      <P>
        <strong>Vani Vilas, the mother of the Maharaja, plans to visit Narsipur. Disappointment followed by triumph. A folk drama takes an unusual turn. Diwan Madhwa Rao tries once more and fails. </strong>
      </P>
      <P>As we were excavating the temples Kantha Raje Urs had told me that he would try to get some member of the royal family to visit them, especially those of Mudukutore and Talkad. Thanks to his efforts, his elder sister (and the Maharaja’s mother) Maharani Vani Vilas<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN>decided to visit the area. I received her itinerary along with instructions to make arrangements for her visit. The deputy commissioner (DC), Kantha Raje Urs, promised me full support and all the facilities necessary for the arrangements. He wrote me personally informing me that he had spoken highly of me to his sister and that if I were to create a good impression on her during her visit, it would be reflected in the Maharaja’s attitude towards me. He pointed out that it was an excellent opportunity for me to improve my standing in the Government at the highest level. </P>
      <P>Of course, I knew all that. But such an opportunity is a double-edged knife that can cut both ways. To begin with, I had no experience entertaining royal visitors or making arrangements to suit their high taste. I knew Kantha Raje Urs well, but I saw him more as a friend and </P>
      <P>Maharani Kempa Nanjammanni, better known as Vani Vilas, was the wife of Maharaja Chama Raja Wodeyar and the mother of Krishna Raja IV. She had ruled as regent during Krishna Raja’s minority, from 1894 to 1902. She was an important figure in the building of modern Mysore, who supported progressive causes like women’s education. She endowed the women’s hospital in Bangalore that is still known as the Vani Vilas Hospital. Kantha Raje Urs was her younger brother and also married to his daughter. Marriages among close relatives was common in those days, especially with the aristocracy. He had served as her secretary during her regency. </P>
      <P>senior colleague than as royalty. Not every prince and princess is as understanding and easygoing as he was. I had also heard that the Queen Mother was a somewhat willful person, used to having things her own way. I have already related the problems a previous Amildar had – when I was still probationer – when the Maharaja visited Megalapur. </P>
      <P>I saw the DC and expressed my pleasure at the opportunity and gratitude for the honor. I then consulted a few Amildars and other officials who had experience hosting royal visitors and asked for their suggestions. They told me it was a difficult task. The first task was to make sure that there was money available to provide enough supplies to everyone at low cost. Royal visitors, their courtiers in particular, tend to be long on demands and short on payment.<SPAN><Sup>2</Sup></SPAN> One should always be available and do everything possible to keep the palace staff in good humor. The person who told me this left me to imagine what all this involved. </P>
      <P>“After the visit is over,” one told me, “and after the torrent of anonymous complaints has ceased, thank your favorite God for leaving your honor intact and enjoy peaceful sleep for a week.” </P>
      <P>“It is a thankless task,” said another. “It is a profitable venture for little fellows, while all blame falls on the Amildar,” said a third. </P>
      <P>There was nothing to do but shoulder the responsibility. I saw Kantha Raje Urs and gave a detailed report of my plans for the visit and requested him to come and inspect the arrangements personally. The arrangements briefly involved the following: painting the trees along the highway with stripes of red mud and lime; setting up a well-decorated reception porch at the taluk boundary with royal signs as well as banners expressing loyalty and devotion. We also needed young men and women to greet the royal party with cheers and songs. Most important of all, we had to set up a temporary facility to house the royal visitors and their entourage. </P>
      <P>This has been Rajaram’s experience also on a few occasions when he had the ‘opportunity’ to entertain so-called royalty and aristocracy in India and Europe. A friend with a good deal more experience with Indian royalty described them to Rajaram as ‘pucca kanjush’– utter misers. </P>
      <P>The last was a formidable task. Mudukutore was in those days a settlement with a dozen or so houses with tile roofs. In the surrounding groves there were a few Veerashaiva Mutts, mostly stone structures. There were also some open buildings; relatively primitive facilities for visiting devotees. It was nothing but a temple village with some dilapidated buildings that served to house an occasional visitor or two who didn’t mind the primitive conditions. At the time of the jatra, the whole place would acquire a life of enchantment with thousands of temporary shelters, and then return to being the sleepy village which it was. This place was now asked to host the royal party! </P>
      <P>In those days it had a small Inspection Bungalow for visiting government officials. As I recall now it was a tile-roofed building with a living area twelve feet by ten feet, and a front porch (or verandah) extending for about six feet in front. For four nights, this humble place had to house the visitors who had grown up in royal comfort. The job was made particularly difficult by the fact that the Queen Mother would be leading a party of royal ladies. They could hardly live like ordinary women. Her party included twelve members of the royal family, her chamberlain known as the Baxi (or the Durbar Baxi) and a staff of about fifty. Nominally their expenses would be paid to the taluk by the palace according to local rates. In reality, what was paid would not cover even a tenth of the total expenses. I would need facilities way beyond what was possible in a backwater temple town like Mudukutore. I would have to put together teams to attend to each and every detail. </P>
      <P>To give an example: the camp would require a daily supply of fifty seers of fresh milk. Remember, there were no refrigerators in those days. It was hard enough to get even one seer of extra milk in Mudukutore. The Queen Mother’s visit meant also the visit of the DC and his staff along with other invited and uninvited guests. All these had to be taken care of. The first task was to erect a temporary enclosure wall around the Inspection Bungalow using bamboo and cane. It was decided also to enlarge the Inspection Bungalow. The DC told me to go ahead and finish the job; that he would get the expenses sanctioned later. I felt it was best to be frank with Kantha Raje Urs. </P>
      <P>“It is of course on honor for me to host the Queen Mother,” I told the DC. “It is an opportunity for me to prove myself. But it is also a test of my ability and character. I am confident that I can discharge this responsibility to her satisfaction. But I need your full support. The work needs a lot of money. There is no point in hiding the truth. What my office can bill the palace covers only a fraction of the total cost. The real cost will be twenty or thirty times that. I have a good idea of the costs based on the experience of those who have hosted such affairs. This is not merely an official visit, but a festive occasion for everyone in the taluk. So, we must solicit and get the help of private parties to meet the needs of the occasion.” </P>
      <P>I then gave Kantha Raje Urs a detailed account of what all was involved. </P>
      <P>“What do you suggest we do then?” he asked. </P>
      <P>“First we must set up a reception committee to take care of the program and arrangement for receiving the royal party,” I replied. “This should be strictly a private affair run by the leading citizens of the taluk with no government involvement. I will arrange it so the Committee itself will raise the funds necessary for the program and reception. I will make sure that no government employee touches this money. I will provide staff support for book-keeping and administration so they are all in order. For erecting porches and other temporary structures we will need both materials and labor. I’ll put competent people in charge of each and make sure that everything is done under my personal supervision. We have a lot of work but we don’t have much time.” </P>
      <P>“It is fine with me,” said Kantha Raje Urs. “What support do you need from me?” </P>
      <P>“I should have your complete trust as regards my ability, judgment, and honesty,” I replied. “You must ignore any anonymous petitions that you may receive. After all, the people working on this will not be without enemies. We cannot accommodate everyone who wants to be involved. There is bound to be some envy at someone like me getting this honor." </P>
      <P>“I understand. You may work without fear.” </P>
      <P>“You should also visit us once in a while,” I told him, “encourage workers and help us with suggestions.” </P>
      <P>“Certainly Mr. Rama Rao,” he replied. “After all, it is my responsibility also.” </P>
      <P>This relieved me of most of my concerns. I set up a reception committee made up of leaders from each caste, community, and profession from all over the taluk. I set up branches of the committee in the larger towns like Bannur, Sosale, and Moogur and a central committee to co-ordinate the branches. I appointed one Krishna Rao as president and gave him staff consisting of a secretary, a treasurer, and a writer-clerk. They were housed in an office created for them. They were to report directly to me. </P>
      <P>In those days, the people’s affection and devotion for their rulers was real. So we had no difficulty raising the necessary funds and materials. Beginning with the Labbeys of Gargeshwari and the Dayireys of Bannur, people came forward with generous contributions. We collected thousands of rupees through their subscriptions. </P>
      <P>We brought Muslim craftsmen from Mysore for erecting and decorating shelters and Medas from Moogur and Nanjangud to prepare mats and roofs of bamboo and cane and other skilled workers to prepare temporary shelters for the camp. I made arrangements for fruits and vegetables to be supplied from Bangalore. I also made arrangements for musicians to entertain the Queen Mother and her party. We invited Venkataramayya of Rudrapatna, a famous veena player, to be present at the camp. It was his misfortune that he was a contemporary of Veena Sheshanna (1852 – 1926). Had he been born in a different era, he might have gained greater recognition than he did. Musically speaking, there was little to choose between him Sheshanna.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>The greatest difficulty we had was getting enough milk. I had to virtually set up a dairy farm in Mudukutore importing some one hundred and fifty cows and buffaloes from neighboring villages. A temporary facility for them and the staff to take care of them had to be built in a grove adjoining the village. Keeping them supplied with fodder was a major headache. It is a peculiarity of cows that some of them give </P>
      <P>Happily Rudrapatna – a seat of great Veena players – has kept the tradition to this day. R.K. Suryanaryana and his elder brother Srinivasa Murthy (both recently deceased) are justly celebrated as great artists. </P>
      <P>less milk when moved to an unfamiliar place. They can be as temperamental as humans.</P>
      <P> Kantha Raje Urs came and </P>
      <P>inspected our arrangements a week </P>
      <P>before the scheduled royal visit and </P>
      <P>expressed full satisfaction and </P>
      <P>complimented me for my </P>
      <P>thoroughness. Two days before the </P>
      <P>visit, the advance guard of the party came to inspect our arrangements. They were known as avasarada sibbandi as I recall. It was led by a small group of self-important men in sartorial splendor. Two of them were Brahmins, who were known to Krishna Rao, president of the reception committee. I knew they would be trouble, so I asked Krishna Rao to use his influence with them to make the inspection go smoothly. It was futile. They were bent on showing off their importance. They proved a bloody nuisance. </P>
      <P>We did our best, entertaining them with lavish food and a music recital. It was a waste of money. They went around trying to frighten my staff that there would be no visit unless they gave a favorable report on the arrangements. They made a practice of looking for minute errors and harassing my staff. I suspected they were expecting bribes. I finally managed to bring them around. It happened as follows. </P>
      <P>One of them complained that the milk was bad and that it went sour immediately after being boiled. I called the milkman and the inspector in charge and gave them a dressing down and asked them to inspect the arrangements thoroughly. Finding nothing wrong, I supplied a fresh batch of milk. The milk inspector came back a few minutes later and told me in secret that I would find out the cause of the problem if I went to the camp immediately. This was only a few yards from where I was. When I went there, I saw one of the palace officials, the one who complained about the milk, dipping his hand into the large vessel in which the new supply of milk had been kept. The inspector caught him red-handed with lemon on his hands and shouted to me, “Look here, sir, this man is ruining the milk by dipping his lemon-soaked hand in it.” </P>
      <P>Other workers also joined him. As we had firm evidence, his hand still smelling of lime, he could not escape. I gave him a severe warning. </P>
      <P>“I am the local magistrate here,” I told him sternly. “And I have the authority to try you for this.” </P>
      <P>Then I called the Shirastedar and gave him a warrant to search his place. He found a stock of lemons and a bowl filled with juice at his lodgings. So I had enough evidence to try him. He was brought before me by the inspector and the supply officer. By then his whole attitude had changed. He fell at my feet and begged me not to report him to his superior officers. His companions were also greatly subdued. I decided against charging him. There was no need to antagonize them at this point. I felt it was better for me to keep it in reserve, as a potential weapon for future use, should the need arise. In general, I found these palace officials to be full of bluff. Their real importance never measured up to their self-importance. </P>
      <P>In any event, I completed all the arrangements to my satisfaction. I rode the whole route, covering every detail of the royal visit in the form of a dress rehearsal. It involved covering a distance of sixty-five miles on horseback. My two horses proved unequal to the task, so I had to borrow two more from others. Everything was to my satisfaction. When I returned to camp, I found a courier waiting for me with an urgent letter from Kantha Raje Urs. I eagerly opened and read it, “Due to an unexpected auspicious event, Her Highness Queen Mother has had to postpone her visit. Her eldest daughter, the princess, gave birth to a daughter this morning. <SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>Her Highness regrets the inconvenience caused and that so much effort put into the preparations should have gone to waste. Your extraordinary effort has been reported to her.” </P>
      <P>Her eldest daughter was none other than Kantha Raje Urs’ wife. </P>
      <P>I will leave it to the reader to imagine the depth of my disappointment; I cannot describe it in words. For a moment, everything seemed to go blank before my eyes. The same news had been sent to the palace workers also, ordering them to return immediately. I had no choice but to control my disappointment and </P>
      <P>This daughter was Princess Lilavati. </P>
      <P>convey the news to those who had come to work as volunteers and console them. I also sent a letter congratulating Kantha Raje Urs with the same courier who had brought me the bad news. In the same letter I wrote: </P>
      <P>“Please convey the following request to Her Highness, the Queen Mother. Even though her visit to Mudukutore had to be cancelled because of unforeseen circumstances, she should favor us with a visit as soon as possible.” </P>
      <P>Fortunately my request was honored before the preparations could be wound up; I received another letter informing me that her visit was only postponed by fifteen days. I received also the new schedule. This meant that I had to revive all the committees and organizational activities that were in the process of being disbanded. This was like reviving not a dead horse, but one that was dead tired. What amazed me was the love and devotion of our people who came back to their old tasks, still full of enthusiasm. We ran short of money, so I had to take personal charge of the matter. Kantha Raje Urs fully appreciated our position and made repeated trips to help us out. I cannot forget a particularly interesting trip to Kollegal, which turned out happily for me. </P>
      <P>He and I rode out to Kollegal. Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs was an excellent horseman. He had a whole stable of horses of all kinds. He was particularly fond of cross-country riding. As I am also fond of riding, he often used to take me along. My horse could not, of course, compare with his royal mount, especially when riding cross-country. At 175 pounds (80 kg) I was also a good deal heavier than he was. This combination of a heavier rider and a smaller horse made it difficult for me to keep pace with him. Still I kept pressing my horse to stay with the Sirdar and his mount. But this can go on only so long. My horse got tired and finally stumbled, with both the horse and the rider falling to the ground. Fortunately the ground was soft, and neither my horse nor I suffered any serious injury. But the Sirdar was distraught. He kept repeating, “How terrible! How terrible! One could get killed in an accident like this.” </P>
      <P>“My life is stubborn,” I replied, trying to make light of the accident. “Also, it is written that I should serve Her Highness on her visit.” </P>
      <P>Queen Mother: Young bride Kempa Nanjammanni (1878) and as Maharani Vani Vilas (with husband's portrait in the background c.1920) </P>
      <P>Soon after returning to Mysore, within two days, Kantha Raje Urs sent me a magnificent sixteen-hand horse suitable for cross-country riding. His name was Galway. I had never ridden such a wonderful horse </P>
      <P>– fit for a prince. I assumed that it had been sent to me for the duration of the work associated with the Queen Mother’s visit. But thanks to the Sirdar’s generosity it became mine. It happened as follows. During Her Highness’ visit I escorted her wherever she went, mounted on Galway. After she returned to Mysore, Kantha Raje Urs informed me that the horse was mine to keep, telling me only to take good care of it and enjoy riding him. As I was about to protest, he silenced me by saying that it was the Queen Mother’s wish that I should keep him. I accepted it as a royal command. </P>
      <P>The Queen Mother’s visit proceeded as planned and went without a hitch. She was a pleasant, easy-going person like her brother (Kantha Raje Urs) who did not demand much.<SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>She appreciated the devotion and affection shown in any task and always expressed her happiness openly. She was particularly kind to me and once requested that food from my camp be brought to her. This was too much for her chamberlain known as the Durbar Baxi. These court officials tend to suffer from an </P>
      <P>This was so with the common people and hard working government officials like Rama Rao. As the episode with the Durbar Baxi shows, with her own staff she could be both demanding and sarcastic. </P>
      <P>excess of self-importance mixed with insecurity. (Most of them do nothing important and can easily be dispensed with, which they know.) He told me that the favor of requesting food from my camp, which Her Highness bestowed on me, was only because of the good word that he had put in on my behalf. <SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>As he was telling me this, a maidservant from her quarters – they were known as ‘Avveys’ – came looking for the Durbar Baxi. As soon as she saw him with me she came to us and said, “Sir there was some sand in the taat. The dishes were not washed properly. Her Highness wants to know if the Baxi has no sense.” </P>
      <P>The poor Baxi was flabbergasted. </P>
      <P>“O! What to do with these workers?” he lamented. “They don’t even do simple chores properly. They ruin my reputation. Everything falls on my head. Enough! Who wants this job?” </P>
      <P>Then he appealed to the maidservant, now practically on his knees, “Good lady! I beg you. Before Her Highness moves, would you please inspect things yourself and clean plates before serving? Please beg her on my behalf and tell her this won’t happen again. I’ll supervise the cleaning myself. Please ask her to forgive me this time.” </P>
      <P>This gave me an idea of his standing with the royal family. From then on I dealt with his tall claims accordingly. Recognizing that Her Highness had a good opinion of me, the palace staff left me mostly alone. These men seemed unable to see the difference between my duty and theirs – that my primary job was to run the taluk and not keep royalty happy. The Maharani, having ruled as regent from 1894-1902, during her son’s minority, clearly understood this. </P>
      <P>Her Highness later invited my wife and me to her quarters and spoke to us, inquiring about our children and us most graciously, while staying behind a cloth partition.<SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>She then asked my wife to bring a dozen or so </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>More likely, it was because Rama Rao, as a Madhwa Brahmin, had a Madhwa cook from Udupi as his personal cook. Udupi cooks are known as the best in South India and almost monopolize the restaurant business even in places like Mumbai. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>This partition was only for the sake of privacy of the royal quarters, not to be confused with the ghosha or the seclusion of women practiced by Muslims. Being Hindus, the Maharani and the princesses appeared in public and mixed with people. The rest of the account makes this clear. (They also went to the same schools as their subjects.) </P>
      <P>‘Muttaideys’ (married women) from good families for the Gowri Puja to be hosted by Her Highness. My wife invited several ladies from nearby places like Talkad, Narsipur, Hemmige, and other places and took them to the Maharani’s quarters. The royal party included her granddaughters and five or six other princesses. There was a women’s durbar, in which some of the ladies sang and performed on instruments. My wife told me that Her Highness spoke freely with the invited ladies. </P>
      <P>A particularly attractive quality of the Queen Mother was her concern for the feelings of the less fortunate. This came to the fore during her women’s durbar. One of the women at the durbar was a large, dark, peasant woman of little sophistication who had brought her nursing child with her. As the baby began to cry, this simple woman began to breastfeed the child oblivious to the presence of others. This brought giggles and whispers from some of the more sophisticated ladies in the assembly – especially a few of the girls from Mysore. The Queen Mother would have none of it. She went over to the woman and said, “How fortunate you are, to be nursing a child like Yashoda nursing our Lord Krishna! Will you please bless our girls that they too may one day enjoy similar good fortune?” </P>
      <P>For the rest of the occasion, she remained close to that woman and honored her with presents for the child. Her personality reminded me of Lord Tennyson’s description of Queen Victoria: </P>
      <P>A thousand claims to reverence closed </P>
      <P>In her as mother, wife and queen </P>
      <P>The Maharani had the great veena player Venktaramayya of Rudrapattana play for her, and honored him suitably with gifts and money. She also visited the five temples making up the pancha-linga following the rules set for all the devotees. I always accompanied her to meet any needs. I had had a large boat with decorations and shelter built specially for her use. She used it for the teppotsava at the Mallikarjuna Temple and also for her own recreation on a moonlit night, which she greatly enjoyed. </P>
      <P><SPAN>I will relate another incident which brought to the fore the Maharani’s concern for the feelings of the less fortunate.<SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>When we visited the Kirtinarayana Temple and the Shiva temples of Talkad and </SPAN>Vijayapur, the Brahmin priests, who were trained in Sanskrit, were able to properly recite the Royal Prayer Rajarshirvada. At the Muduktore Mallikarjuna Temple, the priesthood is the hereditary right of barely literate rustic priests known as tammadi. They had some difficulty mastering the Sanskrit diction of the Royal Prayer. But they were keen to perform the service and present the offerings to the Maharani. It was their hereditary right, and they could also expect a generous gift of clothes and cash of hundreds of rupees from their ruler. They had even memorized the Royal Prayer for the occasion. I wanted to make sure that they could recite it satisfactorily. They showed they could manage it except for minor flaws in pronouncing aspirates and a few composite sounds. It was clear that they had gone to great trouble to learn it. I felt that they should not be deprived the opportunity of presenting honors to their Maharani, which obviously meant a great deal to them. </P>
      <P>The proceedings went smoothly, but when the moment for the Royal Prayer arrived, it was a minor disaster. Whether it was the excitement of the occasion or a memory lapse, the prayer learnt with such difficulty refused to come out. The poor fellow remained struggling but tongue-tied for more than a minute. He just froze. To make things worse, the Durbar Baxi became impatient and said, “It is getting late, let us proceed.” Finally, the poor fellow took courage in his hands and said simply in an atrocious accent, “Mantoni ginnantu tatastu.” <SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>Everyone present was thunderstruck. Their faces fell at the outrage. Only Her Highness kept her cool and said with a smile, “Why don’t you please tell us in the Kannada we all know – ‘All the elders bless that God Mallikarjuna and Goddess Bhramaramba may bring peace and prosperity to the Maharaja and his kingdom.’ ” </P>
      <P>With this she thanked him profusely for the service and rewarded him with gifts and cash. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN>In the Mahabharata the grandfather Bhishma tells Yudhisthira who had just assumed kingship: “Dear son! Remember that the powerless should never be hurt. Let not the tears of the weak burn you and your family!” This was the guiding principle of enlightened ruling families like those of Mysore. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN>A terrible mispronunciation of the last three words of the prayer – the only ones that he could recall. </P>
      <P>“Her Highness wants to see a Bailunataka,” said the Durbar Baxi to me. “Could you arrange a performance?” <SPAN><Sup>10</Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P> I told him I would check and let him know by the evening. Patel Puttey Gowda of Talkad was a well-known drama producer in the area. At one time he had put on the play ‘Nala Charitra’ for my family in the open area in front </P>
      <P>of the Traveler’s Bungalow. As women and children, including my own family, were in the audience, I had instructed him to tone down the racy parts. The place was filled with people who enjoyed the performance hugely. Their only complaint was that the Subedar had diluted the comedy parts. </P>
      <P>These performances, usually held in the open, mix music, folk dance and spoken dialogue. Their singing resembles the singing of Yakshagana, and is quite melodious.<SPAN><Sup>11</Sup></SPAN> The songs are based on familiar ragas, and the singing is robust and straightforward. It takes some getting used to, but one soon finds that it has its own rustic beauty. Its tala (rhythm) is not precise by the standards of classical music, but one should not expect rhythmic precision in such music any more than in the singing of a bird, a mountain stream, or wind blowing though trees. The play that I saw was excellent. When Nala leaves, abandoning his sleeping wife Damayanti in the forest while taking away half her clothes, the whole audience was in tears. They were consoled only by the sight of a sturdy pair of shorts underneath the unhappy princess’s torn sari. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN>A folk drama staged outdoors. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>11 </Sup></SPAN>Yakshagana is an elaborate form of dramatic art combining music and dance. Their subject is invariably drawn from Indian mythology and epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Of late they use contemporary social themes also but these have yet to produce a genius like Kalidasa. Traditional plays continue to be preferred. </P>
      <P>Patel Puttey Gowda was prepared to put on a play, but I was worried that the rough and ready language and acting may have elements that could shock the refined sensibilities of the Mysore princesses. I finally decided to check with the (DC). I suggested that we might put on a regular play instead – one that may be less crude. </P>
      <P>“They themselves want to see the kind of plays performed in the villages,” he told me. “They’ll have seen regular plays many times at places like Mysore and Bangalore. This is a rarity for them. So just arrange what they have asked.” </P>
      <P>“But if there is some offensive language or something, they may hold me responsible,” I replied, expressing my real concern. “They may think that this Amildar had no sense to expose these delicate ladies to such offense. Or they may feel that I did it deliberately – to shock them. I wonder if they could be displeased with me.” </P>
      <P>“That is always possible,” he agreed. “So you have to be a little careful.” That was hardly helpful. So I was on my own resources. </P>
      <P>For the performance, Puttey Gowda suggested Draupadi Vastrapaharana (‘Disrobing of Draupadi’) from the Mahabharata. “We just put it on,” he said. “The players know the parts well.” </P>
      <P>This made me tremble. Draupadi Vastrapaharana is the well-known story of the disrobing of Draupadi by the wicked prince Dusshasana in the Hastinapur assembly. Dusshasana of Hastinapur was of course defeated in his effort to humiliate her in public – thanks to the grace of Lord Krishna who made her garment infinite. But Dusshasana of Talkad, with no divine intervention, may prove victorious and succeed in stripping her and succeed also in outraging the modesty of our royal guests. </P>
      <P>“Let us leave Draupadi’s disrobing alone,” I told him hastily. The situation was fraught with danger. </P>
      <P>Finally we settled on Ramayana. I felt it offered no room for any outrageous mishaps. I told them to present it for the following evening. I wanted to see the actors. Puttey Gowda came with about a dozen men. There was a slight problem with the boy playing Sita Devi. (Women’s parts were played by men in those days.) This youngster was keen on growing a huge moustache, which was beginning to appear on his upper lip. He had set his mind on growing one, which of course he had to shave off if he was going to play Sita. This caused him great anguish. He suggested that he could always cover the moustache with his hand as part of his acting pose, but I turned it down. I pointed out to him that his moustache would grow again, but he may never get another chance to perform before royalty. Finally, after a great deal of soul-searching he agreed to sacrifice his budding moustache for the noble cause of serving the Maharani. </P>
      <P>Another problem had to be sorted out. A single actor has to play two or three different parts. This means that a fair amount of time is needed between acts for changing costume and settings. In village dramas, the usual practice is to fill this time with some form of comedy show. But the kind of comedy that our villagers appreciate is not the best fare for visiting princesses. We finally settled on a light farce. </P>
      <P>Its theme is as follows. A husband-and-wife team of thieves manages to escape from prison and go into hiding in fields and groves. Their idea is to somehow survive by petty theft when possible and by begging otherwise. But the hardness of a life on the run leads to endless arguments and fights between husband and wife. One night, they arrive dead tired at the home of a wealthy farmer and settle down to rest in the front porch of the house. Hearing some dogs barking, the lady of the house comes out to see them. Taking pity on them, she brings them some raw flour and buttermilk. The hungry couple feed themselves by mixing flour and buttermilk and drinking it. This soothes their anger and revives their spirit. The two, who were at each other’s throats, soon find each other attractive. As they begin their romantic activities, the police arrive and take the poor couple back to the prison. </P>
      <P>For reasons that I am unable to understand, villagers find this highly amusing. In village dramas, of course, they show the fight between the two and their later romantic reconciliation quite explicitly. When I first saw this short episode I felt that it reflected the dullness of family life, the ephemeral nature of happiness and unhappiness in life, and the general helplessness of poor people in society. I felt it was not unlike the moral tales found in the Upanishads. </P>
      <P>This farce was to be used to fill the interlude needed to change Dasharatha into Sugriva, Kausalya into Shurpanakha, and also change the sets so that Ayodhya could become Janasthana. I made it clear to the players that they should leave out all crude language and explicit scenes in their presentation. They were unhappy but agreed. </P>
      <P>The play began as scheduled at nine at night; it was to go on till midnight. A dozen or so ‘Washington lights’ lit the stage with white light to make it appear moonlit. The princesses and their companions sat in a makeshift royal box, shielded from public view by a cloth screen with windows, waiting eagerly for the performance to begin. I was with the VIPs, the DC and other dignitaries and invited guests, seated on chairs and benches in front of the royal box. Puttey Gowda and his company stood with humility and devotion, ready to present the program for the evening. I briefly introduced them and gave directions for the performance to begin. </P>
      <P>The play went on smoothly. It was a professional performance by seasoned actors. As it went through well-known episodes – Sita’s marriage to Rama, Kaikeyi’s anger and Rama’s exile – with the usual fanfare of drums, trumpets and dances, there were no signs of either approval or boredom from the occupants of the royal box. Having been up since cock’s crow, I was so tired that I was only waiting for the program to end so I could go and catch a good night’s sleep. In fact, I would have been happy if the royal party were to decide that they had seen enough and stopped the program early. Suddenly, things became lively. </P>
      <P>The scene shifted to Janasthana. Rama and Lakshmana are seated in the forest, speaking to Sita in Yakshagana music. All of a sudden, the light turns red, and there is a burst of drums, trumpets, horns and a host of other instruments accompanied by shrieks as the Rakshasa princess Shurpanakha jumps on the stage – screaming and gesturing wildly. She has come to frighten Sita and seduce Rama. I don’t know how Sita felt, but I almost had a heart attack. I can only attempt to describe her terrible form as presented by the master actor of Puttey Gowda’s company. Her ears were decorated with square baskets the size of two hands, her nose with a large twig from a neem tree, and on her back she had a large basket used for raising silkworms. The most dreadful of all were her breasts – two huge pillows specially made for the occasion. </P>
      <P>As she made her entry, the music director gave a few resounding thumps on his large drum – thai, thai, thakkada-dim, tadakina-tom – and set the measure for her terrible dance. She leaped five feet into the air, twirling right and left, brandishing her huge breasts up and down as if trying to seduce heaven and earth. It was a grotesque sight – sure to outrage the delicate sensibilities of the princesses in the royal box. </P>
      <P>This was beyond my wildest imagination. I felt that Kantha Raje Urs would be equally unhappy about the turn of events.<SPAN><Sup>12 </Sup></SPAN>I saw all the good work going down the drain because of this one mishap. I got up with the intention of going to the stage, asking them to stop the performance and apologize for the offense. I saw Kantha Raje Urs sitting with an uncharacteristically glum face; he avoided my eyes. We were saved by the second surprise of the evening. As I got up, I heard applause and peals of laughter from the royal box. The Durbar Baxi, who had been summoned into the royal box came out and said, “The dance is wonderful! Please let it go on for another five minutes.” </P>
      <P>The players needed no more encouragement. The performance went on till midnight. After the play, Her Highness, through the Durbar Baxi, sent Puttey Gowda a gift of offerings and cash. The princesses were apparently not as delicate as we had imagined! </P>
      <P>On our way back from the performance, Kantha Raje Urs asked me if I had planned the whole thing. </P>
      <P>“Is it possible, sir?” I replied. “The sight of that Shurpanakha struck me like a bolt of lightning.” </P>
      <P>“Luck always seems to be on your side,” he said as he shrugged his shoulders. </P>
      <P>The Maharani had treated me throughout with utmost consideration. As she was about to return after completing her tour of the temples, Her Highness sent for me and said, “The last few days have been hectic. You must be very tired, doing so much to make our visit </P>
      <P>It should be noted that though the Queen Mother was his older sister, there was a certain formal distance between the two because of her high position and the fact that she had been ruling as Regent only seven years earlier (1894-1902). Kantha Raje Urs had served as her secretary during the regency. </P>
      <P>enjoyable. These four days were delightful. We don’t feel like going back. We are returning because our duty calls us back.” </P>
      <P>She offered me tambula;. I tried to say something appropriate but could think of nothing. Finally I just bowed to her with folded hands and said, “I am gratified that your visit here was pleasant. My devotion is great but my capacity is limited.” </P>
      <P>She and her party left. The DC patted me on the back and said that I had come through with flying colors – ‘in first class’, to use his own words. He too left in his car. By then I was so tired that I seemed to be in a trance. The compliments showered on me by palace officials sounded like dream music, passing from one ear through the other. The only sensation I had was a profound sense of relief that the whole thing was over. I just collapsed into a chair and had a smoke. </P>
      <P>A few days after the visit, I received notification from the Government transferring me to Pavagada as Amildar. Pavagada is a godforsaken taluk in a remote corner of the state. The DC Kantha Raje Urs was furious and demanded immediate revocation of the order. He said that there was a great deal that still remained to be done in the taluk, much of it half-done. He also wanted to know if the transfer was punishment for my excellent work in organizing the Maharani’s visit. He wrote a very strong letter objecting to the Government’s order. Kantha Raje Urs himself told me this. He said he would not release me from Narsipur without promotion. </P>
      <P>The order transferring me to Pavagada was cancelled. The Revenue Commissioner’s office (which reported to the Diwan) sent back a feeble excuse claiming that deteriorating conditions in Pavagada needed a highly capable officer. Drought and breakdown in law and order needed someone like me to restore normalcy, it claimed. As the Amildar with the best record in the state the Government wanted me to take charge. It was this need, and not any unhappiness over my performance that had brought forth the order, the letter claimed. </P>
      <P>“Then promote him,” Kantha Raje Urs retorted. He was already upset that I had been passed over for promotion in spite of his strong recommendation. This was too much. </P>
      <P>I read the whole thing differently. Because of my closeness to the palace, especially after my highly successful program during the Maharani’s visit, a high official who disliked me felt that I might use my influence to promote myself, or possibly even hurt him. I still believe that my interpretation was correct. <SPAN><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN></P>
      <P>A few months after this, V.P. Madhava Rao’s term as Diwan ended and Sir T. Ananda Rao was appointed in his place. During the next few months I conducted an elaborate survey of lands that had changed their areas and shapes due to river action like deposition of alluvial soil and erosion. It was extremely demanding work that had been pending for several years. It involved a detailed re-examination of hundreds of survey numbers and reallocation of land and revenues. After I completed my work of regularizing survey numbers and revenue records, I was promoted and transferred to Bangalore as registrar. It was the end of my service as Amildar. It is also a convenient point to end my memoir. I’ll next devote a few pages to a ‘looking back’ at those years. </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Appendix on the administrative effectiveness: Amildar as the pivot </strong>
      </P>
      <P>I have often reflected on the days when I was Amildar – the authority and the respect that officials like me commanded and the pride with which I was able to discharge my official duties. The real love and respect that the people had for the Amildar in those days is not enjoyed by the Amildar today – or by any official for that matter. I am not saying this out of any personal vanity; nor am I suggesting that it was because of my personal qualities as an individual. I believe that there were many other Amildars like me who had gained the respect and affection of the people. </P>
      <P>This has set me thinking about the causes behind that state of affairs </P>
      <P>– when people had complete trust in the Government, which they identified with the Amildar. In those days, all the authority and the responsibility connected with the running of a taluk were concentrated in the hands of the Amildar. In previous years, during the days of chaos, </P>
      <P>Of course it was correct. This ‘high official’, needless to say was Diwan V.P. Madhava Rao. The Diwan did not help himself with this extraordinarily petty act. Unhappiness was brewing in royal circles, and Madhava Rao was made to resign a few months later on a minor pretext. Rama Rao was soon promoted. </P>
      <P>the Amildar was essential for ensuring the wellbeing of the people as well as the authority of the rulers. <SPAN><Sup>14 </Sup></SPAN>In those days of poor communication, without the authority to enforce law and dispense justice in local hands, the result would have been anarchy. </P>
      <P>To the people, the Government meant the Amildar. The Amildar was the police chief; he had under his control, in addition to the police, thirty to forty staff members known as atavane kandachara.<SPAN><Sup>15 </Sup></SPAN>The Amildar was also the judge. So, swift and ready justice was available from the Amildar, like ‘water from the local river’. As a result, the Government to the people was something close and concrete, not remote and abstract. Justice obtained from a remote authority is like water brought from a deep well far away from home. The thirst resulting from the effort of drawing and bringing the water is enough to exhaust it. The Amildar in those days truly represented the Government for the people. He was always at hand to solve a problem or dispense justice. </P>
      <P>At the same time, the Amildar was also the representative of the people in the Government. Just as he was the Government for his taluk, he embodied the taluk as far as the Government was concerned. The state of communications being what it then was, higher officials were remote from most people; many did not even know who the Diwan or the Revenue Commissioner was.<SPAN><Sup>16 </Sup></SPAN>A good number had never seen even the deputy commissioner (DC). Since we did not have an elected government, we did not also have the influence, good or bad, of vote</P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>14 </Sup></SPAN>This ‘days of chaos’ refers to the period of near anarchy resulting from the arbitrary rule of Hyder and Tippu — especially the latter — when the long standing administrative system was uprooted by meaningless reforms like introducing Persian as the official language. This was followed by the thirty year rule of the young and inexperienced Krishna Raja III, who lacked the resources and the support (including British support) to restore order. The British Commission administered the state from 1831</P>
      <P>81. There is evidence to suggest that British agents undermined the Maharaja’s efforts to restore order after nearly forty years of chaos. So the ‘misrule’ which led to the removal of Maharaja Krishna Raja III had sources outside his control. </P>
      <P><SPAN><Sup>15 </Sup></SPAN>Sort of security and intelligence personnel not in police uniform. <SPAN><Sup>16 </Sup></SPAN>Everyone though knew who the Maharaja was. </P>
      <P>seekers. An Amildar of average competence would become familiar with his taluk within six months to a year. He would by then know the problems and strengths of each village in his taluk. So a conscientious Amildar would be in a position to fight for his people, representing their interests in the Government. He was the centre of gravity representing both the Government and the people with each other. In short, he was the pivot. </P>
      <P>This, I believe, was the secret behind the extraordinary effectiveness of the Mysore administration built around the Amildar.<SPAN><Sup>17 </Sup></SPAN>There is no need for me to detail the situation today. Government authority is more diffused and its centre of gravity has moved away from its local representative or the Amildar. And the Amildar also no longer represents the people. I do not know where the present situation will take us. When there is a total transformation of the Government, the lives of the people will not remain unaffected by it. Perhaps, the Amildar, who was the king’s representative, will eventually be replaced by a committee made up of people’s representatives. The Amildar may then become its chief executive. Who knows? </P>
      <P>I am optimistic about the future. Above everything, our people are brave and just. When the turmoil due to change subsides, I believe that a new system will evolve that will look after the welfare of our people and bring peace and prosperity to our land. </P>
      <P>May God bring peace and prosperity to all, and bring India fame and honor in this world. </P>
      <P>Sarve jana sukhino bhavantu – ‘May everyone in the world be happy!’ </P>
      <P>It was a system that had evolved over several centuries of history and tradition, and not something that could be copied overnight as some other princely states tried to do. The period of direct British rule (183181) left the authority and influence of the Amildar undisturbed, and may have even increased it due to the increased remoteness of British officials from the people. </P>
