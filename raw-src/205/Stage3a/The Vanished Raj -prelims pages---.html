          <P>RAJAJI ON RAMA RAO (1877 – 1960) </P>
          <P>C. Rajagopalachari </P>
          <P>Navaratna Rama Rao and I met in 1892 when we were both in our early teens in the Central College, Bangalore. I sought him out and left a letter in his room on the top of an eating house, asking for his friendship. Eating houses were of a wretched quality in those days and students who had no home in the city hired wretched rooms to sleep in and ate poor meals in what were called hotels which were as far from the hotels we know now as a twelve anna rush mat is from a Persian Carpet. My letter must have been a very boyish document. But in the romance of adolescence it was a serious adventure. I was attracted by his brains, his brightness, his lovable exterior, and by his being better read than all the rest of us in the college and as fond of great English literature as myself. Rama Rao accepted and we were friends from then on until death parted us on 27 November 1960 after sixty-eight years of unbroken attachment. We read a lot together—Byron, Shakespeare, Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thackeray, Dickens and many other classic authors’ books. He was the greater connoisseur of the two of us and his taste was superb and guided me like a mesmerist. We laughed and enjoyed humour and talked metaphysics and educated each other continuously. Our friendship was an astonishment and mystery to our college mates but they tolerated it and gathered round both of us in admiration. </P>
          <P>My boyish instinct was right and I am thankful for it. Our mutual affection made us nobler and better and stronger and happier than either of us would have been without it. We were each the external life of the other as Valmiki puts it in respect of Lakshmana for Sri Rama. All life is a mystery and I realize it more and more every day and as one after another of my friends and colleagues pass out and I am left with increasing loneliness. Life is a mystery but love is the greatest mystery of all. Dear young men and women who read this, do as we two did, Rama Rao and I. We swore to ourselves each in his own mind that we should be friends for all life. And so we were all these nearly seventy years, one soul in two bodies and two lives in each body. This kind of friendship will keep you from sin, from all kinds of meanness. It will protect you like a guardian angel, against all evil, all unhappiness, all stepping down from the ideals of romantic youth. </P>
          <P>Rama Rao’s life and mine ran on different tracks. What if? We were ever together, though others did not see it. Whatever each of us was doing and wherever we were, we were together in spirit. Pothen Joseph wrote last week “I know he is in deep mourning for a friend in Bangalore who had become a part of his own being.” That put it as briefly and truly as any English words can do it. Those who have not experienced true and full friendship must think it all nonsense. God bless them. </P>
          <P>I saw my friend under Death’s black shadow on the ninth of November. The poison had gone to his head. He smiled in recognition but he was above the region of pain and away from normal expression. He was in delirium, uttering high things about the affairs of the world, about truth, and about many other things all incoherently. It was heart-rending to watch his best and most admirable intellect involved in incoherence. I asked a daughterin-law of his who sat by his bed to sing a Purandaradasa Kirtana. She did it beautifully. My friend’s eyes glistened. He stopped speaking and weakly struggled to bring his palms together in prayer. He looked grateful and sank into worship and silence. Never did I feel so happy. </P>
          <P>The doctors gave up all hope and it was only a matter of a couple of days according to them. But he appeared to revive and astonished the medical men for a few days. Exactly a fortnight after I left him on the thirteenth of November to go to Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, I got a message when I was in Belgaum, that all was over. I made an all-night car journey from Belgaum to Bangalore and reached at dawn. But before that, the previous evening, my friend’s body had been according to ancient custom reduced to ashes and I could only walk round that cruel heap and make three perambulations for a last physical act of love. As the Isa Upanishad rishi sings “the breath has left to join the universal air and the body has turned into Bhasma,” “O mind,” as the rishi continues, “remember that only the works remain, only the works remain.” </P>
          <P>Om Krato smara Krtam smara </P>
          <P>Krato smara Krtam smara. </P>
          <P>And I returned from the cremation ground praying as the rishi did </P>
          <P>Agne naya supathaa raaye asmaan </P>
          <P>Visvaani, deva, vayunaani vidvaan </P>
          <P>O, Fire, thou who knowest all the paths, lead us in the right path, cleanse us and save us from sin, we entreat you over and over. </P>
          <P>By C. Rajagopalachari (1878 – 1972), in Swarajya, December 17, 1960. </P>

          <H3>Preface </H3>
          <P>In 1951, our grandfather Navaratna Rama Rao began publishing a series of episodes drawn from his experience as an official in the Government of the Maharaja of Mysore in the first decade of the century. They appeared in the Kannada literary magazine ‘Jeevana’ (Life) edited by his close friend and junior colleague Masti Venkatesha Iyengar – one of the leading figures of modern Kannada literature and a winner of the Gnanapeetha Award. When the cycle was complete in 1954, it was brought out in book form under the title ‘Kelavu Nenapugalu’ (‘Some Reminiscences’). It was immediately recognized as a modern Kannada classic. What we present here is an English version of this celebrated work under the title ‘The Vanished Raj’. It is a unique work in modern Indian literature by a remarkable man. The author and his work are discussed separately, so we shall only briefly recount our experience and motivation. </P>
          <P>The translation was begun by Rajeshwari Rao more than thirty years ago. As a sociologist, her interest was both literary and sociological. She moved to Australia in 1985, and sent the manuscript – somewhat less than half complete – to her brother Rajaram, living in the United States. Rajaram worked on it until 1992, but his own work in ancient history and history of science prevented him from completing it for several years. It was only in 1999, that he could find the time to complete it, though it still needed some work before it could go to the publisher. He then became preoccupied with his work on ancient India, relating to Vedic and Harappan civilizations, which delayed its publication for a few more years. He was able to complete the manuscript only in 2008. The result is the volume presented here. </P>

          <P>Our first note of gratitude goes to our late father Col N. Srinivasa Rao who suggested bringing out the English version. He also read the work in detail right through the translation and helped fill several gaps and made valuable suggestions. We remember with gratitude our eminent friend the late Dr. M.N. Srinivas who encouraged our work at every stage. Our cousin, the late Navaratna Narayana Murthy placed before us the results of his own extensive research into the origins of the Navaratna family and its name. Several of Rajaram’s American friends read the manuscript and offered helpful suggestions. Among these, Dr. Rosalie Wolfe (nee Nerheim) of Chicago and Dr. Jomana Amara of Houston (now at the Naval Postgraduate School) merit special mention. The beautiful jacket design was created by Prabal Media and Marketing under Mahesh Prabhu. To all these, we are grateful. Our debt to Rama Rao’s youngest son Navaratna Lakshman is especially great for keeping the Kannada version is continued publication without which the present work would have been impossible. </P>

          <H3>Introduction </H3>
          <P>Navaratna Rama Rao is remembered today chiefly as C. Rajagopalachari's closest friend and his collaborator in the popular English versions of the ‘Ramayana’ and the ‘Mahabharata’. He was, however, an important figure in his own right – a high official and influential cultural figure in the princely state of Mysore in the first half of this century. He was a visionary and an administrator of exceptional ability who was mainly responsible for establishing the silk industry in Mysore on a firm footing, making it the leading revenue producer and the largest private employer in the state. It became the model for Central Silk Board established by Government of India and served as its first Vice Chairman (with the Industries Minister Shyam Prasad Mukherji as Chairman, ex-officio.) The present state of Karnataka continues to benefit from his work by being the largest producer of silk in the country. He was one of the officials of the kind who brought Mysore the reputation of being the “model state”. Rulers of other princely states used to send their princes and promising officials to Mysore in an attempt to emulate its </P>
          <P>excellence.<SPAN><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P>
          <P>It was not an easy thing to copy, built as it was on a system of trust and decentralized authority that had evolved over five centuries of history and tradition. The other princely states ended up copying some of its superficial features. </P>
          <P>While this by itself is sufficient to secure for him a place in history, his reputation today rests on his literary work, notably his great memoir – ‘Kelavu Nenapugalu’ ("Some Remeniscences"). Written in Kannada, it chronicles his experiences as a young official in the Maharaja's government in the first decade of the twentieth century. There is of course no shortage of memoirs written about the Raj, but Navaratna Rama Rao's Memoir is unique in several respects. Though written in a state ruled by a Maharaja, it is a work about the common people and their daily life, rather than a record of the deeds and misdeeds of princes and potentates; even when a prince or a Diwan puts in an appearance, he is only incidental to the story. No less interestingly, it was written about the people of Mysore by a man who was one of them </P>
          <P>– whom the people loved and trusted, and who in turn loved and trusted them. His readers too were fellow Mysoreans, of a later generation to be sure, but sharing the same history and traditions. They were his people; he was one of them. As a result, what we find in his writing is involvement, not detachment. This has made it a valuable source for sociologists and other scholars, though that was not his intention. Above all, it is a hugely entertaining work which has never lost its popularity in the fifty years since its appearance. It has been compared to Axel Munthe’s famous ‘Story of San Michel’, but Rama Rao’s work is distinguished by an intimacy and involvement that are not found in Munthe’s work; the range of characters and events chronicled is also much wider. In a sense it is less a personal memoir than an unusually vivid chronicle of an era that has disappeared forever. </P>
          <P>To go with this, he was the friend, mentor, and sometimes patron of important literary and artistic figures of the period. They included such distinguished writers as Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, D.V. Gundappa, A.N. Krishna Rao, K.M. Munshi, C. Rajagopalachari himself as well as musicians like Veena Seshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Tiger Varadachar, T. Chowdiah, M.S. Subbu Lakshmi and many others of distinction. Masti, in particular, regarded him as his teacher. Rama Rao was widely read in English, Kannada, Sanskrit, and French. He had published articles on Shakespeare and was recognized as an authority the world over. He was also an accomplished amateur violinist. To cap it all, while serving as Amildar of T. Narsipur, he led an archaeological expedition that resulted in the restoration of five ancient temples. Even this, he approached not as an antiquarian, but as a Hindu to whom the restoration of these temples was part of a living tradition. All in all, he was a true figure of the Indian Renaissance, whose study of Western literature and culture left a mark on his own work, and on India. His work with Rajaji on the two great Indian epics is sufficient testimony to the fact. </P>
          <P>What we have presented here is a retelling of </P>
          <P>his Memoir in English. We call it a retelling </P>
          <P>rather than translation because we have found it necessary to selectively reorganize the original work. A straight translation presents significant linguistic, historical, and structural problems. A substantial part of the book is conversational in style and content in which the author reproduces the various dialects and accents then prevailing in Kannada. This makes it a valuable source for students of social history, but also impossible to reproduce in English. Next, his work was begun in 1951 – or less than five years after the disappearance of the Raj and Princely Rule. The titular Maharaja was still a beloved figure and the administration and the society not notably different from the time when he was still ruling. He could, therefore, assume on the part of his readers knowledge of the social and political conditions of the era that we today cannot. Finally, his Memoir appeared as a series of articles in the now defunct literary magazine Jeevana, which made it somewhat disjointed in structure; it also contains some material that is of little interest today. Taking these into consideration, we have introduced some structural changes and occasional explanations where necessary, always making them as unobtrusive as possible. </P>
          <P>Navaratna Rama Rao’s Memoir covers his experiences during the period from 1904 to 1909, with forays into earlier and later periods. As just noted it is not so much an autobiography as a record of events and personalities that he encountered and dealt with. For this reason, in the present retelling, we have organized it into chapters that highlight events and personalities. This has been supplemented wherever necessary by administrative and other details of Mysore that were familiar to readers when these stories first appeared, but not to most readers today. </P>
          <P>In addition, Rajaram was extremely close to Rama Rao in the last years of his life, which allowed him to gather numerous details about events and personalities that were left out in the original. He heard the same stories told and retold in more detail and with less reserve. (We have on occasion used some other sources including his biography by Masti and records and recollections of his friends and family members, especially Rama Rao’s eldest son Srinivasa Rao.) These have been included wherever found suitable. We would like to point out however, that these only highlight a few minor aspects of the story in question without changing anything of substance. </P>
          <P>Though studied by scholars today for its sociological interest, it was written mainly to be enjoyed, for Rama Rao was a wonderful storyteller. And this is the spirit that we have tried to bring to our translation also. If it turns out to be of historical and sociological interest, well, it is purely incidental. We will consider our retelling a success if it proves to be enjoyable reading. </P>

              <strong>The Author </strong>
            </H5>
            <P>Navaratna Rama Rao was born in the city of Mysore on May 27, 1877. His father was Navaratna Balakrishna Rao, an ‘overseer’ (of public works) in the state government. His mother was Brahmani Bai of Kallambilla. Though limited by the educational opportunities then available, Balakrishna Rao (c.1839–1925) was a man of ability. He supervised the construction of the reservoir in Hesaragatta near Bangalore which, for many years, was the main source of drinking water for the city. He was responsible also for the planning and construction of the posh residential area in Mysore known as Chamarajapuram. A road in Chamarajapuram is named after him. </P>
            <P>Rama Rao came from a Vedic Madhva-Deshasta Brahmin family of some distinction. The family name Navaratna means ‘nine jewels’ – obviously a title. There has been much speculation about its origin, some of it quite fanciful. But recent research by our cousin the late Navaratna Narayana Murthy has settled the question. It was awarded in 1638 to one Purushottamacharya and his seven brothers and a nephew for their scholarly services to the seer of Uttaradhi Mutt – a Madhva institution. Their descendants have used the title as the family name since 1638. </P>
            <P>Shortly thereafter, some members of the Navaratna clan accompanied Shahaji (father of the famous Shivaji) when he was appointed governor of Karnataka by the Bijapur Sultan. Shahaji settled some of them at a place near Bangalore that is still known as Navaratna Agrahara. (Another branch settled in Savanur near Shimoga.) In 1689, Bangalore and the surrounding areas came under the rule of Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar, the Raja of Mysore. For the next two-and-ahalf centuries, members of the Navaratna family were subjects of the Mysore rulers, with several of them attaining distinction as scholars and administrators. Today, there are probably two hundred individuals who go by the Navaratna name, living mainly in Karnataka and Maharashtra. A few members of the clan are living in the United States and Australia. Several of them have attained distinction as professionals, scholars, and writers. <SPAN><Sup>2 </Sup></SPAN></P>
            <P>Navaratna Rama Rao attended school in Mysore and Bangalore, graduating with a degree in science from the Central College, probably in 1899. His closest friend was C. Rajagopalachari, later known as Rajaji who became a leading figure of the national movement and the first Indian Governor General of Independent India. The greatest influence on Rama Rao was John Guthrie Tait (1861 – 1945) who taught English and history at the Central College. In spite of the large age difference between the two men, they became close friends. In addition to their love of English literature, a common bond was their love of the outdoors. Their close association and friendship left an unusual mark: Rama Rao spoke English with a Scottish accent! </P>
            <P>John Tait came from an illustrious Scottish family. His father was Peter Guthrie Tait, a leading British mathematician and colleague of such luminaries as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Raleigh, William Rowan Hamilton and others. While not in their league as a scientist, Tait was an important mathematician whose invention of ‘Quaternion’s’ paved the </P>
            <P>The two main branches Navaratna clan are the Savanur branch and the Devanahalli branch. Before Rama Rao attained distinction, the Savanur branch was regarded the more distinguished. One of its members, Satyadharma Tirtha, a contemporary of Diwan Purniya, became a greatly revered head of the Madhva Uttaradhi Mutt. His samadhi at Kudali (near Shimoga) is a place of pilgrimage. </P>
            <P>way for the important field of mathematics known as ‘Vector Analysis’. John’s brother Frederick was an outstanding golfer, good enough to win the British Amateur title twice. John Tait was himself a man of distinction who influenced two generations of Mysoreans. He retired from the Central College in 1920 and returned to his native Edinburgh where he spent the rest of his life. It is a pity that no biography of him appears to have been written. </P>
            <P>Tait has left what is probably the earliest recorded account of Rama Rao. In a letter he wrote to Rama Rao’s biographer Masti Venkatesha Iyengar in March 1925, he recalled Rama Rao as a youngster some thirty-five years earlier: </P>
            <P>My first memories of Navaratna Rama Rao are of a little chubby boy who used to come and look on at cricket matches. He was then in the London Mission High School (in Bangalore), and unknown to me, but I noticed that he was surrounded by a crowd of listeners to whom he discoursed with amazing volubility in Kannada and kept them in a state of great hilariousness and no doubt edified them as well. </P>
            <P>Rama Rao owed much to Tait for his interest in literature. On more than one occasion he spoke of Tait as “next only to God.” In 1930, when he was in England as a member of the Indian delegation to the Round Table Conference, he found time in the midst of a hectic schedule to visit Tait then living in retirement in Edinburgh. The high regard in which Rama Rao still held his old teacher is evident from the following letter which he wrote to Masti Venkatesha Iyengar soon after visiting Tait. (Letter dated 2 November 1930, cited in Masti’s biography of Rama Rao): </P>
            <P>I came here last night in fulfillment of a pilgrimage long overdue, and was met by our old master at the Railway Station which is not inappropriately named the Waverly Station. We dined together, and I was with him till nigh midnight. I write this letter while waiting for him this morning, for he has promised to come to take me round places of interest in Edinburgh. I have seen what I mainly came to see and whatever else there is can be but the background to the principal thing in the picture. … </P>
            <P>He has mellowed with age, and he has aged more than I had expected. [Tait had retired and left India in 1920.] There is a slight stoop in his shoulders. O time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing, but in all else he is the same as before, except perhaps that he is less cynical. His eldest boy is at Cambridge in St Peter’s [Sic: Peterhouse], being the third generation of his name to go there. </P>
            <P>Following his graduation from the Central College, Rama Rao went to Madras to study law. He and Rajagopalachari were again classmates in the Law College, and also shared lodgings. After receiving his law degree in 1902, he went to Salem where his friend Rajaji was already practising, and set up his own law practice.<SPAN><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN>(He was an independent lawyer and not Rajaji's junior as stated by Rajmohan Gandhi in his biography of Rajaji. He appeared in cases both with and against Rajaji.) </P>
            <P>While they remained close friends, their paths soon diverged. Rama Rao returned to Mysore to join the Maharaja's government, while Rajaji went on to become a leading figure in Mahatma Gandhi's national movement. Rama Rao had a flourishing practice in Salem, but he chose to return to Mysore apparently at his wife’s insistence. He himself records that the climate of Salem – hot and humid round the year – did not suit his wife’s health. Within a short time of joining the Maharaja’s government, he gained recognition as an exceptionally able administrator and visionary planner. Although he failed to place high enough in the Mysore Civil Service examination – due to his having offended one of the examiners – he rose to be the head of a department in the state administration. A few others rose higher only to be forgotten by history. </P>
            <P>Had he placed third instead of fourth in the examination he might have begun his career as an assistant commissioner – equivalent to a deputy collector in the British ruled provinces. Instead, he began as revenue probationer in 1904. About a year later he was appointed Amildar or the chief of a taluk (county). This officer is now called a Tehsildar. But the comparison ends here. The kind of authority and dignity that an Amildar like Rama Rao commanded in Princely Mysore (Old Mysore) is not even approximated by a modern Tehsildar. A Tehsildar today is little more than a lackey of local politicians; an Amildar </P>
            <P>His graduation certificate was with his eldest son Srinivasa Rao and is now with his grandson Rajaram. </P>
            <P>In the 1950s, Rajaram accompanied Navaratna Rama Rao on a visit to Narsipur. At the Laxminarayan temple, scores of people including a few who had seen Rama Rao more than forty years ago had gathered to catch a sight of the famous man. The temple priest told everyone assembled, how, his late father, whenever there was any hint of injustice used to proclaim: “These are not the days of Navaratna Rama Rao.” </P>
            <P>in Old Mysore was a ruler, a representative of the Maharaja, who commanded the respect, affection, and dignity growing out of five centuries of tradition and history. And the government too took care to see that the dignity of the position was maintained; in turn, the government expected the Amildar to conduct himself in a manner worthy of the people’s trust and respect. </P>
            <P>Rama Rao served as Amildar from early 1905 to 1909, first in Yedatore, and later in Narsipur, both in the Mysore District. In these areas, especially in Narsipur, he is still a legend. The main part of his Memoir covers his experiences during those five years. His position as Amildar brought him into daily contact with people from all walks of life </P>
            <P>– from the humblest to the highest in the land. It was a feature of Princely Mysore that every man and woman believed that one could get justice from the Maharaja through the Amildar. It was the lives of these people that he chronicled. Had he begun his career as assistant commissioner, he would probably not have enjoyed this closeness with the people. Nor would we today have his Memoir. </P>
            <P>His career followed an unusual course. He was promoted in 1909, and by 1912 or so he was in line to become deputy commissioner (collector). At the time he was on the staff of an office known as the Economic Conference as the head of its agricultural section. He found that silk rearing, which was practiced as a cottage industry in the state, had great economic and employment potential. Developing this, however, would require the concentrated attention of a dedicated official who would be willing to place the interests of the industry ahead of his career. After much soul searching, the thirty-five-year old Navaratna Rama Rao submitted a plan to the Government recommending the establishment of a Department of Sericulture. </P>
            <P>It was an audacious move for such a young official, but apparently there were people in the Government willing to listen to him. The most <SPAN>helpful and sympathetic of them was his senior friend Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs, the Maharaja’s uncle and the chairman of the Economic Conference. He had been Rama Rao’s superior officer earlier, and had great respect and even admiration for the young man’s talents. Once he learnt of the plan, even the Diwan, the famous Sir M. Visveshwaraya, supported him.<SPAN><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN>The seemingly impossible then happened. A new Department of Sericulture was created with the young Rama Rao as its Superintendent, later promoted Director. When the necessary allowance is made for the support of influential friends like Kantha Raje Urs, Rama Rao must have commanded respect at the highest levels to make this possible. </SPAN></P>
            <P>The Government had no reason to regret its decision. Rama Rao devoted twelve years to building up the Department of Sericulture to the point where it became the most profitable industry in the state and its largest employer. He faced much hostile criticism and even ridicule. “Rama Rao must have learnt silk-making in law school” was a common joke circulating in those days. But discerning colleagues and officials recognized his achievement. The late M.A. Srinivasan, a distinguished statesman and a man of vast administrative experience who had served under Rama Rao, said that he “revolutionized the silk industry.” What Rama Rao did was to streamline and integrate all aspects of the silk industry – from research to production and distribution – so the whole thing worked as a coordinated unit. He used basic principles of what we now call ‘Operations Research’, except the field did not then exist. </P>
            <P>It was a major achievement but it came at a cost. It looked as though in the process of building up the silk industry he had sacrificed his career. As late as 1925, he was Director of Sericulture, with the rank equivalent of a senior deputy commissioner. He was reconciled to spending the rest of his career as Director, while younger and less able individuals moved up in the ranks. But in 1926 he was called to the Secretariat as Development Secretary, or ‘Secretary to the Government’ as it was more often known. He later went to England with the Maharaja’s delegation (headed by the Diwan and the Yuvaraja or </P>
            <P>It should be recorded that Rama Rao was not one of Vishveshwaraya’s staunch admirers. They had basic differences over economic and industrial policy. </P>
            <P>the Crown Prince) for the First Round Table Conference. He retired in 1933 as Director of Industries and Commerce, but remained active as an advisor to various organizations and as member of the board of several industries.<SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>He was also frequently consulted by the Government. Above all he became a major cultural figure. </P>
            <P>It is a moot question today whether he would have risen higher in the Government – possibly to the position of Diwan – had he been successful in the civil service examination. After his retirement in 1933, he was not lacking in offers of high positions – including the possibility of Diwan – from several princely states. Apparently he was not interested. After Indian independence in 1947, at Rajaji’s prodding, he accepted the position of Vice Chairman of the newly established Central Silk Board; there was after all no one better qualified.<SPAN><Sup>6</Sup></SPAN> He did not like living in Delhi, but the Indian Government accommodated him by moving the office to Bangalore. Nonetheless, he soon resigned. Apparently, he was no longer interested and wanted to spend more time with his family. He was well past seventy by then. He died on November 29, 1960. His close friend Rajagopalachari outlived him by more than twelve years. </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Literary figure </strong>
            </P>
            <P>As a literary figure, Rama Rao occupies an unusual position. In his lifetime, he was greatly admired for his mastery of English and knowledge of English literature. He was an acknowledged authority on </P>
            <P>7</P>
            <P>Shakespeare, consulted by scholars worldwide. He wrote frequently in English, mostly on topics of the day. As a teenager, he had also published a novel in English. None of this has survived. His best known works in English are the Mahabharata and the Ramayana of C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. It is not widely known </P>
            <P>– Rama Rao refused to take credit for it – that the so-called ‘Rajaji Mahabharata’ was extensively revised and almost completely rewritten </P>
            <P><SPAN><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN>He turned down the Government’s offer of extension of service. </P>
            <P><SPAN><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN>The Chairman (ex-officio) was Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, Minister for Industries. </P>
            <P><SPAN><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN>Both Masti and D.V. Gundappa consulted him during their well-known Kannada translations of Shakespeare. Rama Rao wrote the Foreword to Masti’s Hamlet. </P>
            <P>by Rama Rao when it came out in the second edition. Rajaji himself acknowledges the debt: “It is as much his as mine,” wrote Rajaji in the Preface to the second edition. (Rama Rao received a share of the royalties, but refused to have his name added as co-author.) With more than three million having read the Mahabharata alone, these are probably the two most widely read books in English written by an Indian writer, making Rama Rao (along with Rajagopalachari) the most widely read Indian author in English. (The Mahabharata is believed to have been read by nearly four million people.) </P>
            <P>In Kannada, a language he neglected as a youth, he wrote only one book and a small volume of short stories. On the strength of these, he is recognized as a master and a pioneer. “Navaratna Rama Rao’s literary output in Kannada is small in bulk,” wrote a leading critic, “but what he wrote is writ in pure gold.” His influence on modern Kannada literature is out of proportion to the size of his output. Much of his influence was through personal contact and friendship and lectures. He was a superb conversationalist who had many memorable stories. In addition, he generously gave away ideas for stories to be written by others. The best known of these is the longish story ‘Subbanna’ by Masti – arguably the most famous short story in modern Kannada. No one who ever met him could forget him. The eminent Kannada novelist A.N. Krishna Rao compared him to Samuel Johnson. </P>
            <P>When it came to scholarship per se, Rama Rao’s knowledge of Kannada was not on the same level as his English, but he had a great natural gift for the language that transcended the limits of grammar and syntax and opened new horizons for other writers. The narrative powers and the vivid imagery that distinguish his Kannada works – especially in his Memoir – are not found in his English writing; the latter, while never lacking in distinction, did not have the creative sparkle of his Kannada that lifted it to the level of genius. He often said that he wrote Kannada with his youngest daughter and granddaughters in mind. Towards the end of his life, in a radio talk, he described his views as a writer in the two languages (translated from the Kannada original): </P>
            <P>In my youth, at home, I was used to hearing both Kannada and Marathi being spoken. Since a majority of my relatives spoke Kannada, I can say that it was my mother tongue. </P>
            <P>Right from the beginning, I wanted to learn English well and impress everyone, including the English, with my mastery of the language and be praised for it. I had no great love for Kannada at the time. Even after I joined high school and college, I habitually cut Kannada classes. I passed the Kannada paper in B.A. only on the strength of my translation. </P>
            <P>I always had great love for the English language and literature. I began my study of English in high school. When in college, I had a reputation among my colleagues and teachers as being outstanding in English. I always performed well in exams. Even while a student, one of my English novels had been published by the Christian College Magazine to the admiration of my teachers and critics. When I was in Law College, I used to make money by writing articles on various subjects for several English language publications. This helped with some of my college expenses. When I joined the service I was already famous for my English. A great deal of the government correspondence was in Kannada, but what I used was colloquial Kannada mixed with Urdu [and Marathi]. </P>
            <P>My experience as a government official brought me into contact with people from all walks of life. If we want to understand our people, and reach them, we must speak to them in the mother tongue. This became clear to me. </P>
            <P>Later, I had to speak frequently in the State Legislature, first as a government member, and then as an elected representative. This experience cleared my mind of all doubts I had about the adequacy of the Kannada language or its vocabulary. I gradually came to realize that if one’s thoughts are clear, Kannada language is no barrier to expressing them. </P>
            <P>As time passed, when someone, especially one of my close friends, praised anything I had written or spoken in Kannada, it gave me far greater pleasure than being praised for my English. I decided that as far as possible I would do my writing in Kannada. But I was faced with a question: what style to follow? I am not widely read in Kannada. [Sic: Relatively speaking. He knew the classics and also wrote scholarly articles. NSR] Also, highly ‘literary’ Kannada leaves most readers cold. I didn’t think it was proper to mix too much Sanskrit. My goal is to write the kind of language that our people use. </P>
            <P>For beauty of style, my ideal is the Kannada spoken by intelligent women in our cultured households. As far as I am concerned, any words or usages that appear in daily discourse are also part of Kannada regardless of their origin. For a live language to grow, should it not like a healthy animal acquire and digest food from outside? [He often said he wrote in a style so his youngest daughter and grandchildren could understand.] </P>
            <P>This represents my philosophy and my goals. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that my countrymen have accepted my writings in the same spirit. This fills me with gratitude towards my readers. </P>
            <P>It should be clear from all this that Rama Rao’s writing reflected his joyful nature and zest for life – qualities that show through every page of his Memoir. </P>
            <P>His Memoir was highly influential and soon had many imitators. But no one has come close to matching him either in human interest, wit or spontaneity. Many of them were his superiors when it came to Kannada scholarship, but he wrote better than most of them. To begin with, few had his experience at that crucial and fascinating period in history. In addition, he had a sense of history, personally knew historic personages, had participated in historic events, but never took himself too seriously. Gifted with an irrepressible sense of humor, he always had the capacity to laugh at himself. Every generation seems to discover the work anew, and new reviews keep appearing all the time. All in all, he was the right man at the right place at the right time that happened to capture the spirit of the time and left a work for future generations to enjoy. </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Appendix: Early influences – Tait and Rajagopalachari </strong>
            </P>
            <P>Rama Rao often mentioned his Central College Professor John Guthrie Tait and classmate C. Rajagopalachari as the two men to whom he was most indebted for his growth from a provincial youth steeped in tradition and orthodoxy into the Renaissance man that he became. But it was Tait far more than Rajagoplachari who was responsible for this transformation: the latter came from a background similar to Ram Rao’s </P>
            <P>– a traditional South Indian Brahmin family that he would never fully escape; he could not have opened the vistas that broadened horizons to the extent Tait did. Rama Rao made his debt to Tait explicit in a talk he gave at his old Alma Mater, the Bangalore Central College on June 7, 1952. </P>
            <P>Of all the dear and honored names I have mentioned, I would, this evening, select for a few words one which is to me personally sacred– that of my revered Master, Tait. I owe to him–next to God and to my beloved parents–all that has made my life worth living; but that is not the only, nor even the main, reason why I would speak of him this evening. He has a great claim on the gratitude of this college and this country. He spent thirty years of the best part of his life here, and gave without stint himself and his unsurpassed talents to the service of this College; and he left it as high in prestige as the proudest in India– great in learning and culture, great in sport and sportsmanship. He implanted in us not only a love of learning but also a code of honor and duty. </P>
            <P>To me no college celebration is complete without a tribute of gratitude to him. There were people who thought him hard and cynical, but that was only the conventional crust of the Britisher which hides warmth of heart. He also made no concealment of his faith in the inherent superiority of the White Man, but that was the fault of the conservative creed of his day, and with him it admitted of large and generous exceptions in favor of his students, and of Indians he really knew. I have lived longer than the ordinary span of human life, and met and known some great and famous men. But, I don’t think I have met or known one with a nobler, manlier heart or a more virile understanding. </P>
            <P>The point Rama Rao makes about Tait’s firm faith in the superiority of the White Man is interesting; it was a belief that he discarded once a personal relationship based on trust and mutual respect was established. So it was not racial prejudice but a sense of the cultural superiority of the ‘White’ meaning Western civilization. Tait was not alone in this attitude. Louis Benjamin Rice, who founded the Mysore Archaeology Department and published the famous Epigraphica Carnatica with thousands of inscriptions, also trained numerous Indian assistants. Rice freely acknowledged that some of his juniors (like Narasimhachar) surpassed him and took much pleasure in their achievements. Anyone who has been a teacher and guide, especially at the postgraduate level will understand the feeling. Enlightened, educated Britishers like Tait firmly believed it was their sacred duty to educate Indians who represented a once great but now degraded civilization and help them rise to their true potential. It is worth taking a look at this remarkable man. </P>
            <P>John Guthrie Tait (1861 – 1945) came from an illustrious Scottish family. In some ways John is the least famous of the three men from the Tait family whose names have survived in history. His father Peter Guthrie Tait (1831 – 1901) was a leading mathematical physicist of the time. He collaborated with such greats as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and William Rowan Hamilton. While not rising to their level as a scientist, P.G. Tait was a highly respected teacher and author of several important works on mathematical physics. John’s younger brother Frederick was twice British Amateur golf champion (1896, 98) and came close to winning it a third time before losing to John Ball in the finals in 1899. Frederick Tait went on to graduate from the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy and was posted in South Africa where he is believed to have introduced golf and founded the first golf club in the country. He seemed destined for greatness but his promising career was cut short when he was killed in action at Koodoosberg during the Second Boer War. </P>
            <P>In addition to education, what brought Tait and Rama Rao together was their interest in sports. Tait was an avid sportsman who had played </P>
            <P>Indian education owes much to people like Tait and Rice. Even the much maligned Thomas Babbington Macaulay who introduced English education in India had an enlightened streak. When cautioned that ideas he was introducing might one day make Indians demand constitutional rights and even freedom, Macaulay retorted – “It will be our proudest day.” (Just contrast this with the record of the centuries of alien rule prior to it that plunged India into a Dark Age from which it is only now coming out.) </P>
            <P>It would be wrong to dismiss it as racial prejudice and ignore the real contribution of pioneers like Tait and Rice. Tait in particular came from a distinguished and affluent family and was not one of those adventurers in search of a quick fortune. (The latter breed is not unknown today, sometimes at the highest levels. It is never mentioned that unlike the British these neo-colonialists have contributed nothing to education, science or culture which even the Soviets did.) </P>
            <P>Swami Vivekananda put it pithily: “Serve man to serve God.” </P>
            <P>
              <strong>John Tait (1861 - 1945), Keen Sportsman </strong>
            </P>
            <P>Rugby for Cambridge and Scotland. He was also a dedicated golfer though nowhere near as proficient as his younger brother Frederick. As Rama Rao recounted with self-deprecating humor: “As a youngster my grave self-dedication to the game [cricket] was what brought me to Mr. Tait’s notice, by amusing him greatly. On the rare occasions on which I hit a ball hard, he used to clap his hands with humorous enthusiasm and shout ‘Hip, Hip, Hurray! Three cheers for Navaratnam!’ He knew and liked me as a cricket enthusiast before I did anything worth his notice at my studies, and, though I haven’t done so badly at the latter, I get greater joy out of the memory of my undistinguished cricket deeds.” </P>
            <P>It should be noted that his self-deprecation notwithstanding, Rama Rao was himself an excellent athlete, particularly outstanding in wrestling in which he was close to professional level. It is a matter of satisfaction that Tait lived long enough (1945) to see his favorite students Rama Rao and Rajagopalachari rise to eminence. He was particularly happy when Rama Rao’s eldest son Srinivasa Rao enlisted during World War II. Though Indian by birth, he was given a King’s Commission instead of the Viceroy’s Commission as was usual with Indians. He was also assigned as medical officer to the Gurkha Regiment </P>
            <P>– an honor rarely given to Indian recruits. It cannot be confirmed but it is possible that Tait had a hand in this unusual assignment: Tait had served as a lieutenant colonel in World War I and might have put in a word. (Srinivasa Rao was a British national until he returned to India from medical studies in England in 1949 and took up Indian citizenship. Things were a bit fluid then with India having gained independence only two years before.) </P>
            <P>With Rama Rao’s other great friendship, with Rajagopalachari (Rajaji or CR) we find ourselves in the strange situation of having many more sources of knowledge but less clearly discernible influence. Several family members still living (including Rajaram) knew them both personally and had the opportunity to observe them close. Whenever he visited Bangalore or Mysore, even while serving as India’s Governor General, Rajaji stayed as Rama Rao’s guest at his home. Based on this observation it may safely be said that Tait’s influence on Rama Rao greatly exceeded Rajaji’s. While their friendship endured, their paths diverged. Rajaji became a Congressman and follower of Mahatma Gandhi while Rama Rao was and remained an anglophile all through his life. (So was Rajaji but in a more superficial way, definitely not his lifestyle.) Late in life Rama Rao believed India would one day emerge as a great power but disapproved of the Gandhian path which he saw as a futile attempt to return to an imagined past. He felt that India should build on what it had inherited from the British supplemented by India’s own cultural and social foundations. </P>
            <P>Rama Rao disapproved also of Rajaji’s leadership of the conservative Swatantra Party which he saw as elitist and reactionary and out of touch with the needs and aspirations of the common people. Rama Rao’s long years of service had given him insight into this aspect while Rajaji had gone directly from law practice into the Freedom Movement and tended to work better with ideas than with people. He had no mass following but was respected for his intelligence and sharp analytical mind. He was a brilliant administrator but so was Rama Rao. Their strong bond of friendship rested on shared values, interests and culture. They were both devout but by no means orthodox Hindus. Both believed in reform – and Rama Rao later married a woman from a different (non-Brahmin) community. Their shared experience found expression mainly in their literary work, especially their translations of the two great Indian epics. While Tait and Rama Rao had similar personalities, it was noticeably different from Rajagopalachari’s. </P>
            <P>For those observing the two men it appeared that the friendship was of greater significance to Rajagopalachari than to Rama Rao. This could be because of the very different lives they led. Rama Rao had a stable career and family life always surrounded by friends and family. Rajaji’s life was frequently interrupted by his political activities and imprisonments due to his participation in the Freedom Movement. He lost his wife early (1916) and unlike Rama Rao did not remarry. But there was more. While not cold as some thought, he lacked Rama Rao’s natural spontaneity and warmth that attracted friends from all strata of society. Where people loved Rama Rao, they admired Rajaji— his intellect, logic and above all his uncompromisingly sharp analytical mind. This is not a nature that is conducive to forming friendships. Anyway, here is what Rama Rao had to say in 1952 about Rajaji and their friendship of six decades. It is interesting to compare it with what Rajaji wrote in his obituary of Rama Rao reproduced earlier: </P>
            <P>When I try to tell you something about Sri C. Rajagopalachari, I feel strangely troubled. I have known him intimately these sixty years and more; yet every time I see him, I see in him traits I had not noticed before. I have felt the same in rereading my favourite plays in Shakespeare, and I attribute it to a maturing of my own perception by experience. It may be so in the other case also, but it is more probably due to the gradual unfolding of C. Rajagopalachari’s natural gifts under the stimulus of opportunity and a demand for their exercise. </P>
            <P>Together we lived in Bangalore and Madras, reading the same books, thinking the same thoughts, dreaming the same dreams, eating the same wretched food in the hotels of those days, living in the same dingy rooms, and as far as possible spending our holidays with one another. We had mapped our future to practice at the same Bar, and accordingly after taking my Law Degree I went to Salem where he was waiting for me. After about a couple of years there, our ways parted. I gravitated to Mysore and the Civil Service, and he went on, with singleness of aim, following faithfully the light that led him,… He accepted glory without exultation as he had gone to jail without plaint or repining. Elevated to a position never held by an Indian before [of Governor General], and in the midst of the almost barbaric gorgeousness of a Government House, which had been designed to gratify the vainglory of foreign satraps, he remained unaffected and unchanged… </P>
            <P>His Excellency K. M. Munshi calls him one of the greatest of living Indians, and hardly any will contradict him. I have as I have told you, known him long and closely, and ordinarily such intimacy is not conducive to hero-worship. Yet, he has seemed to me one of those philosopher-statesmen that our country has produced in times of crisis </P>
            <P>– Kautilya, Vidyaranya, Vyasa Raya, Mahatma Gandhi. He has a strong, disciplined intellect which can pierce to the very heart of a tangled problem and find a statesmanlike solution where ordinary minds would be mazed with mere details. Most of us have heard him speak and know how he can hold and convince his audience. </P>
            <P>He is one of the most versatile men I know. If he had not dedicated himself to politics, he might have been a great jurist or a distinguished literary man. As it is, in the scanty leisure of a crowded life, he has produced works in Tamil and English which his countrymen will long read and admire. Perhaps the most important constituent of C. R’s greatness is his utter fearlessness when he sees his duty clear before him. This Courage has its spring in his deeply religious nature. Religion with him is by no means doxy or dogma. It is Faith in God and Dharma. </P>
            <P>Rama Rao closed his tribute by quoting Wordsworth’s famous poem. “To my mind, he is the Happy Warrior </P>
            <P>“Who hath wrought Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought: Who, if he rise to station of command, Rises by open means, and there will stand On honourable terms, or else retire; </P>
            <P>Or if an unexpected call succeed, Come when it will, is equal to the need; Who, lifted high Or left unthought-of in obscurity, Plays, in the many games of life, that one Where that which he most values may be won.” </P>
            <P>To this tribute – and to the one Rajaji wrote for his friend, we only say ‘Amen’ and pray may India produce many more like them. </P>
