		<p>It was early seventies of the preceding century when I rolled out as a fresh product from a professional institute. I got an interview call from one of the best public sector undertakings in India. I was really excited. I attended the interview. It was going well. I was on top of my performance when a member with murky looks asked.</p>
		<p>“What are the functions of a personnel officer in an industrial organization like ours?”</p>
		<p>“Motivation, team building, morale building…,” but he interrupted me in a to nip in the bud sort, to say!</p>
		<p>“Don’t teach me your bookish knowledge. We want our people to know their job first.”</p>
		<p>“A personnel officer must know how to get people of ordinary ability to perform in an extraordinary manner. As Marshall W Fishwick rightly says, <em>the uncommitted life isn’t worth living…</em>” I tried to impress him fearing the losing battle.</p>
		<p>“Look, we want someone who knows the procedures, rules, and regulations of the company. Recruitment, verification of antecedents, maintaining personal files, annual confidential reports, what you call ACRs, joining report, bond agreements etc. are the real functions of a personnel officer. Understand the ground realities before you give such theoretical answers in any interview next time.” He gestured indicating that I was no more required. I thanked the committee and left. I could almost hear him whispering to others for wasting the valuable time of the selection committee. Later I came to know that the fellow with the gloomy look was the chief of personnel. I also learnt that the personnel chief had the final say in selection matters.</p>
		<p>In a week’s time, I got another opportunity. This time from a company dealing with the management of all the airports of the country – The Airports Authority of India. I thanked God for not getting selected in the earlier interview.</p>
		<p>Once again I went confidently, prepared better to grab the offer this time. I was sure, I would make it.</p>
		<p>“What are the functions of a personnel officer?” the same question haunted me while I was faring extremely well. I looked at the person. He was sitting at the centre. He must be the Personnel guy, I guessed. But he appeared to be verybright! He must have done up his face well, I consoled myself. I had already learnt the trick of the (interview) trade. I knew how to satisfy such stone-age creatures.</p>
		<p>“Maintaining personal files, Annual Confidential Reports, what we call ‘ACRs’, verification of antecedents, recruitment, designing the advertisements, selection, induction, execution of bonds…” I went on tricking with him but the guy continued looking straight into my eyes as if probing to find something more.</p>
		<p>“Manpower planning, MIS, mobility plans, deployment and postings…” I went on with my game play. This time I had slightly changed the stakes by trying the <em>rummy</em> of the <em>basics</em>. But his sharp eyes were expecting more from me.</p>
		<p>“Union matters, collective bargaining and negotiations, managing strikes and lock-outs, disciplinary matters…” I went on. This time I used my trump card to catch him on the IR front. I was sure it would click. But the guy was looking for something else. I became nervous. ‘Was he not a personnel guy?’ I started suspecting his credibility. I lost hope. I decided to stop the game.</p>
		<p>“And motivation, team building, morale building…” I uttered chewing my words disgustingly apprehending losing the battle once again.</p>
		<p>“Young guy, I’m here not to hear such important functions as your last priorities. A personnel officer exists primarily to take care of the morale of people. I am not interested in the long list of rituals you narrated. I thought, you know your profession!” I was not selected. Once again I had earned the wrath of the Personnel guy, though I tried the best trickery.</p>
		<p>A couple of months passed. I was once again sitting before another selection committee. Everything was going well until the same question possessed me once again. The guy who wanted me to describe the personnel functions was again the personnel chief, sitting at the centre. I paused to count 10 and decided to ask a frank question.</p>
		<p>“Sir, which school of thought do you belong to – old school of thought or modern?” I asked point blank, deciding firmly – no matter if I lost the race.</p>
		<p>“What made you ask that?” His smile was suggestive of his frank mind. I narrated my tale without mincing words. He heard me patiently.</p>
		<p>“We select you,” he declared looking at his other colleagues to seek their acquiescence. “I liked your openness. I found you are transparent. To my mind, openness and transparency are the best qualities for any manager, let alone the personnel discipline.”</p>
		<p>I was amazed wondering which school of thought he belonged to! For sure, he wasn’t talking superficially. He was bestowing upon me an untaught wisdom in the professional institutions. Wisdom unfolded its enchantments:</p>
