		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Sacred Cheating</h1>
		<p>This episode belongs to the days of my assignment in BHEL, Bhopal. I was looking after ‘social welfare’ of people. During that assignment I formulated many social welfare policies for my company.</p>
		<p>Once I was given an assignment to draft the maiden social security scheme of the company – Death Relief Scheme – to provide some monetary relief to the widows or the dependants of the deceased employees. I drafted a simple legal-jargon free scheme. It was presented before an empowered committee for its final approval. Believe me – no member of the committee was above the level of manager (For sure, Peter Block had not introduced the philosophy of Empowerment, then), yet empowered.</p>
		<p>“Why have you provided a too legalistic clause, in such a simple scheme?” asked S Chatterjee, one of the managers, referring to a particular clause.</p>
		<p>“Just as a safe-guard against any cheating,” I soberly gave a justification.</p>
		<p>“How much will each member of the scheme lose in case of cheating?” he asked.</p>
		<p>“One Rupee,” I promptly replied.</p>
		<p>“How much will the beneficiary get in case of cheating?” He shot another question.</p>
		<p>“Twenty thousand Rupees,” I coolly replied.</p>
		<p>“What do you think – who has the chances to cheat?” His sparkling eyes were biting me.</p>
		<p>“Wife… I mean, widow…, widow of a deceased employee.” I don’t know why I so badly fumbled!</p>
		<p>“Then, I sincerely wish,” after a pause he told, “Let the widow cheat.” He went on, “Let the widow get Rs 20,000 even by cheating – after all what we lose is only a buck per person! Why are you Personnel fellows so chicken hearted! Delete the legal clause – let there be some purposeful ambiguity to a widow’s advantage. Let her cheat all of us – after all she has lost her everything.” I found as if he is feeling widow’s agony in his heart; as if his heart was beating for such ill-fated widows.</p>
		<p>His words were harshly beating my eardrums. Suddenly I came out of the legal slumber of my profession. There is a distinct difference between HRD Systems and criminal penal codes – we can’t equate our human assets with the hard-core criminals, I realized. The magnanimity of management lies in compassion. Sometimes ambiguity in system is desirable. Wisdom dawned upon me.</p>
		<p>This single incident has changed my professional approach and helped develop a positive perspective towards human aspects. This was the turning point in my HR outlook.</p>
