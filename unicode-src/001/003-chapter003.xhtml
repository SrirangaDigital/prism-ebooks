		<p>I look back to the late seventies of twentieth century.</p>
		<p>A theft had taken place in the BHEL staff canteen. The cook, it was reported, had stolen 12 <em>laddus</em> (sweets). The general manager (Personnel) had ordered a <em>prima facie</em> inquiry, intending to take stern action against the pilferage.</p>
		<p>I was called by my boss, O W Prahalad, who was junior in hierarchy to the general manager (Personnel).</p>
		<p>“I assign this task to you,” he told me handing over the instructions. “But I want you to set an example in the history of disciplinary cases. You shall initiate ‘holy’ disciplinary proceedings against him.” He paused. “Find out what made the cook steal the <em>laddus</em>. Does he have too many children? Are they half-fed? Perhaps his beloved young daughter demanded sweets from him – there could be many causes!”</p>
		<p>He gave me a 10-rupee note. “Take some sweets along with you for his children,” he said. “I am sure they need it. Oh, and take care that you do not embarrass the cook by too much probing. Let him not feel too small. Try to rehabilitate him psychologically.”</p>
		<p>I was looking at the great soul – my boss. Tears blinked in my eyes. Once again wisdom was imparted to me:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Some holy methods are<br /> much more effective than<br /> mechanical legal<br />proceedings </em></p>
		<p><em>Discipline is the bridge between goals and<br /> accomplishment </em></p>
