		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he 1970s were breathing their last. My assignment in the Himalayas unravelled many a mysterious truth not only relating to nature but also to industrial relations.</p>
		<p>On finding a worker guilty of grave misconduct for rioting in a drunken condition at the site of Tissa dam, I decided to place him under suspension pending disciplinary proceedings against him. But the union would not allow me to do so. I knew the delinquent worker was an important <em>office bearer</em> of the recognized union. The pressure was not quite unnatural. The general secretary insisted to give him just one week’s time, after which he wanted to come and discuss the issue with me. He was playing delaying tactics to gain time, I was sure. It was a time worn practice. I thought of neglecting his request and going ahead. I did not believe in negotiating disciplinary matters with the union. They too knew my approach. But somehow I decided to wait for a week – it was perhaps my sixth sense, which persuaded me to suspend the suspension.</p>
		<p>But seven days didn’t really pass. It was just the 5<sup>th</sup> day. I got a call over wireless fromTissa. It was the general secretary of the union. He thanked me first for cooperating with him. I thought I knew what he was going to say next. But he didn’t say what I expected. He said, I could go ahead with the suspension. I just couldn’t believe. I didn’t think it appropriate to probe further. My purpose was served. Placing an <em>office bearer</em> of the recognized union under suspension would provide a sure deterrent. I issued the suspension orders.</p>
		<p>Next day the truth was unfastened by the vigilance. It appears the general secretary conducted the <em>prima facie</em> inquiries himself at the work spot on behalf of his union and was convinced of the commission of misconduct by his most trusted <em>office bearer.</em> He first dropped him from the executive committee in an emergency meeting and then only allowed the management to take the disciplinary action against him. “An office bearer with a <em>prima facie</em> charge of rioting in a drunken condition cannot continue in the position of honour,” he proclaimed and accordingly a resolution to that effect was passed by the executive committee. The worker who was suspended by me was no longer an <em>office bearer</em> of the union.</p>
		<p>‘The Himalayas are really the place where dwell the Saints and Sufis’ I realized in my hearts. The mystery that shrouded over the issue for five days unfolded by the union by its own conduct. A new wisdom came to me with the shining sunrays peeping through the range of mountains:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Unions can also muster courage<br />and set examples of discipline<br />ever found in management books.<br />Discipline is not the management’s<br />monopoly alone. Unions<br />can also franchise it</em></p>
