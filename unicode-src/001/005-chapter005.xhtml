		<p><span class="bigletter">N</span>ational Hydro-electrical Power Corporation (NHPC) was a strange place. We didn’t understand each other’s language though everyone spoke English. The problem was of <em>wavelength</em>. I used to talk what I had learnt from the pages of modern management. What they practiced were the procedures. It was sickening to perform rituals. Every letter necessarily to start with the phrase, “I am directed to say…” Even the letter of dismissal would have a prelude; “The competent authority is pleased to terminate your services…”</p>
		<p>A five-day cricket test shrinks to s single day; the test match can be played overnight; the red ball can become white; the white uniform can gain colours – but no change in their procedures would be brought about. I got vexed.</p>
		<p>Under such a desperate condition, once I included my own name in the list of surplus executives of the project. It was not merely to steam out frustration but also to get rid of the ‘wonderland’ with ‘stone-age creatures’.</p>
		<p>AS Chatrat, my chief engineer (who was later designated as general manager) didn’t take it so kindly. He called me and said, “I always took the suggestions from you as constructive thoughts from a satisfied officer. Today, after seeing this note of yours, I have sensed for the first time that you have jumped the fence. In future, I will keep in mind that the suggestion has come from a frustrated mind. Obviously, a frustrated officer cannot be judged on the face value!”</p>
		<p>I shivered in my spine. Not because the weather was cold, nor out of fear. It was a thrill of a strange kind. The one whom I took as a stone-age person, came out with a thought that I had never read in any modern management book. His management philosophy unravelled a fresh wisdom:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Satisfaction and frustration are<br /> diagonally opposite – to<br /> balance, the treatment should<br /> vary </em></p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>A man can fail many times, but he is not a failure until he begins to blame somebody else</em></p>
