		<p>In the Himalayas, biting cold begins from September. It is during this month that the orchards on the mountainous heights bear fruit – apples, cherries, apricots, plums and berries! The blood red fruits, cold waves, swaying pines, snow clad peaks, picturesque and strikingly beautiful valleys create an environment for wine, dine and dance. It is the season for the cottage distillery owners to mint money. When wine showers from the cloudbursts, a project like ours dealing with more than 10,000 workers, contract labourers, casual and work charged workmen, supervisors and engineers cannot remain alienated; alcoholism at work among the workers used to be the prime concern of the Management during winters.</p>
		<p>It was one such intoxicating cold day while in a meeting with the trade union leaders my general manager was discussing the issue impressing upon them the need to counsel workers to desist from such alcoholic indulgence. While listening to the sermon, Surjit Singh Dogra, the President of the trade union, was mischievously chewing his smile, I could observe. When my general manager went to the extent of saying that he would take stern action with the assistance of the local administrative authorities to see that the drunkards were put behind bars, the president of the union let off his smile and said calmly – “Sir, then who will run the management???”</p>
		<p>Naughty grins were struggling to get released and hover on every face, but no one could smirk. Nevertheless, the tone and tenor of general manager’s sermon subdued. The issue of black jack ended with a kneejerk! The sarcastic punch, given with such ease by a simple query, could only come from a person of high wisdom, I realized.</p>
		<p><em>Wisdom radiates wisdom</em>; the age-old saying flashed like lightning.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Those who live in the glasshouses<br /> should not throw stones at others.<br /> The same principle, which underlies workmen, underlies<br />managers and top team!</em></p>
		<p><em>The illeterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn </em></p>
		<p class="text-right">– Alvin Toffler<br />(Future Shock - 1972)</p>
