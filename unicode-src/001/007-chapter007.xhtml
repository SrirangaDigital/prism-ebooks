		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Get back to Basics</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">B</span>y this time I was two years old in NHPC, with my posting at Baira Suil Project, in the Himalayas.</p>
		<p>It was a spine-biting Sunday morning. I was in a relaxed mood while I got a call from AS Chatrath, my general manager. He used to live in one portion of the posh guesthouse, built on the top of a hill. Our township was in the valley below. He wanted me to join for breakfast. I had only two options – either to call for a jeep from the transport department or to climb the heights following the zigzag shortcuts. I decided to walk.</p>
		<p>During the breakfast, the silence was to the extent of a lull – that was indicative of a brewing storm. Over hot coffee, my boss broke the silence asking me point blank, “What is wrong with you?” Though I was ready to face stormy weather after a lull, I wasn’t ready for such a blunt and brute question.</p>
		<p>“I haven’t understood you, Sir,” I replied politely and a bit diplomatically to gain some time to count 10 in allowing my ‘A’ – the ‘Adult’ – to emerge from my frightened ‘C’ (Child ego-state) and also to compute a rational answer.</p>
		<p>“I am referring to your note which you attached to the manpower plan of the project,” he told me. Now I remembered. I had included my name in the mobility plan for elsewhere postings. I did this in frustration as I was feeling suffocated in the public sector, which was managed like a government project. Before formation of NHPC, Baira Suil Hydroelectricity Project was management by Central Public Works Department (CPWD).Though this project was placed under the control of newly formed public sector, – NHPC – all the obsolete government practices continued.</p>
		<p>“Are you not happy with me?” he asked politely.</p>
		<p>“No sir, there is nothing like that...”</p>
		<p>“Then why do you want to go? You know well, how much I like your work. You also know, how much I trust you. To be frank with you, I need you.”</p>
		<p>I was totally moved. I just broke down – the ice was broken in real sense. I explained to him how I was taken as an odd-man-out in the total project management governed by the FRs, SRs, CPWD Manuals, etc. (Fundamental Rules, Service Rules of Central government and Central Public Works Department Manuals). All these did not jell well with the concepts I was taught. These rules were meant to manage the government machinery. They belonged to bureaucracy not to entrepreneurship. And that modern and scientific management techniques did not approve of such bureaucratic practices. Here he stopped me. He looked straight in my eyes and said, “I too was a young and energetic manager a couple of decades ago. I too tried to change the world. But the world didn’t change. Slowly I changed myself. Today you talk of modern management, scientific management and arouse a strange feeling in me that I have become obsolete. After a couple of decades, you will grow old like me and sit in this chair. And some Young Turk will sit before you – as you are sitting before me. Then, he will tell you – he will tell you with more force than you told me today – ‘Sir, you have gone obsolete’. He will screech, ‘your knowledge and your approach and your thoughts and your practices and your blah blah... do not conform with the modern management’. Believe me, you will not relish the episode. What you say modern management today, will not be of any relevance tomorrow.”</p>
		<p>There was a silence – a deep silence of the Himalaya’s winter heights.</p>
		<p>On returning, after a strange compromise of <em>old</em> and <em>modern</em> thoughts between the two of us, for the first time I realized the unclothed truth, everything, which is modern today will antiquate tomorrow. I couldn’t be an exception to such a natural phenomenon. As regards getting old, I was not perturbed as aging was a process that would take its own course without an exception. But I was not mentally ready to reconcile with the fact that in the course of time my knowledge would get antiquated and I would become obsolete.</p>
		<p>What I am today is the result of the wisdom that dawned upon me at that unforgettable moment of time – <em>in the course of time my knowledge would get antiquated and I would become obsolete</em>. I decided, it would not happen to me. I started reading books – both modern and ancient. During those days I wrote my first article on management theme.</p>
		<p>Later, when I entered the age of computer, I asked my son, Feroz, what was the latest computer to buy from Singapore and he advised me to go for Apple. I put my leg on the chest of my first Macintosh an ibook. Learning not just a new operating system but new applications too. I fell in love with the Mac and there was no looking back. Later I added an ‘iMac’ and then a ‘MacBook Pro’ to my ‘modern’ arsenal. No good book ever escaped my attention. I developed authorship skills so that my appetite for reading and learning increases per force.</p>
		<p>Good or bad, I am the product of just one incident – had my general manager not dawned that wisdom upon me, yes, I would have become obsolete like the rest. The secret of my success lies in ‘getting back to basics’, not sometimes, always!</p>
