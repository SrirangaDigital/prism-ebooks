		<p>The Himalayas have nostalgic values for me. I found the valleys the native place of wisdom. I do not refer here the Saints or Sufis. I talk about the sagacity that came to me from the management monks.</p>
		<p>I recall. It was an unprecedented winter when the fury of weather brought destruction in the valley where I was working in a hydro-electrical project during the mid seventies. One of our sites – Tissa Dam – was totally cut off by landslides. It was just a chance that the senior most person available at the head quarters in the valley for taking crucial decisions at such an hour of test was HC Bharadawaj, Superintending Engineer (equivalent to manager or senior manager in the manufacturing organizations).</p>
		<p>The very first step the HC Bharadwaj took was that he shifted his place of operation from his carpeted wellstructured and safe room to the wireless control-room, which was prone to land slides. This jacked up the morale of the project people.</p>
		<p>“Most of the workers with their families are rendered homeless,” the first problem was posed to him on wireless from the Tissa Dam site.</p>
		<p>“Convert all the official complexes into rehabilitation centres,” Bharadwaj gave the decision without any hesitation.</p>
		<p>“The grief stricken families need medicines,” another problem was posed to him, next day.</p>
		<p>“Take medicines from the project medical stores even for those villagers who are not eligible,” he took another bold decision.</p>
		<p>“The store is locked. The pharmacist is not traceable for past two days.”</p>
		<p>“Break open the medical store,” was the precise and firm reply, demonstrating that the executive exists to make sensible exception to general rules.</p>
		<p>“There is no improvement in the weather conditions. Our ration is exhausting fast. We are afraid, children may die of hunger.” The problem was posed to him on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day.</p>
		<p>“Take the ration from the officers’ houses who are away on leave or tour.”</p>
		<p>“Their houses are locked,” the voice was shaky, obviously not owing to piercing winter.</p>
		<p>“Break open the doors,” the manager coolly gave the fearless decision by breaking all the norms of management and civil administration.</p>
		<p>“It will be an illegal act.” The voice on the wireless was nervous.</p>
		<p>“Don’t bother about legality, I take full responsibility. I repeat – break open the locks and take all the ration available from these houses.” His orders were absolutely clear – he didn’t mince words nor gave any pause to count till ten.</p>
		<p>Later, the manager also organized aerial food drop by seeking the assistance from the Air Force, an action much beyond his delegation of powers.</p>
		<p>Under the ‘play-safe ‘ strategic environment, widespread in most of the companies today, the sagas of professional bravery of this kind prior to Peter Block’s contraption of his empowered managers, simply appear to be tales out of a comic book.</p>
		<p>The wholesome wisdom which came to me was simple but unique:</p>
