		<p>My colleague (finance chief ) and I were trusted lieutenants of our general manager, Joseph Polycarp. Whenever we made recommendations, he would blindly sign for any proposal.</p>
		<p>We once sent in a sealed cover, a proposal to fix a guy who was always trying to trick with our general manager. We knew he had carried false tales to the corporate office against the general manager. Several times he had tried to misuse his rapport with the union chaps against him. Once he had gone to the extent of dividing the unit on community basis. He took our general manager as his <em>bete noire.</em> He was too cunning to be caught on a wrong foot. But, it was a question of time. We could at last trap him in a fraudulent case. We were sure, our general manager, would hug both of us for demonstrating a gesture of rare loyalty towards him.</p>
		<p>We were quite disappointed, when Polycarp called both of us only to recite a sermon of benevolence. After showering splendid sagacity, he concluded:</p>
		<p>“Remember one thing as you grow in hierarchy – learn to show more grace and shower mercy. Acquire magnanimity; be prudent and judicious. Position grants you power. Power belongs to God. It takes you closer to Him. Learn to be a Godly person. Reward good work; forget the petty sins. If God were to punish the sinners, none of us would exist. It is always safer to err on the side of mercy. Do your own soul searching, before suggesting to punish others.”</p>
		<p>Scores of years have rolled by but his words always make a blaring echo in my mind whenever a matter pertaining to reward or punishment arises. The wisdom that he launched upon us was synonymous with the adage:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Don’t forget little kindness;<br /> don’t remember small faults </em></p>
		<p><em>True nobility is exempt from fear </em></p>
