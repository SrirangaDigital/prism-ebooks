		<p>Cement factories are normally located at Godforsaken places, near lime stone deposits in extremely non-friendly dry terrain. As personnel chief in a cement company. I was once posted at a remote place, where people from the city appeared bizarre. Visits of senior people from the corporate office always used to attract crowds – unions, associations, backward classes, ex-servicemen, contract labour unions, casuals, village <em>sarpanch</em>, government officials and a horde of such people expecting to meet the corporate bureaucrats for one reason or the other. We used to plan strategies to avoid the crowd without hurting their feelings.</p>
		<p>On receiving a telex about our chairman’s visit to the factory, our general manager called an emergent meeting to plan the various arrangements. One of the strategic decisions was to keep the crowd away. I was given this ticklish task. I started working on it. The first thing I did was to keep his programme confidential. The Security was given proper instructions to guard the premises and so on.</p>
		<p>When Col S P Wahi, our chairman reached the guesthouse he called me and said, “Please ensure that anyone who wants to meet me is allowed to do so.” Everyone looked at him, astonishingly. It was a real puzzle to me. I didn’t know how to explain to him the problem that he was inviting for himself.</p>
		<p>However, I had no option. People began coming and I went on disturbing him. Not once did he raise his eyebrows nor show annoyance at me. He would often come out of the room himself to talk to them. Sometimes, he would simply greet them and take up the paper for reference. He saw to it that none went back disappointed. He did what he meant. He compromised with his priorities.</p>
		<p>The gesture appeared quite ordinary, although it had a tremendous impact on the morale of the people. They felt they were heard. They sensed that the leader had concern for them. They were convinced that they were more important than the meeting-agenda.</p>
		<p>The greatness of a leader lies in his approach, I realized. He means what he says and does what he says. He is aware of his actions. He is also aware of the greater impact of such pygmy noble gestures.</p>
