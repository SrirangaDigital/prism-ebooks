		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he mid-eighties brought a lot of learning experiences to me. It was my second assignment in HMT. I was transferred from HMT Lamps to HMT Bearing, Hyderabad. (Late) SS Ahuja was then my general manager – a turnaround expert. Once he called me and asked for feedback. I gave him feedback about our training workshops, vigilance matters, morale of executives and other such issues.</p>
		<p>“That’s all OK,” he said. “But I have called you specifically for some genuine feedback about me. I have completed three months here in this factory. I want to know what people feel about me, my style of leadership, my approach, and my performance?”</p>
		<p>I highlighted a few genuine pieces of positive feedback. He was not satisfied. He insisted on negative feedback. He was keen to know, “How do I look to others – good or bad?”</p>
		<p>With a rapport of hardly three months, I was not inclined to risk uttering something that he might not find palatable. I was conscious of a story I had recently read about such a gesture of courage:</p>
		<p>It appears that Adolf Hitler once decided to gather some negative feedback about him. None of his subordinates dared; everybody praised him. When he insisted, one General gave some mild negative feedback. Hitler was delighted with his honesty and courage, and he suggested they discuss it in detail in the adjacent chamber. Both went inside, after ten minutes only one person came out of the chamber – Hitler.</p>
		<p>I didn’t want to make the same mistake with my new boss. But my boss was relentless and I gave in - giving him a mouthful of negative feedback. He listened to me keenly and then thanked and asked me to see him again the next month.</p>
		<p>When I went to him after a month, he asked me, “Did you find any improvement in my style, approach, or behaviour during the last month?” I made no hesitation, but told him frankly, “Yes, sir – of course!”</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>I was enlightened:<br />To make headway, one must<br />improve one’s head. And negative<br />feedback is the best source<br />of improvement</em></p>
