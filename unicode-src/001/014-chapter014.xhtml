		<p>“Ability is of little account without opportunity,” said Napoleon once.</p>
		<p>But for those who belong to the reserved category in India, in some of the cases opportunity subordinates their ability.</p>
		<p>I had heard many stories of misuse of concessions. And when Gaikward, a personnel officer, HMT Bearings, belonging to the reserved category reminded me just a day before his interview that he belonged to that privileged class, I could not take such reminder kindly. I was a bit annoyed, but maintained my calm.</p>
		<p>“You know sir, I belong to the reserved category,” he had remarked.</p>
		<p>“Yes,” I tried to avoid the conversation with the candidate who was expected to appear for the interview just the next day.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Madan Gopal is also appearing for interview tomorrow for the same position,” he continued.</p>
		<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
		<p>“He is junior to me,” he paused looking at me. I kept quiet. He went on.</p>
		<p>“Not only is he junior to me but also he is from the general category. He does not belong to the reserved category”. My raised eye-brows, skin-folds on my forehead and a very harsh “Yes” couldn’t deter him. He continued.</p>
		<p>“Obviously, the committee is bound to select me for promotion…” He was gradually trespassing the boundaries of official decorum.</p>
		<p>“… could be,” I gave a political answer, knowing well that I had no much option than to select him.</p>
		<p>“But, sir… Madan Gopal is a much better performer,” he twisted the topic. I just did not understand what he was tricking by adding the sauce of confusion to a savoury dish! I decided to keep mum and he continued.</p>
		<p>“People will lose confidence in merit,” he paused, perhaps to choose appropriate words. “I have come to request you, sir – please promote Madan Gopal, he deserves it much more than I do.”</p>
		<p>“Do you know what you mean?” I thought that he was pleading for Madan, taking his own promotion for granted.</p>
		<p>“I know, sir, there is only one vacancy. I am also aware that if I am not selected, I will not be eligible for promotion for the next one year. If you want, I can give in writing. Believe me, I am not interested in my promotion, because I know someone else deserves it more than I do.”</p>
		<p>Next day, during the interview, he took the same stand. Obviously, he lost the opportunity which was virtually in his lap.</p>
		<p>For the first time, I understood what the great Shakespeare meant when he wrote, “Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.” What a great fall! I felt envious. I was totally sold out to this great monk, who had broken the myths and carved a niche.</p>
		<p>I can never forget his gesture of great sacrifice for the cause of a healthy work environment, where management could reward based on performance.</p>
