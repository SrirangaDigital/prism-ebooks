		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>t was November ’87. I had then recently taken charge at the corporate level. One of my assignments was to fine-tune the Personnel policies. I started one by one.</p>
		<p>I found ambiguity in one of the very important Personnel policies, for it was too brief. I thought of streamlining it. I discussed with my immediate corporate boss, MK Jaura.</p>
		<p>“Why do you want to modify it?” he asked.</p>
		<p>It is too brief,” was my brief answer.</p>
		<p>“So what!”</p>
		<p>“It is ambiguously brief.” I touched the <em>ambiguity</em> to win the dialogue.</p>
		<p>“Ambiguity is strength sometimes. Learn to acquire mastery over brevity. Create ambiguity thoughtfully – it pays,” he gave a tip. I simply smiled, taking it as boss’s last say, which is a very common phenomenon.</p>
		<p>It was much later when I understood what my boss had in his mind. I was reading a book on Japanese Management. The concept of Juggling described there was nothing but an art to create a purposeful ambiguity through brevity. This technique of transaction without commitment, but sustaining the faith and confidence of the aggrieved person is considered fruitful. My urge to discover more about ambiguity aggravated.</p>
		<p>Lately I discovered:</p>
		<p>‘Probably the most famous source of ambiguous pronouncement was the oracle at Delphi in the ancient world. One of the oracle’s best-known prophecies came in the year 480 BC. The Persians under Xerxes had invaded the Greek mainland and had successfully conquered two-third of the country. Naturally, the Athenian city-fathers were concerned as to which course of action they should take against the oncoming Persians. Their suppliants got the prophecy from Delphi: The wooden wall will save you and your children.</p>
		<p>One person suggested to erect a wooden barricade on the Acropolis – that’s what the ‘wooden wall’ meant.</p>
		<p>But the city-fathers knew that the oracle was intentionally ambiguous to force them to go beyond the first right answer. They tried to think of all the contexts – both literal and metaphorical. After some thought, they came up with another idea. Could the wooden wall to which the oracle was referring be the result of all of the Athenian wooden-hulled ship lined up next to one another? From a distance, the ships would indeed look like a wooden wall. The city-fathers decided, therefore, that the battle should be a naval one rather than a land one. The oracle’s ambiguity forced the Athenians to consult the deeper wisdom of their own intuition, and consider alternatives.’</p>
		<p>I understood the magic behind ambiguity and brevity. I realized, how badly the policies can be messed up by providing clarification upon clarification. Sometimes the clarification overwrites the original text with riches of hidden oracles provided by the city-fathers of Athens. I actualized the depth of wisdom imparted by my boss almost two decades ago.</p>
