		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he time was the beginning of ’89.</p>
		<p>AK (Arvind Kumar) and PK (Pratik Kumar) created a stir in the organization. It was not the selection through XLRI campus of these 23 year old professional guys, but their posting in the Personnel Directorate at the corporate level, that raised the siren of threat and created anxiety among the senior personnel pundits of HMT.</p>
		<p>Both, AK and PK were place with me. People peeped in, just to glance at these young men chosen to dictate the fate of 30,000 employees of the company around the country. However, they could hardly notice anything great except their shy gestures fluttering over innocence. They were convinced – the management had gone crazy. After all, there was no dirth of veterans who greyed their hair by dealing in Personnel matters.</p>
		<p>A week later, HR Alva, my director (personnel) asked whether the campus recruits had joined. My reply that they had already joined a week ago, was not taken very kindly by him. He was sorry that I did not introduce them to him. I went back and returned with the youngsters. He welcomed them by getting up from his chair and regretted that he couldn’t see them earlier because of his busy schedule, leaving me wondering how nicely he had taken the entire blame on himself. After a 30-minute chat at the cost of his important schedules, he made the concluding remarks:</p>
		<p>“You see, we are a 35 year old company. We are carrying on by virtue of our experience. We are not able to see the dust of obsolescence that must have gathered on most of us. You are young. You have come fresh from a professional institute with updated knowledge. Feel free to see me. Never hesitate in correcting whenever you observe that we have gone astray. I want to learn from you.”</p>
		<p>I was observing our director (personnel). His words showed neither hypocrisy nor modesty – he was plainly speaking from his heart. A person who was know for his professional excellence, was requesting the youngsters to teach him and correct him for they knew the latest. I now understood the secret of his excellence. The thoughts of my favourite management monk of the 5<sup>th</sup> Century BC – Lao Tsu – started appearing from nowhere. Wisdom dazzled:</p>
