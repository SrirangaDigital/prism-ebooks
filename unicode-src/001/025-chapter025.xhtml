		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Execute ‘Love-bonds’</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he issue was, <em>how to resolve the problem of jumping the contractual obligations by the management trainees during the bond period?</em> Somehow I was not convinced with management’s policy of retaining the talents per force of legal bond. Market was in favour of talents, who would never like to get bound with legal bondages. I, therefore, initiated a note requesting my Chairman and Managing Director to drop the policy of execution of bond in the case of Campus Recruitments. But the file was returned by director finance, endorsing his views: <em>Keep the original titles of the property of the surety in the custody of the management. </em></p>
		<p>“Why not hold someone to ransom, if the solution to the problem was to be discovered only through whims?” I thought in disgust. A similar suggestion had come from a stone-age manager the other day, who had suggested to increase the period and value of bond to resolve the issue. “How does it differ from the bonded labour concept?” I had thought then. My nostalgia started whacking my memory harshly.</p>
		<p>The turnover of the IT experts was alarmingly high. The lucrative compensation package in the market and the poaching of IT professionals by the competitors were other dimensions, which had worsened the problem. Why single out IT or computer engineers? For the matter, retention of high fliers and professional talents was an open challenge to HRD. The good yield from the campus recruitment at the premier institutes of the country until last year, had come down drastically. While interviewing the candidates, quite often we were interrupted only to know the coordinator that the candidate was already sold out. To address this problem, the management decided to go for angling in some other institutes in the vicinity. However, it was destined to make the execution of bond compulsory. The recruitment committee faced the problem during the Pre-PreparatoryTalk (PPT) itself. The youngsters were not happy with the condition of the Bond. However, we could persuade them. The interview commenced.</p>
		<p>Our experience with the first three candidates was not very encouraging. A glance at the CV of the fourth candidate showed a ray of hope. She had an excellent academic record. Her confident entry, sparkling face and a winner’s smirk announced, <em>Yes, I am the candidate you were looking for</em>! To be frank, the committee got slightly excited with the discovery of the prospective candidate. But before we could ask any question she wanted to say something. We decided to hear her first.</p>
		<p>“I am an orphan,” she started. “Is she trying to play the game, <em>Poor Me</em>,” I thought suspiciously. But she continued. “I lost my father, when I was in the first year of my engineering. My mother toiled hard to make both ends meet. But she vowed to see that I came out as an Engineer. She did succeed. But her sweat will dry up only when I get a job. Believe me sir, I badly need a job.” Her blinking wet eyes won all our sympathy. She was trying to gain our favour, I was sure. Sensing the human behaviour is supposed to be my forte.</p>
		<p>“But I have not come to seek charity. I want to be very sure, would you insist on a bond if I am selected?” Her voice was well modulated and every word she spoke carried weight. My forte melted down.</p>
		<p>“Let us interview you first, we will discuss this issue later,” I suggested.</p>
		<p>“I am sorry sir. I wouldn’t like to waste your and my time,” she said. She was absolutely clear what she was speaking. We whispered among ourselves. We had no option. The policy of the company was not in favour of the situation.</p>
		<p>We cut a sorry figure. She didn’t give any impression of her regrets. She thanked, bowed and left, carrying with her the winner’s smile.</p>
		<p>This incident reminded me of a story of “The Lost Sheep” that I had read during my school days.</p>
		<p>A sheep found a hole in the fence and crept through it. He wandered far and could not find his way back. And then he realised that he was being followed by a wolf. He ran and ran, but the wolf kept chasing him, until the shepherd rescued him and carried him lovingly back to the fold.</p>
		<p>And inspite of everyone’s advice the shepherd refused to nail up the hole in the fence!</p>
		<p>If you love something set it free, and it will come back to you if it deserves your love. By putting fences we are likely to lose our relationship. The silken bonds of love are more enduring than walls and fences.</p>
		<p>The wisdom that I got during my school days was lost in modern management’s policies and systems.</p>
		<p>I came out of my reminiscence. The file carrying the decision to padlock the bondage norms was lying before me. “Are we really ignorant of the Present, or trying to be willfully blind?” I asked myself. More important was the changing environment – this happened while we were all agog and afoot to bring about a stirring change in the organization to keep pace with the fast moving time. The file started blurring and morphed into the faded features of the girl who had us realize that potential candidates are out of reach of headhunters, who follow the conventional tricks. Her unspoken words vibrated my eardrums. Wisdom whacked:</p>
