		<p><span class="bigletter"><em>C</em></span><em>reativity</em> and <em>Innovation</em> are two phases of the same coin. Those who have a creative mind can alone innovate. <em>Creativity</em> is input; <em>Innovation</em> is output. Likewise, learning is breathing in; imparting knowledge is breathing out. Those who impart training must also be open to learning. Those who breathe in alone can breathe out. Such a simple HRD equation people understand not!</p>
		<p>Again, the ability to learn depends on one’s <em>learning horizon.</em> For some, <em>learning horizon</em> is spaceless and learning is endless – they go on expanding their learning horizon and become great learners. Their appetite for learning never ends.</p>
		<p>This saga is of one such worshipper of knowledge.</p>
		<p>P C Neogy, my CEO always remained an inquisitive learner. He often used to say, “Recharge yourself from the books and learn from everyone and from every incident. Begin your job, afresh everyday.” He frequently used to quote Swami Vivekananda, <em>Every soul is potentially divine! </em></p>
		<p>P C Neogy untiringly persuaded his people to use the right side of their brain. “The brain is brilliantly uncreative in the sense that it will use the same pattern again and again under all circumstances,” Once he explained to me, borrowing the words from Edward de Bono. Creativity comes only through meditation,’ was his unshaken faith and Management by Meditation’ was his steadfast religion. He always gave precedence to the imaginative phase over the practical phase.</p>
		<p>It took me years to follow the flight of his thoughts. What he perhaps meant was, First ‘shape’ the idea softly, then bake to harden it with practice. Obviously, one need to go through two phases – imaginative phase and practical phase. I caught the catchphrase: Think something different to get something done original.</p>
		<p>“Why can’t you make the tractor-bonnets out of wood?” he suggested to an R &amp; D guy, only to see people around laughing in their sleeves.</p>
		<p>“I want slim watches; take a hacksaw and slice them!” He suggested to a watch designer during his visit top one of our watch factories located at a far-flung place. The echoes of the soundless smiles of those who were around him, reached me at the corporate office vibrating my eardrums. I bled on their ignorance for they knew not the kind of thinking, the management monk was trying to instill in their minds, which were filled with cold and stale stuff.</p>
		<p>And a day came, he gave a smacking whack on the right side of my head. I had gone to him to get his OK for campus recruitment to cover the shortage of HRD professionals caused by an unprecedented exodus owing to market demand. “Create HRD managers out of mud,” was his simple and plain solution. I looked at his pointed finger to gain insight. It was a beautiful painting of a potter who was training his daughter how to make potter out of clay. The inscription below captured my eyes – A Potter and the Clay.</p>
		<p>I understood what he meant. Like the potter, who was creating beautiful vessels out of the mud, he wanted me discover talents, train them and use them instead of going for outside recruitment. He wanted me to use my creative brain, instead of just following the routine pattern.</p>
		<p>Wrapped into jack Welch’s words, Wisdom dawned on me:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Don’t look elsewhere<br />to see what everyone thinks.<br />Think for yourself!</em></p>
