		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he 1992 descended leaving our company in a not too healthy situation. Reasons were many. But one of the undisputed reasons was the separation of one of the directors whose mother wit was his management wisdom; highly professionally qualified he was, though. He used to make commitments, not promises. His quick reflexes in decision-making hardly had a match. He was not afraid of losing at times. He used to speak politely and briefly allowing the natural outpouring of others. He knew how to vibrate and motivate people with his least intervention. There was no occasion when he must have tried to suddenly intervene powerfully or harshly, for he trusted and had full confidence in his people. Even in chaotic situations he knew how to keep his cool. He would follow his inner wisdom – mother with is the purest form wisdom. He was HR Alva – a genius!</p>
		<p>But in an organization everyone earns his adversaries. So it happened to him too. He was no exception to this natural phenomenon. Once after his exit, one such adversary tried to discount his worth by comparing him with another professional giant who was a voracious reader and was known for making references from management books.</p>
		<p>“See, how well he quotes from the management books!” He admired the latter, indirectly suggesting that HR Alva, the outgoing director was not so learned.</p>
		<p>“Yes, I agree with you,” I nodded my head. “One quotes – the other is to be quoted,” was my simple but spontaneous reply. What I just said was not much clear to me. Later when I thought in a meditating mood, the wisdom of Tao sparked:</p>

		<p>surface a mirror and shows others their images.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Don’t be content by simply<br />quoting others. Rise to the<br />extent to be quoted by others </em></p>
		<p><em>Honesty pays in long run – not sometimes, always </em></p>
