		<p><span class="bigletter">N</span>ow we come to a story from 1993. My CEO was taking a flight to Delhi and had sent a book from the airport for me, because he thought it would make useful reading for an HRD person. It was Peter F. Drucker’s Managing for the Future.</p>
		<p>It was neither the fame of the author nor the text of the book that moved me. It was the high-touch gesture of the CEO who sent a book from the airport for an HRD person. That gesture deeply touched my soul.</p>
		<p>At home later, I stood before a mirror – and I found in my image a person covered the dust of obsolescence. I rolled up my sleeves and decided to get back to the basics of what business management is all about. Wisdom dawned on me. During the nineties of nanoseconds, where speed and complexities make business management so different that we need to thrive on chaos just to keep the show on, we must get back those basics. It’s a matter of survival. Individual reading is no more sufficient – each bit of knowledge must float across the organization.</p>
		<p>The beginning of 21<sup>st</sup> century was more challenging. The second decade of the new century is not the climax. Tougher days are ahead.</p>
