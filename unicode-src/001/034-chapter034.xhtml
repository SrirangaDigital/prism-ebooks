		<p><span class="bigletter">A</span>n Indian Hindi film ‘Kagaz ke phool’ was a miserable failure on the box office. The film that flopped was one of the best creations of the cine genius, Guru Dutt, cried the critics. I didn’t appreciate it at all when I saw it along with my college friends, then. The same film when I saw later after a decade, I just wondered how it could have failed! Perhaps Guru Dutt tried to convey to the viewers before they attained the maturity required for art films.</p>
		<p>Today, delayering, flatter organization, networking, downsizing, flower structure, flatter pyramid do not remain mere buzzwords. The flatter organization is the need of the day to keep pace with the changing global scenario. We quote Toffler and John Naisbitt of Third wave and Megatrends as the management gurus who saw the future a decade early.</p>
		<p>While carrying out an HRD mission on delayering during my HMT days, I could not forget an Indian Management wizard who will like Guru Dutt of Kagaz ke Phool had tried to carry the lofty concepts much ahead of time and had failed.</p>
		<p>He was S V S Raghavan, the then Chairman and Managing Director of the Nava Ratana Company, BHEL. He was a genius and great visionary. His ideas failed because he was much ahead of the time. He had tried to convince his fellow directors of, what he had called as hierarchy-less organization, in the early seventies – years before Toffler or Naisbitt or Peter Drucker orTom Peters had made a prophecy. His idea of hierarchy-less organization was laughed out by his own fellow directors and general managers. He was hurt. He wrote personal letters to each of them perhaps only to get further negative response. Had he got a little bit of cooperation, he would have been an outrider. Today I comprehend the wisdom:</p>
