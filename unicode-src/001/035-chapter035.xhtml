		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>t was a festive occasion at IIM Bangalore. The tailor-made Management Programme for the technologists was being inaugurated. My presence was more than to honour the invitation – it had wider dimensions. Five technologists from my company were sponsored for this on-year especially designed post-graduation programme. I was keenly involved.</p>
		<p>The Chief guest somehow couldn’t make it. The responsibility of keynote address was shifted to another speaker. Obviously, the audience didn’t expect much from the surrogate.The speaker spoke amazingly well, punctuating speech with humility. I was profoundly impressed.</p>
		<p>On my return, I decided to write a letter to him, expressing my appreciation. I wrote, his was one of the rare talks I had heard. I expected a warm and quick response. Days and weeks passed. I didn’t get the response. When hope disappeared, like a fresh breeze came his humble words in print to convince me that the enchantment that I found in his verbal thoughts equally persisted in his aesthetic prose. I forgot all the moans and laments caused by his belated response. What caused solace, was again his humility. The humble words whizzed the hex:</p>
		<p>‘I took sometimes to reply because it is not easy to respond to a letter so rich in ideas and concepts. With people of erudition – poets, playwrights, men of letters like yourself in the audience, I should be careful in what I speak!’</p>
		<p>I was myself sobered by his humility. He had so humbly assigned his memorable talk to the high quality of the audience. Angling wisdom in his humility, I comprehended:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Humility is like an ocean —<br />greatness lies in its tranquillity </em></p>
		<p><em>There is no right way to do a wrong thing ! </em></p>
