		<p>“When the sea was calm</p>
		<p>All ships alike</p> 
		<p>showed mastership in floating.”</p>
		<p>The Shakespearean thought raises the basic question, <em>Is the sea calm? </em></p>
		<p>Today, <em>all ships alike cannot show mastership in floating</em>? The reason is simple – the sea is not calm.Those with superior quality alone can float. <em>Quality</em> is the watchword.</p>
		<p>November month is commemorated as the Quality Month every year. On the first day of November, everyone takes a quality oath. 1<sup>st</sup> November, 1993 was one such day. We had all gathered to perform the oath taking ceremony.</p>
		<p>“I solemnly pledge to devote and rededicate myself whole heartedly to achieve ever higher standards of quality by doing my job right first time, next time and every time,” the Chairman read the printed text loudly taxing his vocal chord and then everyone started repeating. I also joined the chorus, muttering a few words and swallowing the rest. The part of oath – doing my job right – had raised the basic doubt in my mind. Many bells started ringing in my mind.</p>
		<p>Is it ‘doing the thing right’ or ‘doing the right things’? I was struck. If the activity itself is not right, how does it make sense, if it performed right? I recollected the phrase I had read the other day – <em>there is no right way to do a wrong thing. </em>Thus, if a thing is not right, what matters if it is done right? To my mind, before we do the things right, more important is to do the right things first. An activity, which is not productive does not and cannot add any value even it is carried out ‘right first time, next time and all the time’. On the contrary, increase in the productivity of non-productive activity will only lead to some sort of value reduction. Driving fast towards East will only add more distance to the journey, if the destination happens to be towards West – higher is the speed, greater will be the distance. John Simpson’s <em>blank page </em>logic started casting wisdom.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>The key thing is flowcharting<br />all the processes. At each time<br />you ask about 10 times – Is<br />that adding value for the Customer?”<br />Doing right things should domineer<br />doing things right!</em></p>
