		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Mr. Heartware !</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span> have known Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) from my Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) days, when SCCL was one our prestigious clients and I Director, HR in BEML. Having served in a public sector myself, I knew SCCL was one of the toughest mining companies to work for. Time elapsed and I moved on to work for many other organizations until I floated my own consulting company ‘Intellects Biz’. It was then that SCCL invited me to seek my assistance for conducting workshops at their different mining complexes, in India.</p>
		<p>My meeting with Mr RH Khwaja was rather accidental.</p>
		<p>I received a call from, the then Group General Manager (HR), Chandrakant Sharma, asking me to conduct a retreat for SCCL employees that would include their Chairman, Directors and other senior management team member. He insisted that I keep the ‘Balanced Scorecard’ as the central theme of my training session. Upon learning that his CEO was an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer, I tried eluding the offer to take on this assignment. Officialdom and I do not go together. Even as the Director (HR) of a public sector company I could never establish heart-to-heart relationship with my administrative bosses – the bureaucrats.</p>
		<p>Chandrakanth was persistent and convinced me thus; He said, “<em>Mr. Siddiqui, I have already scored with my CEO, Mr. Khwaja that you have agreed to undertake this assignment. Upon my assertion all activities have already been arranged</em>”. He stressed, “<em>Should I fail to deliver my commitment, it is likely I shall lose my job</em>.” Call it emotional black mail, but I succumbed to it, leaving me with an inexplicable urge to meet his boss in flesh, who was so tough as a rock.</p>
		<p>Since the time I first met Mr. RH Khwaja at the resort – the venue of our retreat, he remained on my mental scanner. After assessing him through the day’s interaction I formed my opinion that though externally, he seemed to be tough, his underlying core was soft. I found his persona to be impressively disciplined and peppered with great unpretentiousness. I concluded, that he was hard like a coconut shell on the outside and soft as its kennel from the inside.</p>
		<p>After having met Khwaja saab (as I fondly call him), on several occasions, I found a great mentor in him; with a laser sharp focus on achieving results and a memory that precedes him, he took SCCL by the horn, to grander heights. I was humbled by his unequivocal credit to his predecessor APVN Sarma calling him ‘a bold and visionary leader’. I overheard him at times, giving a lion’s share of the success, to his teammates, who contributed to the success of the turnaround.</p>
		<p>Having been in the eye of several turnarounds myself, I unearthed that this mining company was not only different; with its hard to reach project terrain but also difficult with its Naxalite insurgency issues. For most modern day corporate leaders, cultivating the trade unions and managing harmonious industrial relations with workers is nirvana. But try taming the Naxals who use weapons instead of pens and blood instead of ink, and negotiate over dead bodies to be.</p>
		<p>In ‘The Singareni Love Story’ — the sequel to ‘The Acrobatics of Change’ — Khwaja saab narrates the adversities, fragilities and the challenges he overcame in bringing about not just a successful turnaround but a profitable one too. He goes on to explain that while for others it might be a turnaround, to him it was a romance with nature and the ‘Singarenians’, whom he bonded through his simple yet powerful mantra: “One Family; One Vision; One Mission’!</p>
		<p>There are two cores of personality – inner core and outer core. Some people appear soft externally but their heart is hard as stone. They have no concern for their people and extend little or no support. They fake smiles and pretend to be very kind and humble only to get the job at hand accomplished on time and within budget – They score well with their bosses! While there are others who appear to be hard and tough, but are very supportive and kind-hearted. They are very humane to their team members and people still like them being tough on them — They score well with their subordinates! The later is akin to a coconut – externally hard, internally soft. On Mouton and Blake’s grid they are known as 9:9 leaders – extremely demanding; extremely supporting. RH Khwaja the Union Secretary, Ministry of Tourism, belongs to this extraordinary category of ‘level 5 leadership’ — highly disciplined and tough, yet humble, kind and supportive to him team.</p>
