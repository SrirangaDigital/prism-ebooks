		<p>Albert’s father Hermann Einstein and mother Pauline Koch formerly lived in Buchau, a village in the Swabian region of south Germany. Their ancestors had been living in Germany for nearly two hundred years and by now were well assimilated into the German culture. They were mostly tradesmen and peddlers living in villages. The Einstein family was not very religious, showing little interest in rituals. Hermann had some aptitude for mathematics and managed to study in a school in Stuttgart, seventy-five miles from home.</p>
		<p>University study, however, was not affordable; so Hermann discontinued his education and took to trade. This prompted the family to move from the village to an industrial town called Ulm, thirty five miles away. Hermann’s cousin owned a featherbed company in Ulm and took him as a partner. It is here that Hermann met Pauline Koch and married her. Albert Einstein was their first child and was born in Ulm at 11:30 am on March 14, 1879, a Friday.</p>

		<p>When Einstein rose to fame, the street where his family lived was named Einsteinstrasse (Einstein Street). Subsequently, when Nazis came to power the street name was changed to Frichtestrasse. The house where the Einstein family had lived was demolished leaving no traces of the great man. However, after the fall of the Nazis, the street once again became Einsteinstrasse.</p>
		<p>Within a year after Albert’s birth, the featherbed business failed. Hermann had to look for a new job. He teamed up with his brother Jacob who owned a gas and electric company in Munich. The firm manufactured and supplied generators and lighting equipment to nearby municipalities. While Jacob provided technical expertise, Hermann took care of the business-side of the firm and also brought in the required capital through his wife who had a rich father. The family then moved to Munich.</p>
		<p>In November 1881, Hermann and Pauline had a daughter. She was named Maria, but was called Maja. Albert liked his sister immensely; in the beginning, he mistook her for a doll and asked, “Where are the wheels?” Thus began a lifelong intimate relationship between brother and sister. Albert and Maja were inseparable all their life. Maja has also written a short account of Einstein’s childhood.</p>
		<p>For nearly three years after he was born, Albert had not begun to speak and his parents were obviously worried. A doctor was consulted. However, he did talk eventually. But there was a difference; he would compose whatever he wanted to say, rehearse it mentally and then speak; besides he preferred to think not in words, but in pictures. He has said, “I very rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterwards.” He has also said, “Retarded progress worked well for me. I hardly thought as a child. I always thought as an adult.”</p>
		<p>Maja writes that young Albert hardly mixed or played with boys of his own age. He preferred to be alone, engaging in activities such as solving puzzles and constructing models with his building set. He could build a structure of fourteen floors with cards. Unlike children of his age, he disliked the military parades that passed by his house and the music that the military band played. He never bothered to run out into the street to look at these parades.</p>
		<p>He was usually calm and quiet, but sometimes exhibited fits of temper. Once he threw a chair at a tutor who had come to help with his studies; the tutor fled never to return. Sometimes Maja was also a target of his attacks!</p>

		<p>Hermann and Pauline, though of middle class, had a big house with a garden where the children could play. Hermann valued education and wanted to see Albert become an engineer.</p>
		<p>When Albert was four or five years old, he fell ill and was bedridden. Hermann gave him a compass to cheer him up. It was not just an amusement for the young boy. The compass became an inspiration to ponder over a mystery which would haunt him all through his life. The compass needle always points towards the north; but why? It has no physical connection with the earth. What pulls the needle northwards? The small boy wondered.</p>
		<p>Of course, it is the earth’s magnetism. We know that the electromagnetic field that is active all over the earth is responsible for the compass pointing northward. But that was only a starting point. Einstein spent several years studying the forces of nature and the possibility of discovering a pattern or principle that could unify them. Says Einstein later, “I can still remember, or I believe I can remember, that this experience made a deep and lasting impression on me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.”</p>

		<p>Science and technology were his father’s contribution to him. His mother contributed in her own way. She was an accomplished pianist and played in her spare time. She wanted Albert to be trained in music and so enrolled him for violin lessons. Initially he resisted but gradually began to enjoy the lessons. Mozart’s sonatas proved to be the turning point. When he was thirteen he modified his technique of playing the piano to bring out more effectively what he felt was the artistic content of Mozart’s sonatas. Later on, he greatly appreciated the compositions of Beethoven.</p>
		<p>His mother Pauline frequently accompanied him on the piano. The violin became his life-long companion, in sorrow and happiness alike. When he could not make headway in some research-related problem, he would shut himself in the kitchen (apparently because the quality of sound produced in the tiled floor of the kitchen was superior) and play his violin. During the course of playing the violin he would have an epiphany! A solution would suddenly occur! Then he would come out of the kitchen saying, “I found it.”</p>
		<p>Mozart was his all-time favourite. He says, “Mozart’s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself.” Einstein always sought harmony in the universe. He wanted his theories to reflect the harmony he found in music, nature and God. Einstein was once asked, “Science is your father’s gift to you. Is music your mother’s gift?” He replied, “I have no gift, I am passionately curious, thus it is not a question of heredity.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Schooling</h2>
			<p>Albert turned six and it was time for formal education. His parents were neither very religious nor adhered to any religious practices. Hence they did not worry that there was no Jewish school nearby. The Catholic school, Peterschule near their house seemed good enough. Albert and Maja both started their formal education here and took the standard Catholic lessons offered at school. Albert excelled in studies and would help his classmates too. He became very religious and tried to follow Jewish customs; he stopped eating pork, for example. He even composed hymns which he would sing on his way to and back from school. Einstein preserved a sense of religiousness throughout his life. A certain religiosity is necessary in the practice of science, which in reality is a pursuit of truth.</p>
			<p>By 1886, Albert was seven years old and was one of the brightest in class. What advancement from his early childhood when he could hardly speak!</p>
			<p>However, Albert liked neither the school nor the teachers. In those days German schools resembled military camps, in that strict discipline was enforced. Every classroom was a barrack and every teacher a lieutenant.</p>
			<p>When Albert was nine, he was admitted to the Luitpold Gymnasium, equivalent to a Higher Secondary School. Among other subjects he studied Greek, Latin, Geography and mathematics. He was never at ease with subjects that demanded remembering words and texts. He did not bother to remember lines from poems and plays! “You will never amount to anything,” chided his Greek teacher. However, he surprised everyone with his exam results; Albert had scored good grades in both Greek and Latin.</p>
			<img src="images/020a.jpg" alt="image"/>
			<p>Professor Ruess taught German literature and unlike other teachers he encouraged students to think and fostered in Albert a love for German literature and ancient civilizations. Einstein went to see Ruess later in life. Mistaking Einstein for a beggar, Ruess ordered him to be thrown out!</p>
			<p>Albert studied advanced physics and mathematics on his own and had mastered far beyond the syllabus prescribed in the school curriculum. He would spend days and nights trying to find solutions to challenging problems; as a young lad, friends and play-time took a backseat.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s uncle Jacob played an important role in Albert’s self-study of advanced mathematics. He taught him algebra. He compared solving an equation to hunting an animal x which is initially unknown. Only after actually hunting it down, would one be able to identify the animal. Even before he studied geometry in school, Albert had been introduced to the Pythagoras Theorem that states that the square on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. A curious school boy, he developed his own proof for the theorem!</p>

			<p>Albert’s interest in science received a further boost from a medical student called Max Talmud (who later migrated to USA and became Talmey). Jewish families followed the tradition of inviting young men pursuing theology (students generally) to dine with them once a week. This is how Albert became acquainted with Talmud. When they first met, Talmud was 21 and Albert, 10. He was surprised that Albert did not mingle with children his own age or play any sport. Talmud was responsible for expanding Albert’s intellectual horizon by introducing him to literature and philosophy. He lent him a copy of Kant’s famous Critique of Pure Reason. Kant’s work was considered incomprehensible to most ordinary mortals. But surprisingly, thirteen-year-old Albert was able to grasp the text exceedingly well. For some time, Kant was Einstein’s favourite philosopher. He pursued his interest in philosophy by reading David Hume and Ernst Mach to explore the nature of reality.</p>
			<p>Talmud shared with Albert many books on the subject of science. One such was Aaron Bernstein’s People’s Book on Natural Science, an illustrated work in 21 volumes written for the lay man. It made a huge impact on Albert. Bernstein has explored the relationship between physics and biology and has stressed the importance of experimentation in science. Einstein was particularly attracted to his discussion about the speed of light. He was so completely taken in by this phenomenon that it became a life-long obsession, culminating in his Theory of Relativity. The author proposes that electromagnetism is a wave phenomenon and so is light, and conjectures that the same may be true of gravity. We will see later that Bernstein’s scientific opinions significantly contributed towards Einstein’s theories. He remarked later, “A very good book, it has exerted a great influence on my whole development.”</p>
			<p>Talmud also gave Albert a small textbook on Euclidean geometry which influenced him in no less a measure than the compass. The book came to him two years before geometry was introduced in school. Albert called it a sacred little geometry book, and felt that there was a certain mystery in geometry. For example, the three altitudes of a triangle intersect at a point. This is not apparent or evident. But, for our young school boy the fact that this can be proved theoretically with certainty was a miracle. Says Einstein, “If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm, then you are not born to be a scientific thinker.” Talmud was surprised that Albert worked through the book within months.</p>
			<p>Albert at that tender age began to evolve a personal worldview, “It is possible to find truth by reasoning alone without the help of any outside experience.” This led him to declare later, “I became more and more convinced that nature could be understood as a relatively simple mathematical structure.”</p>
			<p>As Einstein’s experiences of the world increased, he became more and more sceptical about the stories in the Bible. It was as if youth was being deceived by lies. Out went his religious dogma. However, throughout his life he retained a reverential attitude towards the beauty and harmony in nature. He also questioned, dismissed and loathed authority in all aspects of life. Einstein’s non-conformity and contempt for power shaped his unconventional thinking and attitude. Ironically, Einstein himself became an authority later in his life. He has said, “To punish me for my contempt of authority, fate made me an authority myself.”</p>
			<p>His intelligence bloomed in school and he was a very bright student by any standard. But once again Albert did not like school; every teacher seemed to behave like a lieutenant. Albert would occupy the last benches and tease his teachers. Besides, he would ask questions for which they had no answers. Maybe the questions were too complex, beyond the grasp of mediocre minds.</p>
			<p>He openly indicated his dislike for them and the school, which annoyed the teachers. When he was in seventh grade, one of the teachers summoned him and asked him to leave the school. Albert challenged, “I have not done anything wrong. Why do you punish me like this?” The teacher replied, “Your mere presence spoils the respect of the class for me.”</p>
			<p>In 1894, his father’s factory suffered huge losses and had to be closed down. Hermann and Jacob decided to move to a town called Pavia near Milan in Italy. They did not want Albert to discontinue his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. He was boarded in a lodge so that he could continue his schooling and obtain a diploma. But Einstein was in a dilemma. Should he continue in his present school where discipline and order were enforced? Or should he move to Italy, stay with his parents and enjoy breathtaking views of nature? The latter seemed better. However, it was not easy to quit school and move away.</p>
			<p>Albert planned his next move meticulously. First of all, he was determined to give up his German citizenship as he felt it futile to stay in a country which prepared students primarily for a military life. He wanted to acquire Swiss citizenship. Now that he had crossed the age of fifteen, he realised that if he stayed there till he turned seventeen, he would then have to serve in the German army. He was certain he didn’t want to do so.</p>
			<p>In preparation to move to Swiss, Albert first met a doctor (actually, Talmud’s brother) and persuaded him to certify that he was of poor mental condition, and advise that he should join his parents to recuperate. Next, he managed to get a testimonial from his mathematics teacher stating that he was exceptionally good in mathematics and that he was competent for the demands of university education.</p>
			<p>With these two certificates in his pocket, Albert joined his parents in Italy. In effect, he had taken charge of his future. His ambition was to seek education in a Swiss university. But he was a school dropout with no diploma. So he convinced his parents that he would prepare on his own for the entrance examination.</p>
			<p>It was a sudden release from tyranny for Albert; there was no school, no teacher; none to enforce discipline, rules and regulations. He was free to do what he wanted. Albert studied physics, his favourite subject. He became absorbed in an advanced textbook to such an extent that he would sit on a sofa with a pencil and paper for hours on end. He even wrote a paper on Magnetic Field, which of course made little impact.</p>
			<p>He had now befriended Otto Neustatter and the duo hiked through the Apennine Mountains and to Genoa. En route, they visited museums, churches, art treasures and attended concerts. They were voracious readers. Italians seemed more warm-hearted than Germans. During this period he had occasion to closely observe the proceedings and processes at the factory run by his father and uncle, and gain firsthand knowledge of how magnets, generators and coils worked. He even helped his uncle with calculations.</p>
			<p>Hermann’s business went through many ups and downs. Albert felt obliged to support his family financially. But he was unwilling to forgo studies to earn a livelihood. Besides, he felt confident and well-prepared for the entrance examination to the Zurich Polytechnic. There was one drawback. Albert was too young and had to wait two years to take the examination. A relative of the family wrote to the director of the Polytechnic stating that Albert was an exceptional candidate and a prodigy, and requested that he be allowed to take the examination. Permission was granted.</p>
			<p>Albert sat the examination but failed in French, politics, zoology and botany. However, he had performed exceedingly well in science and mathematics. Prof. Heinrich Weber at the Zurich Polytechnic appreciated Albert’s performance in physics and took pity on him. He summoned Albert and permitted him to attend his lectures in physics. The Director of Zurich Polytechnic, Albin Herzog advised Albert that he would stand a good chance of clearing the polytechnic entrance test, if he first studied at the Swiss Cantonal School in the town of Aarau and earned a diploma.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Aarau</h2>
			<p>The Swiss Cantonal School was modelled after the philosophy of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, an educational reformer, who conceived a revolutionary and modern view of education. He preached learning by ‘head, hand and heart’ and learning by visualising, which was ideal for a free-thinking creative student like Albert. Unlike German schools, here every student was respected. Students learnt by observation and experimentation rather than by mere reading or by rote. Naturally, students were more relaxed; there was no authority demanding respect and instilling fear. Where fear is absent, respect comes naturally.</p>
			<p>He had been inspired by Bernstein’s book on natural science. Albert often wondered, ‘what will the world look like if I ride a beam of light?’ Such thought experiments were Einstein’s favourite pastime.</p>

			<p>Albert met the Wintelers family and fostered an everlasting relationship with them. Jost Winteler taught Greek and history at Aarau. The Wintelers had seven children. Later, Einstein’s sister Maja married Winteler’s son Paul, and Albert himself fell in love with Marie, Winteler’s daughter. Another of Winteler’s daughters, Anna, married Einstein’s friend Michele Angelo Besso. Winteler, like Einstein hated the nationalism and militarism that prevailed in Germany and preferred to be a citizen of the world. Hence, Albert’s dislike for such jingoism was further strengthened.</p>
			<p>Marie Winteler was 18 and Albert, 16 when they first met. She had completed a course in teaching and was looking for a job. They developed mutual admiration and exchanged letters. Albert’s mother approved the friendship. But, the relationship was short-lived.</p>
			<p>Albert had been asked to improve his knowledge of chemistry and French. He did so reluctantly. But music received his undivided attention. His music teacher felt he was the best in class. Listening to him play the violin, one of his friends asked, “Do you count beats?” Albert replied, “No, it is in my blood.”</p>
			<p>In 1896, with his father’s approval Albert renounced his German citizenship. It is interesting that Albert mentioned in his application that he had no religious denomination.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>One year of study at Aarau ended very well. Albert stood second in class in the annual examinations. We do not know who topped the class. Albert scored 5 or 6 out of 6 in all subjects except French in which he scored only 3. In his French examination, he had to write an essay about his ambitions. He expressed his desire to join the Zurich Polytechnic, study physics and become a teacher and his aptitude for abstract and mathematical thinking. Entry to the Zurich Polytechnic was well within his grasp now.</p>
			<p>It is popularly believed that Einstein failed in mathematics in high school. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Somehow, this myth has spread and prevailed. When Einstein was shown a newspaper report stating the same, he laughed and said, “How could this be? By the age of fifteen I had finished reading calculus!”</p>
			<p>In 1896, the partnership between Hermann and Jacob was dissolved. Jacob decided to join an engineering establishment as a paid employee. Hermann continued with the electrical engineering company hoping that Albert would study engineering and support him in his business someday. This was not to be. Albert was after physics which meant that he would seek an academic position.</p>
