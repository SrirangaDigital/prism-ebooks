		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Divorce</h1>
		<p>We have seen that Einstein did not want to completely sever ties with Mileva although he was now separated from her. He was not prepared to marry Elsa even though she and her family pressed him to do so. But eventually, he yielded to Elsa’s pressure and pleaded Mileva for a divorce. In his letter to her in this regard, strangely enough, he asked her to take care of the children and also to monitor their calcium levels. Mileva refused to budge at first. But then, Einstein begged saying that he had to marry Elsa to put an end to public gossip. Almost as a bribe, he offered to increase the funds he was providing her. At the same time, he asked that the children be sent to Berlin as he wanted to see them. Mileva did not consent to any of the minor requests, but agreed to start the divorce proceedings.</p>
		<p>Mileva had another mental breakdown and was bedridden. Hans and Eduard were sent to live with Besso in Zurich and subsequently to Mileva’s friend Savic in Lausanne. The situation worsened. Mileva was admitted to a sanatorium. Einstein was not moved. He did not think it necessary to visit Mileva or his children. He remained absorbed in physics!</p>
		<p>However, it was not easy for him to ignore his children. He wrote to his friend – if she dies I will take care of them and bring them up very well. He had his own plans of how he would raise them. At one point of time, he even wrote to Hans describing his fantasies about raising him and his brother. Obviously angry, Hans did not reply. However, he wrote to his father much later to announce that mother was back home from the sanatorium and that the boys were having a nice time with her.</p>
		<p>It was during this tumultuous time that Einstein wrote a formal description of his General Theory as the popular book, Relativity: The Special and The General Theory. It appears that he read every page of it to Elsa’s eighteen year old daughter Margot just to make sure the book was understood by the average person. One wonders whether the book is really so easy to follow, leave alone for laypersons, even for scientists!</p>
		<p>When life posed a problem, science gave him the shelter and refuge required. It was as if the diurnal happenings did not bother him in the least. Only science mattered. All other things he could ignore. He made it explicit in his speech delivered on the sixtieth birthday of Max Planck – “One of the strongest motives that leads men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness. Such men make this cosmos and its construction the pivot of their emotional life in order to find peace and security which they cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.” Perhaps, this is a fitting description of Einstein himself. No doubt, this was drawn from his personal experience.</p>
		<p>It was 1917. Einstein was 38. He developed a stomach pain. He did not pay much attention to it. He stated, philosophically, “My task of developing the Theory of Relativity is complete. It is okay if I die.” But his friend Freundlich would not let him suffer. He compelled Einstein to see a doctor. It was found that his sickness was due to malnutrition, a common ailment in Germany due to food shortage resulting from the war. Einstein was placed on a diet of rice, macaroni and Zwieback (a type of crisp, sweetened bread, made with eggs and baked twice).</p>
		<p>Living all alone, it was difficult to adhere to this diet. His friend Zangger sent supplies from Zurich. In spite of it, Einstein lost 22 kilograms in just two months. Elsa was concerned. She rented an apartment close to hers and requested him to shift so she could take care of him. Now, Einstein followed a diet of eggs, bread of his choice and butter, all very scarce during wartime. Elsa was rich. She even bought him cigars, an expensive luxury in those war-ravaged times! Now, with Elsa living nearby the two met almost every day. She nursed him very well.</p>
		<p>Matters became worse when Eduard became sick again, this time with a lung inflammation. Einstein even felt that it was better for Eduard to die than lead a life debilitated by illness. He travelled to Zurich to take care of the boy’s medical needs. He admitted Eduard to a sanatorium in Arosa. Hans’ sympathy for his father suffering from stomach pain, improved their relationship. A sum of 1500 crowns, he received from the academy in Vienna for a lecture, helped Einstein pay Eduard’s medical bills.</p>
		<p>Now that they met every day, it was easier for Elsa to persuade Einstein to divorce Mileva and marry her. Einstein, tuned to a divorce, sent word to Mileva. He promised her 9000 Marks of which 2000 would go to a future fund for the children’s benefit.</p>
		<p>He came up with another masterstroke. It was evident that sooner or later he would be awarded the Nobel Prize. He offered the entire money to Mileva. Those days, the prize money was 225,000 marks; Mileva would have to wait 37 years to make such an amount of money! Further, it would be given in the Swedish currency which was more stable than the German mark.</p>
		<p>Mileva reviewed her situation. Her health was bad, Eduard was still in the sanatorium; her sister who helped her, had been admitted to a sanatorium and her brother, a soldier, had been captured by the Russians. Really, she would be a fool not to accept such an offer. She informed Einstein, “I accept this offer. I do not want to stand in the way of your happiness.” However, she demanded that she be allowed to retain her name as Mrs. Einstein!</p>
		<p>Paper work and deliberations started and it was a long-drawn affair. Einstein remarked, “We have to see whether the war will end before I get my divorce!” Mileva felt that Elsa was siphoning all the money from her husband, which was not true. However, the hypothetical question remained – Will Einstein pay compensation if he was not awarded the Nobel Prize? An amicable settlement was reached in the end.</p>
		<p>Einstein attraction for Elsa only grew stronger by the day. In his vacation of 1918, he preferred to be with her than visit his children. They spent time at a resort near the Baltic Sea, Einstein reading and pondering over quantum mechanics. He was glad to be away from visitors and telephone calls. His food had to be specially prepared and he entertained very few friends. He wrote a letter of apology to Hans stating that a detour to Zurich to visit him would be very difficult. He, however encouraged Hans to pursue his ambitions and kept him abreast of developments in science.</p>
		<p>At this juncture, Einstein was offered a position jointly by the Zurich Polytechnic and the University. He was free to decide what he would do. As can be expected, Elsa was not in favour of moving to Zurich. Furthermore, Einstein himself dreaded the fireworks that would result if Mileva and Elsa were in proximity. Einstein rejected the offer.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Verification of the General Theory</h2>
			<p>Any theory, however grand it is, is worth nothing till it is experimentally verified - theory guides and experiment decides. That was the status of the Theory of Relativity to start with. One of the predictions that could be verified was that light from a distant star deflects as it nears the sun.</p>

			<p>In 1914, Erwin Freundlich an astronomer from Berlin wanted to experiment and verify the deflection of light. This experiment had to be performed only during a total solar eclipse when sunlight is completely blocked from vision on earth. On any other day, observing distant starts was impossible due to the sun’s brightness. One such eclipse occurred in Crimea in Russia on August 21, 1914. Freundlich set out to test the theory. Einstein encouraged him and arrangements started almost a year ahead.</p>
			<p>An interesting incident occurred in 1913 when Freundlich took his wife to see Einstein in the mountains near Zurich. Einstein met them at the train station and took them and some of his assistants for lunch to a restaurant. Not unusually, Einstein had forgotten to bring any money. Luckily, an assistant slipped a 100 franc note under the table for Einstein to pay the bill. Later, Einstein promised Freundlich 2000 marks towards his expedition if required.</p>
			<p>As Freundlich and others were travelling towards Crimea, war broke out. The members of the expedition were captured by the Russian army. Their equipment was confiscated. Besides, the weather on the chosen day turned cloudy making any observation impossible.</p>
			<p>Lucky for science, Freundlich was not successful. At that point of time there was an error in the theory. The extent of deflection of light calculated by Einstein was short by half the actual amount.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">England vs Germany</h2>
			<p>Communication among scientists proved very difficult because of the war. Einstein’s theory took some time to reach other countries. Holland was neutral and allowed information exchange. The Dutch astronomer William de Sitter in Leiden managed to send the paper on the General Theory of Relativity across to Arthur Eddington, a British astronomer in Cambridge, England. Eddington exclaimed at once, “Whether the theory proves to be correct or not, it claims attention as being one of the most beautiful examples of general mathematical reasoning.”</p>

			</figure>
			<p>A total solar eclipse was to occur on May 29, 1919 in the village of Sobral in the Amazon jungle in Brazil and at Principe, a small Portuguese island off the west coast of Africa. Eddington teamed with Frank Dyson and managed to procure government funding for two expeditions, one each to Sobral and Principe. The purpose of the mission was to test Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.</p>
			<p>Funds were granted, and the war ended; there was no obstacle to travel. Eddington took charge of the observations at Principe. The eclipse started at 3:13 pm and lasted less than five minutes. There was some anxiety as rain poured down all morning. However, towards the afternoon it subsided. Eddington was busy changing the film in the camera and simultaneously keeping watch over the sky. He hardly watched the eclipse as he took sixteen pictures. Eddington was happy that observations could be carried out. The captured pictures had to still be analysed. Weather in Sobral was more cooperative.</p>
			<p>The question was whether the deflection would be 0.85 seconds of arc as the English scientist Isaac Newton’s theory had predicted or 1.7 seconds of arc as the German scientist Albert Einstein had predicted. Eddington measured an average deflection of 1.7 seconds of arc! Eddington felt it was his personal victory. The measurements made by the other British party in Brazil had to be discarded as the equipment was found to be faulty.</p>
			<p>Einstein was aware of the Eddington expedition. Eddington informed Lorentz in Leiden who, in turn, cabled Einstein on October 22, 1919 and conveyed the good news.</p>
			<p>Einstein was sure that the outcome would be positive. He informed his mother, “Lorentz has telegraphed me that the British expeditions have verified the deflection of light by the sun.”</p>
			<p>Another incident is often quoted. Einstein was with his student Ilse Schneider when the telegram arrived. “This may interest you”, he said and handed the telegram to her. Reading it, Ilse felt like dancing; she was excited. But he remained calm, and said, "I knew my theory was correct."</p>
			<p>“What would you have done if the experiments had proved that your theory was wrong?”</p>
			<p>“I would have been sorry for the dear Lord. My theory is correct!”</p>
			<p>After this, Eddington also rose to a new height. At one point it was thought that only three men in the world understood Relativity. When asked about this, Eddington remarked, “I wonder who the third one is!”</p>
			<p>Einstein celebrated his success by buying a new violin.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Is he a German or a Swiss Jew?</h2>
			<p>Einstein was hated by the Germans for he was a Swiss Jew. Dislike towards him was very strong in England where he was regarded as a German. He was nominated for the prestigious gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1920. But a group of patriotic British protested and garnered enough votes in their favour and prevented the award from being given to Einstein. However, respect towards Einstein increased in the coming years; he was awarded the medal in 1926, which he graciously accepted.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein – A Social Democrat</h2>
			<p>Germany lost the war which ended in November 1918. The Kaiser abdicated the throne; a republican government came to power. Einstein was compelled to come out of his scientific shell and speak his mind. There was a general strike in Germany and students boycotted lectures in universities across the nation. On November 8, the Worker-Student Revolutionary Council took over the University of Berlin and arrested the deans and the rector. It was an exhibition of nationalism and pro-German feelings. Against this background, Einstein was definitely an internationalist.</p>
			<p>Einstein thought that it was time to act as per his conscience and work towards releasing the deans and the rector. He telephoned Max Born, a fellow physicist, asking him to cooperate. Though he was down with flu, Max Born agreed to join him. He also invited Walt Wertheimer, a physiologist. The three took a train to Reichstag where students were rallying. The assembled mob recognised Einstein and led him to a room where the committee was in meeting to formulate new regulations for the university. Einstein was asked to comment. He was dauntless and spoke for the academic freedom of the university. He opined that professors are not to be told what to teach and students must have the freedom to choose their subject of study. Einstein warned that the new regulations would curtail the freedom of the universities. However, students did not release the deans and the rector claiming lack of authority to do so.</p>
			<p>Thus Einstein and his friends approached the new German president who readily ordered their release.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Elsa is Mrs Einstein</h2>
			<p>Einstein was granted divorce by a court in Zurich on February 14, 1919. Nothing now prevented him from marrying Elsa. The two married in June 1919. Soon after, he went to Zurich to spend time with his children and took them sailing. He also entertained them with music and science projects such as model building.</p>
			<p>One can easily guess that this was not a marriage of two brains. Elsa was little interested in science. She would say, “Relativity is not essential for my happiness. Mathematics is necessary only to follow house hold bills”. She was more a mother than a wife to him. Her fluency in French and English allowed her to serve as interpreter to her husband during overseas visits. Everything in Einstein’s non-scientific life became Elsa’s concerns. She would take care of what he ate and how he dressed (not that he obeyed her orders in this). She kept his room and made his bed. When it came to travel, she packed his suitcase and ensured he carried enough money for the travel. Of course, she enjoyed being the wife of a great scientist, sharing all the glory and honour that came with it.</p>
			<p>Elsa made sure that Einstein’s working atmosphere was calm and undisturbed. She would bring him from his study down to the dining room to eat a meal of sausages and soup. Sometimes, he would be so engrossed in work, he could not be budged. Then Elsa would serve his meal in his study. When Einstein grumbled about eating, she cautioned him, “People have centuries to discover things, but your stomach will not wait for centuries.” When he was more relaxed, he would come down from his study and take Elsa and her daughters for a walk. Always, the suggestion to go out had to come from him, not the other way around.</p>
			<p>Einstein and Elsa lived in an apartment with Ilse and Margot. It was tastefully furnished with green wallpaper and white linen with lace embroidery. The study was a large room in the attic with a big window. Pictures of Newton, Maxwell and Faraday decorated the walls.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Ilse married Rudolf Kayser, the editor of a literary magazine in Germany while Margot, who became a sculptor, married Dimitri Marianoff, a Russian.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Fame travels at speed of light</h2>
			<p>No sooner had the Royal Society of England hailed Einstein as the new star of physics, than the media worked overtime garnering and publishing as much news about him and his discoveries as possible. Americans also joined the bandwagon of admirers. “Revolution in science, Newtonian ideas overthrown”, “Epoch Making” and “Einstein Theory Triumphs”, were some headlines that made their way into the newspapers. The press brought out special editions to explain R Relativity. Numerous interviews with Einstein were published. The book penned by Einstein was published in English. Sales of the book sky rocketed. Publishers who struggled to understand the concept of Relativity requested Einstein to write a short synopsis that could be used for promotional purposes.</p>
			<p>His colleagues Eddington, Max Born, Von Lue, Planck and Freundlich were compelled to give public lectures on Relativity, many times to capacity crowds. When Einstein’s student Leopald Infeld lectured in Poland, in spite of it being a cold night, the crowd could not be accommodated in the biggest hall in town. At Eddington’s speech in Cambridge, hundreds assembled, and hundreds were sent back due to shortage of seats. It was as if a blockbuster had been released; people had to see it on the first day.</p>
			<p>The press pressured Einstein to write another book, and the result was the classic, What is Relativity? Bertrand Russell wrote ABC of Relativity. Einstein’s colleagues too wrote books on Relativity. Six hundred books and articles appeared on Relativity within the first six years!</p>
			<p>That begs the question, Was Einstein really as averse to publicity as popularly believed? All the evidence suggests otherwise. He gave interviews; he wrote popular books; he even appeared with Charlie Chaplin. “There was a streak in him that enjoyed the photographers and the crowd,” says C P Snow, a chemist, who excelled as a science writer and novelist. He continues, “He had an element of the exhibitionist and the ham. If there had not been that element, there would have been no photographers and no crowds. Nothing is easier to avoid than publicity. If one genuinely does not want to get it, one does not get it.” In the words of American writer and biographer, Walter Isaacson, “Einstein performed. He gave interviews readily, peppered them with delightful aphorisms, and knew exactly what made for a good story.”</p>
			<p>Elsa was no different. She liked attention. She even charged money when people took pictures of him; however, she donated the money to charity.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The first Idea of a Bomb</h2>
			<p>Einstein travelled to Prague, where he had worked a few years before. He wanted to be away from public glare and get some quiet time. He stayed with Philipp Frank and his wife who lived in a small room in the physics laboratory (where Einstein used to work). He had to sleep on the sofa. At a small reception given to him by the department, instead of delivering a lecture, he played a sonata by Mozart.</p>
			<p>While Einstein was in Prague, a young gentleman met him and produced a piece of paper. He had shown that on the basis of the equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, energy contained in an atom can be released to produce explosives. Einstein branded the concept foolish and dismissed the young man. If only he had listened to him patiently! It is now history that the same foolish idea led indirectly to the making of the atomic bomb!</p>
			<p>From Prague, Einstein went to Vienna where a crowd of three thousand scientists waited to hear him speak. The host was to meet him at the train station. He checked the first class car; no trace of Einstein. He checked the second class car; still no trace of him. But there he was, the world renowned scientist at the end of the platform emerging from a third class car with a violin in his hand, like a street musician!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Relativity and Philosophy</h2>
			<p>Space is relative, time is relative. There is nothing which is absolute, said Einstein. Relativity for him was nothing more than a scientific theory, with particular relevance in physics. But the world around was so overwhelmed by the incessant media coverage and Einstein’s numerous appearances that the concept began to be generalised and applied to all areas of human activity, be it art, literature, philosophy or even sociology. Absolute does not exist; everything is relative, became the new mantra. The idea seemed novel and Einstein’s name crossed the boundary of science. However, he did not approve or like it.</p>
			<p>Lord Haldane, a British statesman, was a scholar in science and philosophy. He wrote the book Reign of Relativity and tried to show that Relativity exists outside the realm of science. Haldane invited Einstein to London in 1921. A dinner was hosted in his honour and eminent people from various fields, such as George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Eddington, the Archbishop of Canterbury were invited. Seated next to Einstein, the archbishop expressed concerns about the ramifications that Relativity might have on religion. Einstein replied plainly, “Relativity is a purely scientific matter and has nothing to do with religion.”</p>
