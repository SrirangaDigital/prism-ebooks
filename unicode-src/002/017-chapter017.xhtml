		<p>During his last days Einstein was plagued by stomach related ailments and anaemia. But he was aware that the aneurysm in his aorta could end his life any moment. He felt that human existence was brief like a fleeting visit to a strange house; similar to the Indian philosophical perception of life. He kept contact with Habicht and Solovine, erstwhile members of the Olympia Academy. He took walks with Godel sometimes and with Margot at other times. Margot observed that he had mellowed down and that his judgement had turned mild. He became very friendly with Hans Albert and exchanged letters with him.</p>
		<p>He remained a good friend of Bertrand Russell. The two agreed to come up with a public declaration urging countries to find peaceful means to resolve all matters of dispute. Nine other scientists including Max Born agreed to be a part of the drafting committee. The declaration called the Einstein-Russell declaration was ready by April 11 , 1955 and Einstein signed it.</p>
		<p>His academic life continued and he clung to his passion – unified field theory. His friends and other great scientists of the time laughed at him. They knew very well that he would not succeed. But he would not give up. His assistant Bruria Kaufman, a physicist from Israel would fill the blackboard with equations as per Einstein’s latest thinking, only to wipe it out clean.</p>
		<p>Johanna Fantova was his companion now; she has recorded many of his day to day activities and thoughts. The two shared a very good friendship for nearly twenty five years.</p>
		<p>He celebrated his seventy-sixth birthday. Soon after, his closest friend for sixty years Michele Angelo Besso died. Lamented Einstein, “For us the physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion.”</p>
		<p>After signing the Einstein-Russell declaration he received the Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban at 112, Mercer Street. Einstein was to deliver an address over radio to the people of Israel on the seventh anniversary of the formation of Israel. He made coffee for Eban and told him that the real test of Israeli people is in how they treat the Arabs.</p>
		<p>Two days later, at noon, Einstein collapsed in the bathroom. His aneurysm perhaps had started to rupture. The doctors suggested surgery. He refused any attempts to prolong his life. His situation worsened in the following days and he had to be admitted to the hospital. He would wake up and ask Helen Dukas to fetch him paper, pencil and his glasses. He talked to Hans Albert who had flown down from California. Showing his equations he remarked, “If only I had more mathematics!” He talked to Otto Nathan (a German refugee and a close friend) about Germany. One of the last to see him alive was Margot who also happened to be admitted in the adjacent ward, in the same hospital. She said that it was indeed impossible to recognise him; his appearance had changed so much. He, it seemed, was ready for death. He told her, “I have accomplished what I came to do here.”</p>
		<p>His death came shortly after one O’ clock in the morning of Monday, April 18, 1955, at the age of 76. Apparently, he said something in German before dying. The nurses could not decipher it. At his bedside were two documents. One was the speech he was to deliver on radio for Israel which began thus: “Today I speak to you not as an American citizen, not as a Jew, but as a human being.” The other was a bunch of twelve pages of equations related to the Unified Theory. What he left at his bedside when he died, was symbolic of what he stood for in his life.</p>
		<p>He was cremated the same afternoon even before most of the world came to know of his death. He had wished for a simple cremation and only twelve people including Hans Albert and Helen Dukas were present at the funeral ceremony in Trenton. Further Einstein had wished that no memorial be built for him and that his ashes be dispersed in the River Delaware. He was sure that if his ashes were retained, they would be stored in someplace, which itself would become a memorial. But the following words are in fact a memorial to him.</p>
		<p>Dear Posterity,</p>
		<p>If you have not become more just, more peaceful and generally more rational than we are (were) – why then, the Devil take you. Having, with all respect, given utterance to this pious wish,</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">What was in his brain?</h2>
			<p>A formal autopsy was conducted by Dr. Harvey. Suspecting that there was something special in his brain, Dr. Harvey cut open Einstein’s skull and took the brain out, apparently for research. Hans Albert tried to complain in vain. For Dr. Harvey, this was a once in a life time opportunity; he would not desist.</p>
			<p>Dr. Harvey preserved Einstein’s brain till 1998. By then he had taken many slices of the brain and supplied them to various hospitals for further research. Nothing positive has come out of this endeavour. One person who expected some good result was Evelyn Einstein. It may be recollected that at Einstein’s suggestion Hans Albert had adopted her. She had grave suspicions that she was indeed Einstein’s own daughter. In fact, following Elsa’s death Einstein had relationships with many women and it is alleged that she was born out of one such liaison with a New York dancer. Evelyn had hoped that a DNA analysis would solve the riddle. But to her disappointment, the manner in which Dr. Harvey had mangled the brain, it was impossible to extract DNA from it.</p>
			<p>It was thus a futile exercise. To put it in the words of Jürgen Neffe,“The key to understanding Einstein lies not in biology but in biography.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Helen Dukas</h2>
			<p>Helen Dukas was Einstein’s secretary from April 13, 1928 till his death. She managed all his correspondence. Einstein used to joke, “She is the one that tells the world that I am living. She writes all my letters.” She shielded Einstein from journalists. After Elsa died, Helen Dukas became his house keeper and cook. Following Einstein’s death, she ensured that almost all of the 42,000 items belonging to him in the form of papers, letters, passports and certificates were preserved for posterity. Einstein had left her his personal belongings and $20,000. He had also left for her a fraction of the royalties he received for his writings. She lived in 112, Mercer Street till her death in 1982, at the age of 87. Otto Nathan remarked, “Einstein died for a second time.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Preserving the documents</h2>
			<p>Whatever Helen Dukas preserved is now a property of the Princeton University Press.</p>
			<p>The library at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem holds about 80,000 items including letters, memos, sketches, drafts, manuscripts and rough calculations. The California Institute of Technology also holds a number of similar items.</p>
			<p>The Einstein Museum in Bern is indeed a treasure trove. It exhibits Einstein’s papers and letters, and books that influenced him. Animated representations of his theories for the common man are very interesting. His apartment in Bern has been converted into a museum and it houses many photographs.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Who knew Einstein personally?</h2>
			<p>This is a very interesting question. The book My Einstein edited by John Brockman contains the writings of many modern scientists on Einstein. The one by Lee Smolin is particularly interesting for it shows how elusive Einstein the person was, even to people who were very closely associated with him. He was a post doctorate fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. Smolin made an attempt to discover Einstein, the person. He met a number of people and asked them – What was Einstein like as a person? The replies were absolutely puzzling. The great physicist Freeman Dyson said, “I am very sorry, but that’s one thing I can’t help you with.” Einstein’s biographer, Abraham Pais did not give an answer to this question, but introduced Smolin to Helen Dukas. She said, “Can’t help you. I was just the secretary. I only typed the papers.” Nor could Peter Bergmann, one of Einstein’s assistants, be of any help. Smolin never found out who Einstein was!</p>
			<p>That is the mystery of the man. He was associated with hundreds of people, but he was detached from them. He does not seem to have engaged himself emotionally with anybody. Elsa and his mother Pauline perhaps were the exceptions. “He did not like to be constricted and he could be cold to members of his family”, writes Walter Isaacson. His own collaborator Leopald Infeld says, “His heart never bleeds and he moves through life with mild enjoyment and emotional indifference. His extreme kindness and decency are thoroughly impersonal and seem to come from another planet.” In the words of Max Born, “For all his kindness, sociability and love of humanity, he was nevertheless totally detached from his environment and the human beings in it.” Perhaps it was this attitude that helped him undertake adventures in science and fight till his goal was reached. In fact Einstein himself confesses, “Man is at one and the same time a solitary being and a social being.”</p>
