		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>n the above said five disciplines of purification of soul, three of them are something we commonly practice: i) Family ii) Livelihood or Employment iii) Following of Religion. These three things have come commonly from ancient time. If not through wisdom but with blind faith they have been observed. The other two things that are not in practice are: i) Study of Literature or Review of Works ii) Service to Society.</p>
		<p>As the level of literacy is growing in recent times if not for earning wisdom or knowledge they are doing it for sake of getting entertained.</p>
		<p>But, the service to society is highly neglected and has taken a back seat. This society is the important school of teaching morals. The purification and molding the soul receives in this is very enriching and is also essential for the progress of nation. It is also the foundation for democratic state.</p>
