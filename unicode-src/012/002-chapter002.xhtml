		<img src="images/005.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>Before we get started we need to know, “What exactly is energy” as defined in Physics.</p>
		<p>Open any text book and you will find energy being defined as, “the capacity to do work.” It is right but it does not tell the whole story. What we are going to recount in this chapter may seem somewhat elementary to some of you. But a quick revision of the basic concepts may be useful.</p>
		<p>Let us first understand the exact differences between what are called</p>
		<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Force</li>
			<li>Power</li>
			<li>Energy, through a poem.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="text-center"><em>You should know of course,</em><br /> <em>What is FORCE,</em><br /> <em>It is mass times acceleration;</em><br /> <em>While force times speed </em><br /> <em>Is POWER indeed,</em><br /> <em>You need more of it</em><br /> <em>The faster you run.</em><br /> <em>If you take for instance,</em><br /> <em>Force times distance</em><br /> <em>It is ENERGY or WORK DONE………</em></p>
		<p>Distance is often measured in metres and time in seconds. Velocity is metres per second and acceleration is rate of change of velocity or change of velocity per second. We can write:</p>
		<p>Force = mass &#215; acceleration  Power = Force &#215; velocity</p>
		<p>Energy = Work done = Force &#215; distance</p>

		<p>Let us not forget that all these were defined by Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>
		<p>Energy does not have to take the form of motion only. It takes the form of motion, heat, light, sound, electricity and also has chemical form. Energy often transforms from one form to another. Burn a candle, the chemical energy stored in the wax of the candle, turns into light energy and heat energy. If you burn a candle and the candle lasts for say one hour, the same candle cut into two equal halves will give twice as much light or power but will last only half an hour. Cut into four identical pieces, the candle will give four times as much light or power but will last only a quarter of an hour.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>1 power &#215; 1 hour</td>
				<td>= 2 power &#215; 1/2 hour</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>= 4 power &#215; 1/4 hour</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>= Energy stored in the candle.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>So, “<em>Energy is power multiplied by hour</em>” (by hour we mean time)</p>
		<p>You can check for yourself a case of energy transformation. Rub your hands. The process of rubbing is mechanical work. You will soon feel that your palms feel warm. The energy stored in your muscles is chemical energy which helps you to do mechanical work which is converted into heat energy. Hit a drum. Chemical energy changes to Mechanical energy which changes into Sound energy. You can think of many such instances of energy changes or transformations.</p>
		<p>If a big book kept on your table falls on your foot, it hurts. Does the book have any energy? It does not. When you lift it from the floor and place it on the table, you spend energy or do some work to lift the book. That energy is stored in the book as <em>Potential energy.</em></p>

		<p>If a stone from an old monument, say the Qutb Minar in Delhi (1199 AD) falls on the tin roof of a shed below, it will make a big noise and also make a dent on the tin. Where does the energy come from? You will be surprised to learn that the energy spent by the masons who climbed up more than 800 years ago to place the stone on top of the Monument is still stored as <em>Potential energy</em> and manifests itself as <em>Kinetic energy</em> as it keeps falling on gravitational pull. As the stone hits the tin, it stops and gives up its Kinetic energy as sound and as mechanical energy in making a dent on the tin. After 800 years? You will be more surprised to learn that the energy from the candle that you light now came to our planet millions of years ago as light from the Sun and was stored in the oil that we extract from under the ground. Wax comes from this oil. This sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
