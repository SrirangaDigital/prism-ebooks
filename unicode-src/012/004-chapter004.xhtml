		<img src="images/011.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>It was about 4.54 billion years ago when our sun had thrown out some of its extra ‘junk’, some heavy metals, parts of which became asteroids and got lost in space, and some coalesced and became planets. Our earth was one such planet, spinning rather slowly round an axis vertical to the plane of its orbital path, when a ‘rogue’ celestial body, almost as large as the Mars, is believed to have crashed in or grazed past it. A part of the mass of the earth was shorn off to become the moon. The axis of rotation of the earth got tilted by 23.5 degrees and the earth began to spin faster, taking a little over 24 hours to make one rotation. A simple celestial accident but what a difference has it made to us, the earthlings!</p>

		<p>Seasonal variations happen because of the earth’s tilt. In the northern hemisphere the days become longer than nights from June till August. The sun is directly overhead on the tropic of Cancer, passing almost over Kolkata. The heat received is more direct and intense. Besides, the high solar flux received during longer days cannot be dissipated during shorter nights. We have summer. During the same period the nights are longer in the southern hemisphere. The solar flux received during the day is inclined and less intense, having to travel through more of the atmosphere for a shorter duration and dissipated during longer nights. In the southern hemisphere it is winter.</p>

		<p>Just the opposite happens to the northern hemisphere during December to February and we have winter while the southerners have summer. September through November, days and nights are almost equal in both hemispheres. So are March, April and May, the lovely months of spring when trees burst into blossoms. But think of the Eskimos. For six months during summer in the Northern Hemisphere the sun does not set and for six months during our winter the sun does not rise. The Arctic and the Antarctic are permanently ice bound.</p>
		<p>Had the earth not got tilted we would have eternal spring. Would it not be boring? Would that be an energy saver since we would not have to spend energy cooling ourselves during summer months and warming ourselves during winter months, as we do now? A difficult question since we don’t know whether we would be there at all or be like as we are now.</p>
		<p>If there was no crash perhaps we would not have the moon to softly light up our nights reflecting sunlight. The gravitational pull between the earth and the moon which we shall talk about later, would not be there to give rise to the ocean tides.</p>
		<p>Be it summer, winter or spring, heat from the sun keeps our planet warm when the temperature in the outer space is about -50&#9900;C. As we go higher up from the sea level, it gets cooler. You must have seen the pictures of the peaks on the Himalayas. They are always covered by snow. Those of you who have been on an aeroplane would have heard announcements on how cold it is outside.</p>
		<p>Why should life exist on the earth and not on other planets in the solar system? It is an interesting question to ask but difficult to answer. In this universe, with billions of stars and planets separated by millions of light years (one light year is 9,4500000,000000 km), there may be life elsewhere but we know almost for certain that life as we know, does not exist in other planets of our solar system, not even in the Mars, the closest possible candidate for harbouring life. The earth is not too far away from the sun to be a frozen mass and not too close to be boiling hot. Our temperatures are just right for biochemical reactions to occur, leading to life. Water and oxygen are essential ingredients for life. We have both in abundance. At higher temperatures seas and oceans would evaporate and at lower temperatures they would freeze.</p>
		<p>We seem to have the right combinations of every thing in this planet and that is why we are here.</p>
		<p>Isn’t that fantastic!</p>
