		<p>Let us get to know something about the inside of our earth. It would help to learn about volcanoes which throw up some of the inner contents of the earth.</p>
		<p>Pompeii. A prosperous town in Naples, south of Italy. It was possibly an autumn morning in 79 A.D., when a tremor shook the people up from slumber. The sky had turned grey. A column of smoke was rising like a huge tree with branches from the mount Vesuvius. This was followed by a stream of molten lava. The volcanic eruption continued for almost two days. Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town close by, were buried under volcanic ash and mud and lost for centuries, until they were discovered in 1748.</p>

		<p>The last eruption of the mount Vesuvius occurred in the year 1944. There are many such volcanoes spread all over the world. Some are dead and some are still active. Fujiama in Japan is a beautiful volcano which is probably dead. What are volcanoes and what is lava?</p>

		<p>After years of studying the vibrations and what are called seismic waves, scientists have come to the conclusion that the earth has essentially three sections. The crust, the mantle and the core.</p>
		<p>We live on the crust. With oceans and mountains and forests the crust is barely 40-60 km thick when the radius of the earth is 6500 km.</p>

		<p>The core has two parts. Deep inside the earth is a solid hard core of nickel and iron with a radius of about 1300 km. The temperature of the core is nearly 4000&#9900;C, but the pressure inside is so large that it remains solid. Surrounding this solid core is molten iron and nickel more than 2280 km thick which is again surrounded by molten rock 2900 km thick. This is called mantle. Huge plates of rock float on the mantle carrying the continents and the oceans which make the crust. Some time molten rocks at about 1000-1500&#9900;C, gush out through some weak spots on the crust and turn into volcanoes.</p>
		<p>The plates on which the continents rest are called continental plates which at some places keep moving, drifting very very slowly. You may be surprised to learn that once upon a time, India was a part of Africa. Then it drifted towards the north east and stopped when it pressed against China. The pressure was so enormous that huge mountains poured out and the Himalayas were formed. Amazing! Is it not?</p>
		<p>As for earthquakes, when the shells or plates that drift, come close to each other, they may hit suddenly and the force is so large that the surface shakes and cracks. The buildings and bridges collapse. Huge chasms are formed and thousands of people may die as a result. The shock waves spread, hitting neighbouring towns and cities. Some of you may just about remember the earthquake in Gujarat in the year 2001. Thousands of people died as a result.</p>

		<p>Like continental plates there are oceanic plates under the oceans. These are thinner than continental plates. When these plates break suddenly, one part of the plate may move up and the other down. An enormous body of water is suddenly displaced . A huge amount of potential energy is released and the displaced water carries the energy as waves rushing at about 700km/hour, i.e. nearly the speed of sound. The closer they come towards the shore the more the speed is reduced, the height of the waves increases and with tremendous energy they hit the shore and devastate whatever come in their way. This is called “Tsunami” in Japanese, meaning harbour waves. Tsunami takes place when oceanic plates move up or down or they are vertically displaced.</p>

		<p>The solid core of the earth is a magnet and accounts for the earth’s magnetism. We shall talk about this later.</p>
		<p>The present story is about what is inside the earth that causes volcanoes to spout fire and lava and the drifting and cracking of the plates on which our continents and oceans rest, leading to earthquakes and Tsunamis. When we talk about geothermal energy as a possible source of alternative energy, we shall refer to the mantle where stones and rocks melt and boil and how from the upper part of the mantle hot geysers gush out in tall columns and hot springs throw up water nice and hot.</p>
