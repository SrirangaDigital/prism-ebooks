		<p>The boats were made of Papyrus, a kind of dry reed. There were sails which caught the wind and the boats travelled along the Nile. There were also slaves who rowed when the wind dropped. That was more than 5000 years ago. The Egyptians were possibly among the first ancient civilizations to use sails and utilise wind power to travel along zivers and cross the seas. The Harappans of the Indus valley, at the mature stage of their civilizations around the same time also used small ships and sails.</p>
		<p>The sails and the masts were made more and more sophisticated and robust to help travel across the direction of wind flow if required. The size of the boats and the number of sails employed kept increasing.</p>

		<p>Mariners kept finding out the best routes where the wind blew towards their destination and avoided doldrums (<em>calm areas within +5&#9900; and -5&#9900; of the equator where the wind is often still</em>). The wind returning from the poles and shifted by the earth’s rotation, (the Coriolis effect), helped navigation and helped trades. The trade winds blow predominantly from North East in the northern hemisphere and South East in the southern hemisphere. The trade winds have been used by sailing ships to cross the oceans for centuries. As has been described earlier, armed with a magnetic compass the Europeans established trade routes across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, trading with some countries and often plundering and colonizing others. Sea worthy steamships began to replace sailing ships only after the latter part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. By then the British had established their empire in the West and the East, including in India, crossing the oceans in sailing ships.</p>
		<p>There were other uses of wind power. Windmills were used for threshing and grinding wheat for centuries. Even now they are used in a number of Greek islands for the same purpose.</p>
		<p>Wind can be very deceptive. Its speed may vary from a gentle breeze at 10km an hour to a giant killer at 300 to even 400km/hour.</p>
		<p>The kinetic energy associated with a moving body varies as the square of its speed. In other words, the power of a body of a <em>fixed mass</em>, moving at 100 km/hour is 100 times that of the same body moving at 10 km/hour.</p>
		<p><em>In the case of moving air the mass is not a constant. It varies directly as the velocity. The power of wind is, therefore, proportional to the cube of its velocity. The power of wind travelling at 200 km/hour is 4000 times that of wind at 10 km/hour.</em></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">CYCLONE</h2>
			<p>It was on the 8<sup>th</sup> of November 1970 that a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal started forming, slowly pushing North towards Bangladesh as it grew and partly moving towards the Sunderban area of West Bengal. A cyclone may be formed when the temperature of the sea is around 26 deg. Hot air rises and begins to swirl in the same direction as the earth’s motion, (anti-clockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere) The velocity of this November cyclone towards Bangladesh reached a speed of about 190km/hour and started pushing further towards the North East. Sea water churned by the cyclonic swirl became monstrous and surged ahead, destroying whatever came in the way. The storm abated after three days. By that time the devastation was complete. Many villages perished. Almost 500,000 people died.</p>
			<p>A more recent incidence of cyclone was in the month of May 2010 which struck Andhra Pradesh. The cyclone named Laila (<em>Arabic for Night</em>). On 17 May, it formed on the Bay of Bengal from a persistent area of convection when air becomes hot and moves up It gathered strength as it moved North West and its speed reached up to 120 km/hour. It made landfall near Bapatla in AP and after causing considerable damage, the cyclone dissipated itself on land.</p>
			<p>Cyclones are also common in the Atlantic Ocean. A tropical cyclone is usually referred to as hurricane in the Atlantic. The name <em>hurricane</em> seems to have been derived from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind called Huracan. One of the relatively recent incidents of hurricane was the <em>Hurricane Katrina</em> in the year 2005. It formed in the Bahamas and crossed to the Gulf of Mexico and the Southern United States. A cyclone or a hurricane lasts for 2-6 days. Hurricane Katrina resulted in about 2000 deaths as well as causing a significant destruction of property. Although cyclones and hurricanes cause terrible damage of life and property, they help in distributing heat across the troposphere.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">TORNADOES</h2>
			<p>A Tornado is a violent and dangerous rotation of a column of air that stretches from the surface of the earth to the cloud and shaped like a funnel, it rotates as cyclones do, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the South. They may cause devastation, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh. Typically a tornado travels at about 180km/hour. It is also commonly known as a Twister since it keeps twisting itself.</p>
			<p>Cyclones, hurricanes and tornadoes, may have devastating effects as history has repeatedly shown, and keeps showing from time to time. They have smashed and destroyed many ships but gentle winds have carried many more across the oceans. Short of taking proper precautions, we can do nothing to control winds. Better prediction of an impending cyclone or tornado has been very helpful in saving lives, especially of fishermen at sea.</p>
