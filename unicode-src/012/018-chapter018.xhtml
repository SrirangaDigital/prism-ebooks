		<p>Lightning has always terrified men and animals. Lightning flashes on buildings and churches have caused severe damages and deaths and they still do. What causes lightning? It was considered to be divine punishment for the evildoers. Supernatural explanations of natural phenomena are still a common practice.</p>
		<p>Interestingly, about 2600 years before now, Thales (624 BC- 546 BC) of Miletus in Ionia (present day Turkey) searched for physical reasons (<em>logos)</em> as different from mythological explanations (<em>mythos</em>) to explain physical phenomena and was one of the seven sages listed by Plato (429 BC-347 BC), the great Greek Philosopher. According to Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), the British Scientist and Philosopher, “Western Science started with Thales”. Thales (THAY-leez) was a great mathematician and took interest in various natural phenomena.</p>
		<p>There are references, not fully authenticated though, that Thales knew that Amber (called <em>elektron</em> in Greek) when rubbed with silk develops properties of attracting dry leaves and he also knew of <em>Lodestones</em> (magnetic stones) that have a natural property of attracting certain metals and swing in a certain direction when suspended by a string. Some believe that the stories of electricity and magnetism should begin with Thales.</p>
		<p>Not much was known about electricity for centuries until around the middle of the eighteenth century when machines for producing strong static charges began to be made. These were mainly used for amusements and commercial exploitation. An American however startled the world by drawing electricity from the clouds. It was only towards the end of the eighteenth century, that an Italian scientist showed how by chemical means electric charges could be made to flow and produced what is called <em>Current electricity.</em></p>
		<p>A serendipitous discovery showed the link between electricity and magnetism and then came the great invention that electricity may be produced by rotating a magnet inside a coil.</p>
		<p>And from then on, science has been moving in leaps and bounds. Billions of units of electricity are being produced every instant now, to drive industries, light up dark nights, cool and heat the air as required, helping to run computers and sending signals round the earth in milliseconds.</p>

		<p>In the next few sections we shall discuss the very exciting stories of these discoveries, the lives of the inventors and also get to know how billions of tons of fossil fuels are being burnt to produce electricity, the life blood of modern civilization. Most of the technologies for alternative energy are geared towards the production of electricity, the cleanest and the most versatile form of energy that exists. Let us revert to static charges.</p>
		<p>You must have all tried rubbing a comb with silk and holding it close to small pieces of paper and seen how the pieces cling to the comb. We shall discuss the details of the structure of an atom later but suffice it to say now that atoms are electrically neutral. If negatively charged electrons of an atom are removed, there would be an excess of positively charged protons in the nucleus and the atom would become positively charged. On rubbing, the comb loses some electrons and becomes positively charged. Holding the comb near pieces of paper, the electrons from the atoms of the paper close to the comb are attracted to the positively charged comb. The pieces of paper being very light are lifted towards the comb since positive charges attract negative charges.</p>
		<p>As mentioned earlier, interest in making machines for generating strong static charges began in the early eighteenth century.</p>
		<p>The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) who was fascinated by scientific experiments, would pull out an electrical machine from his desk and charge himself up, ‘so that the fierce crackling sparks flew forth; and his long wild locks bristled and stood on end.’</p>

		<p>In clubs, unsuspecting guests would be shocked by cutleries that would be charged; candles would be relit and alcohol set to flame using electric sparks. Apart from these practices some physicians claimed that electric charges could cure various physical and mental disorders.</p>
		<p>It was around this time that a man, (one of the seventeen children of a person of modest means), who had to stop going to school at the age of ten because his father could not pay his school fees, grew up working in his brother’s printing shop. His genius and perseverance made him one of the greatest polymaths, a scientist, inventor, administrator, diplomat and a humanist, all in one. He was Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) described as “the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.”</p>

		<p>He took his science seriously. He wanted to understand what causes lightning and thought of an ingenious experiment that could have, in a flash, terminated this extraordinary life. On a rainy day when lightning flashed across the sky, he sent a silk kite into the dark clouds. A key connected to the silk thread got charged confirming the idea that lightning is caused by the build up of electricity in clouds. (Charges are formed by friction of air and water droplets and ice particles. A lightning strike carries more than 10,000 ampere of currents at hundred million volts.)</p>
		<p>Franklin always believed in finding a use for his science. He had made a cheap heater called “Franklin Stove” cheap enough for the poor to afford. Franklin invented a device that would prevent lightning strikes. He had observed that tall buildings such as churches were particularly vulnerable to lightning strikes. He fixed rods with spikes mounted on top of tall buildings and churches and connected these through thick copper wires mounted outside the buildings and grounded them. Electric charges accumulating on the spike would attract the lightning current which would flow to the ground, sparing the buildings. Lightning rods as they are called, saved thousands of lives. They also helped to dispel the belief that God uses Lightning to punish the evildoers.</p>
