		<p>Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). One of the greatest inventors who had 1036 patents to his credit, invented the Incandescent lamps that are still in use, the kinetoscope (Cinematography), phonograph (Gramophone) and the technology of power distribution.</p>
		<p>He helped in several ways to usher in modern civilization. His formal education in Milan, Ohio, USA, ended in three months when he overheard one of his teachers refer to him as ‘addled’ (muddled, confused) because he did not pay attention in the classes. He was taught at home by his mother. He used to sell candies and newspapers in trains. Edison was appointed a telegraph operator in a railway station as a reward for saving the stationmaster’s little child from being run over by a train. This is where, as an operator Edison learnt about electricity, about batteries, about magnets and above all the art of telegraphy. While working as a night operator he made several inventions for improving telegraphy. He could not, however, retain his job at the station too long. During his experiments he spilled acid which flowed through the wooden floor to the stationmaster’s table downstairs.</p>
		<p>Edison patented some of his inventions and made a lot of money selling them.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Edison set up his industries and business. He is known to have said that “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration.” His tenacity was unbelievable. He used to say: “If I find 10,000 ways of something that won’t work, I haven’t failed. I am not discouraged because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.”</p>
		<p>Let us go into the story of incandescent lamps which brought great fame and money to Edison. After the invention of Volta’s pile, scientists from various parts of the world tried to produce light using electricity. It was Professor Joseph Swan who came very close to making the incandescent lamp that we know today. He had realized that the filament to be used for making a lamp had to be inserted inside a glass bulb which should be evacuated. The evacuation of the bulbs is necessary to remove oxygen to prevent burning out of the hot filament.</p>
		<p>Edison possibly took the Swan lamp and started trying out all kinds of materials like carbon made out of different types of fibres to make the filament.</p>
		<p>It needs to be remembered that the power P emitted by a bulb is given by P=VI and V=RI and hence P=I<sup>2</sup>R=V<sup>2</sup>/R, where I is current,V is the voltage applied and R the resistance of the filament. Obviously, for the same voltage, low resistance gives larger power and high resistance gives low power.</p>
		<p>Resistance is high if the filament is long and thin. It is low if the filament is short and thick. Low voltage draws less current for the same resistance. Edison found that the best option would be to keep voltage low (110 volts) and use short and thick filaments to get a reasonable amount of Power. <em>Thick and short filaments would be less fragile</em> and low voltage needs less robust insulation for cables. Perhaps this is how 110 volts became the standard voltage in the US and Canada.</p>
		<p>Edison and his team kept trying endlessly. Then one day the lamp could be lighted and it continued to burn. Edison and his team looked on and the experience is best described in Edison’s own words.</p>
		<p>“The day was –let me see—October 21, 1879. We sat and looked, and the lamp continued to burn, and the longer it burnt, the more fascinated we were. None of us could go to bed. There was no sleep for us for forty hours. We sat and just watched it with anxiety going into elation. It lasted about forty hours”.</p>

		<p>Edison knew that something spectacular needed to be made to catch public attention. So he got thousands of lamps made. Made generators large enough to feed thousands of lamps and decorated the road leading to his house at Menlo Park. Hordes of people poured in to see the “magic” to be shown by the “Wizard of Menlo Park” and as darkness fell, thousands of lights were switched on, making the night as bright as the day.</p>
		<p>Initially, the Ediswan company was floated and when Edison was granted a patent in the year 1880, he continued to make thousands of electric bulbs.</p>

		<p>Trillions of bulbs must have been made and have burnt out over the one hundred and thirty years incandescent bulbs have been in operation.</p>
		<p>Incandescent lamps are inefficient since they produce more heat than light. With filaments made of Tungsten the present incandescent lamps last reasonably long. These are, however, being slowly replaced. We shall discuss this in another chapter. Saving energy is an alternative source of energy.</p>
		<p>Edison’s phonograph revolutionized the world in a different way. No body could imagine that a sound could be stored. Edison did exactly that by making a needle vibrate in response to a sound, etch the vibration on wax and run the needle back along the track and reproduce the sound. Cylinders made of paste boards with wax deposited on them were used for etching the vibrations and horns used for amplifying the sound from the vibrations. Sound recording and reproduction have moved miles away from the day when Edison had recorded, “Mary had a little lamb…” on his phonograph.</p>
		<p>Kinetography was also Edison’s invention. You may know that if you take one second to lift a cup to your lip, and say 12 shots are taken of this action and projected back, the viewer will not see jerky motion but a continuous movement of the hand because of persistence of vision. Based on this principle, Cinematography was introduced by Edison. This technology has moved thousands of miles.</p>
		<p>And so has the Edison General Electric Company, set up by Edison which is now the famous General Electric Company.</p>
