		<img src="images/104.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>Let us leave the Niagara behind for now and come home to India to Karnataka.</p>
		<p>Rising out of Talakaveri, Kaveri flows down the Deccan plateau towards South east on her way to Tamilnadu, finally to merge with the Bay of Bengal.</p>
		<p>After her emergence from Talakaveri, she flows quietly past Srirangapatna.</p>
		<p>Soon the tributary Shimsha river joins her and Kaveri changes from a slender rivulet into a mighty river and at Shivasamudram, Gaganachukki and Bharachukki falls drop 320 feet in gorgeous splendour. So has it been for centuries.</p>
		<p>A little over hundred years before now some engineers had other ideas than just to watch the beauty of Kaveri.</p>
		<p>The Kolar gold mine was to be exploited to the fullest extent and a township was growing there. The use of Kolar gold goes back to antiquity. It has been traced to Mahenjodoro and Harappa. Deep mines had to be dug and a township needed electricity, and so came up the first Hydel plant in Shivasamudram, delivering 42 MW of AC at 25 Hz to Kolar, the first of its kind in Asia. The transmission line of 147km was the longest in the world at 78kV,the highest voltage in those days.</p>
		<p>The Kolar township got electrified, so did Mysore and Bangalore with alternating current.</p>
		<p>Hydroelectricity is a perfect renewable energy source. Water vapour from the seas and rivers rise up, form clouds and come down in rains filling lakes, rivers and canals. As the rivers flow, one can place dams and collect water in huge reservoirs. The water is let out and due to free fall acquires kinetic energy which is converted into electricity. Some time water is taken far down through penstocks and made to drive turbines. If you go to Shimshapura half way down to Mysore from Bangalore, you can visit yet another historic hydel station. When power from Shivasamudram could not meet the growing needs, another hydel station was set up from Shimsha river generating 17.2 MW in 1938. Hydel stations serve two purposes. They produce electricity and at the same time help to irrigate lands with the discharge water flowing down canals.</p>
		<p>Not far from Mysore is the Krishnarajasagar dam. This is on the Kaveri river. Apart from irrigating land these reservoirs help to provide drinking water.</p>
		<p>It is solar energy which causes evaporation. Condensation takes place in the troposphere and gravitational pull causes rains. The cycle goes on and on <em>cleaning the air rather than polluting it</em>.</p>

		<p>The major problems associated with the setting up of hydroelectric stations are deforestation and displacement of population. Strict legislation has considerably controlled both.</p>
		<p>In the context of using hydropower and creating canal irrigation in Karnataka state we remember with deep reverence and gratitude the most outstanding engineer and a great human being who was born about 70 km from Bangalore in a village called Muddenahally. He was Sir M. Visvesvaraya (1860-1961).</p>
		<p>Visit Muddenahally or Shivasamudram or Krishnaraja Sagar and you will come back with awe that a man could achieve what the great Visvesvaraya had achieved, in engineering, in administration and in propagating education.</p>
		<p>He lost his father when he was barely 15 and had his education in different places, finally graduating in engineering and joining the Public Works Department. His brilliance, enterprise and integrity did not go unnoticed.</p>
		<p>The man who was known to carry two candles, one for his office work and the other which he used to buy with his own money, to carry out his personal work, the man who on the day of his retirement, refused the office car and walked home. He was not trying to impress any one. He wanted to tell the world that it is not enough to be honest but to set extreme examples of how far true honesty should take us and that there is no room for compromise as far as integrity is concerned.</p>
		<p>His meticulousness showed in his execution of huge projects. When Krishnaraja Sagar was built, it was possibly one of the largest dams in the world at that time. While planning the Brindavan Gardens, he did not forget the dancing fountains which still cheer millions of visitors.</p>
		<p>Visvesvaraya, the boy from Muddenahally, was made the Diwan of Mysore in 1912 and served for seven years in this capacity. After retirement he helped the next Diwan Mirza Ismail as a mentor. Visvesvaraya was knighted by the British in 1915 and fondly referred to as Sir MV ever since.</p>
		<p>On one hand Sir MV kept setting up industries, on the other irrigating land to help agriculture. He realized that engineering education was absolutely essential to provide necessary manpower for sustaining both. In 1917, as the Diwan, he set up an Engineering College which is the present University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering. (UVCE).</p>
		<p>He was conferred the title of Bharat Ratna by the Government of India in 1955.</p>

		<p>There are now 34 dams and 24 hydroelectric stations in Karnataka state. There was a time when all the electricity in Karnataka came from Hydroelectric power. Inspired by the example of Sir MV, it was Indian engineers who designed and executed these dams and Power stations.</p>
		<p>Make a trip to Varahi, not very far from Shimoga. The Hydel station there is housed inside a hill. Many years back, when we went there, our car entered a tunnel dug into a hill. After a fairly long drive inside, we stopped and suddenly entered an enormous cave which seemed like Ali Baba’s mysterious cave. It was not strewn with jewels and gold but had modern machines, instruments and gadgets for remote control. There are four generators there, producing 460MW of Power, fed from the river Varahi collected in a huge reservoir atop the hill. Every thing I saw there was “Made in India”.</p>
		<p>It was Sir M. Visvesvaraya who gave Indian engineers the password, “Open Sesame”.</p>
