		<p>We were sitting in our classroom in Barisal Zilla School. Barisal is a town on the bank of the river Kirtonkhola, now in Bangladesh. It was very hot but there was no fan. In every classroom huge pankhas were fitted from the ceiling. These pankhas were pulled by a rope. A boy of our age called the “pankhapuller’ used to pull the pankhas so that we could study in relative comfort. When my mind goes back to those days I feel upset about the barbarism that was in practice and which unfortunately persists even today since we still exploit child labour. We have seen, going back to the days of Industrial revolution, how Technology has been freeing us from drudgery. Tesla’s invention of induction motors has made fans rugged and cheap and replaced pankhas and painful manual labour.</p>
		<p>In Barisal we used to have electricity for four hours in the evening from 6 to 10 p.m. only for electric lights and we had to have kerosene lanterns afterwards.</p>
		<p>Electricity spread widely since 1950. Karnataka depended only on hydroelectric power until monsoon failures forced Karnataka to resort to Coal based Thermal power plants in Raichur. There are gas based power plants and Nuclear power plants (Kaiga) to meet the steeply increasing power demand of the state.</p>
		<p>The total capacity for generating electric power in India has come up to 250,000 MW about 100 times of what we had earlier. And yet this capacity falls far short of our requirement. We need electricity for almost everything, for lighting, for cooling, for running motors for Industries, for driving pumps for irrigating lands, for communication, for running computers and for radio and televisions. Electricity is indispensable for our daily existence. It is like the breath of our life and yet 400 millions out of 1200 million Indians have no access to electricity or 75 million rural homes out of 155 millions have no electric connection at all not even for lighting in the evening and children have to study in candle lights or kerosene lamps much like our predecessors used animal fat for lighting the caves they lived in.</p>
		<p>Refrigerators have become absolute necessities these days. They not only prevent wastage of food but have freed women from the kitchen to some extent. But many cannot afford refrigerators.</p>
		<p>Pankhas have been replaced by fans and air conditioners.</p>
		<p>Irrigation pumpsets are essential for growing food. Failed monsoons frequently caused droughts and famines when artificial irrigation was not widely available. In 1942, 2-3 million people died as a result of the Bengal famine (the British were also largely responsible for the famine). There are over 18 million pumpsets in India now as against 18000 in 1950 and these have significantly helped the <em>Green Revolution</em> that has increased our food production to a very large extent. Agricultural consumption of electricity comes to about 21% of the total electricity generated.</p>

		<p>India’s Industrial growth has been significant and has substantially contributed to India’s growth. Industries use 35% of electrical energy in India.</p>
		<p>Apart from electricity, there are other forms of energy, mostly oil, which is primarily needed for transport. The availability of gas cylinders has made life easier for many women in our country. But they constitute a relatively small section of the total population. Chulahs are generally used for cooking in villages and also in cities using fuel wood or dung cakes that are available for free. Fumes from these chulahs are very harmful to health. Women who have to spend long hours at home and in the kitchen are the main victims. In India,fumes from chulahs are believed to cause 3 to 4 lakhs of deaths every year. Use of cooking gas could solve this problem but is unaffordable to most.</p>
		<p>As we keep adding up the energy requirements for what are deemed to be essentials in life, which have made our lives more liveable, the figures are staggering. The burgeoning population which has become 1200 million from about 300 million in 1947 and the substantive increase of the essentials of life has made Energy problem one of the most acute and complicated problems for our energy poor nation.</p>
		<p><em>Energy is the driver of development and plays a major role in fighting poverty. At the same time energy production and energy use cause atmospheric pollution</em>.</p>
		<p>Out of the 250,000 MW of electric power 67% is from Thermal sources, 21% is from Hydel sources and the remaining 18% comes from various other sources out of which 2-3% is from Wind Power and about the same from Nuclear power. Thermal power is mainly obtained from burning coal and Lignite (57%) and that is the main source of atmospheric pollution which desperately needs to be reduced.</p>

		<p>It has been estimated that we need to add about 200,000MW of power generating capacity in the next 10 years to meet our basic requirements of electricity, providing electricity for the villagers, sustain Agricultural and Industrial growth. We shall still be far short of China in our consumption of electrical energy. In India the annual average of electricity consumption per capita is around 700 kWh (or units) which is about a quarter of the consumption in China, 1/10 th of the consumption in Western Europe. In US and Canada per capita consumption is around 14000 units.</p>

		<p>If we have to add 200,000MW of electricity, much of it has to come from burning coal. If the production of cars continues unabated, oil import will continue to increase. Electricity and Transport, Coal for electricity and oil for cars, will continue to pollute our atmosphere. What are the alternatives open to us? We have to look into these and do our best.</p>
