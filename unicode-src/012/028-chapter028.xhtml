		<p>Our car got held up in a queue. Not at traffic lights but inside a shopping mall. There were a number of cars ahead of us, all burning petrol and the parking space was getting filled with fumes. There were huge exhaust fans running full speed and yet there was a strong foul smell of polluted air. After parking the car, we stood in a queue again for a lift to the sixth floor. Of course the mall was fully air-conditioned and that was a relief. Sunlight hardly reached there but the mall dazzled in artificial light.</p>
		<p>Suddenly every thing seemed very odd to me. There we were, burning petrol and using an enormous amount of electricity just for a handful of people to shop in comfort at an expensive place when we learnt earlier that 400 million Indians have no access to electricity and the children have to read in candle light or with kerosene lamps even today! We also learnt that each person in the US and Canada uses nearly 20 times electricity compared to us in India. But within our country one third of our own people cannot use even a single unit of electricity!</p>
		<p>If the situation has to be rectified to some extent, we have to add at least 200,000 MW of power generation to the already existing 250,000 MW over the next 10 years. How can we do it? And what would be the consequences? Nearly 57% of the electricity we produce comes from burning coal. More than 50% of the electricity that we intend to produce during the next ten years, we are told, also has to be coal-based.</p>

		<p>But isnâ€™t there a great problem of pollution caused by burning coal? There is and we seem to be stuck on the horns of a dilemma.</p>
		<p>Let us see what the Coal situation is in India.</p>
		<p>India is placed fourth in the world so far as coal reserves is concerned and third as far as its production. Our reserve exceeds 197 billion tons in shallow mines which are mostly distributed in Orissa, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand, Singarani in Andhra Pradesh, Jharia in Dhanbad and in Raniganj, West Bengal and also in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
		<p>The calorific value of our coal which means the amount of energy ( heat in calories) that a fixed mass of coal (kg) can produce on burning, is relatively low. Our coal has 15-45 % of ash content but relatively less Sulphur and Nitrogen compounds which are very harmful as we shall presently see. The pollution caused by burning coal is mainly in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere and the ash that is left on the ground.</p>

		<p>The very act of coal mining causes pollution. Rainwater seeps in through the portions broken open and pollutes ground water. Coal mining is a hazardous and a risky occupation for miners. Improved technology has reduced catastrophic incidences where helpless men got trapped inside and perished.</p>
		<p>Coal ash or fly ash as it is called, produces substantial problems. In some places these are left in heaps in the open. Fly ash some time get mixed with ground water or river water. Fly ash often contains heavy metals (mercury) inherent in the coal and these get deposited in ground water and drinking water is severely polluted. Efforts are on to utilize fly ash by making bricks or using them for agriculture.</p>
		<p>As has been mentioned earlier, Indian coal is relatively free from Sulphur which forms oxides and once in contact with water in the atmosphere, turn into acids. Heard of <em>acid rain</em>? Apart from the damage to health, acid rains damage habitations and forests. The great monument of <em>Taj Mahal</em>, made of the finest marble has not been completely spared. Marble as you know, reacts with acids, that may rain down, if there are oxides of sulphur or Nitrogen in the exhausts from burning coal emitted into the atmosphere.</p>
		<p>Carbon dioxide is the biggest pollutant. The situation is not much better in the U.S. or in China. In US out of 300 GW (i.e. 300,000MW), the effluents from most of coal based generators are not treated according to proposed practices to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Both China and US are engaged in setting up large thermal power stations. It may not be generally known that waste from coal may also carry nuclear waste.</p>

		<p>Considerable International pressure is building up on India and China to contain CO<sub>2</sub> emission. India has very little choice, other than use existing methods and also develop technology to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission to a substantive degree. Globally, electricity generation is the largest contributor to climate change, producing more than 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. The environmental damage caused by Worldwide electricity generation is estimated at 2.6 trillion US dollars(130 trillion Indian rupees).</p>
		<p>So far as India is concerned we do not have much choice. We cannot stop electricity generation or prevent further growth if we have to make progress and ensure that most of us have access to electricity.</p>
		<p>Since our gas and oil reserves are minimal, coal is the only fossil fuel that we may rely on. Hydroelectric power needs to be exploited to the extent possible with minimum ecological damage by deforestation.</p>
		<p>As we turn to alternatives, let us minimize losses in generation of electricity, drastically reduce losses in Transmission/Distribution and utilization, contain extravagant use of electricity by imposing penalty and adopt all measures to improve efficiency of all coal based generators planned for the future.</p>
