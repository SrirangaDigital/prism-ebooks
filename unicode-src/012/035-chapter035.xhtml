			<figcaption>Our universe is thought to have begun 13.7 billion years ago as an infinitesimally small, infinitely hot andinfinitely dense something and it began to expand very fast. Matter evolved, galaxies were formed and our galaxy the Milky way was formed, and one star out of billions of stars in our galaxy is the Sun from which the earth came out and that is where we evolved the humans and that is in brief the story of our Universe of which we know of a minute fraction</figcaption>

		<p>It seems like a miracle, does it not, that our earth which is like a speck of dust in this endless Universe, every thing is right, every thing is in its place so that life could spring forth and I should be telling you a story and some of you may have been listening to me.</p>
		<p>It is the story of energy. Energy which is bestowed on us by the sun, gives and sustains life. Like other planets, the earth spilled out of the sun and started orbiting it. That was 4.5 billion years ago. Then a “rogue planet” grazed past the earth and the mass of the moon spilled out and started rotating round the earth. The earth got tilted and so we have different seasons in the year.</p>
		<p>The inside of the earth is filled with molten lava and further inside, with iron,nickel and other metals and the core is a solid mass which is a magnet. The core produces magnetic fields that deflect some rays that would have been lethal for life to grow. The earth is covered by an atmosphere which is like a concrete roof over the earth and many meteors and meteorites heading for the earth get burnt, sparing the earth from being destroyed. Celestial bodies brought a mysterious liquid for us which has all the right properties for producing and sustaining life. It is water. The crevices and gorges on the earth were filled with water and the oceans were formed. Water froze into glaciers and icebergs near the poles which float since water has a strange property where its solid form is lighter than its liquid form. The floating ice cover was a wonderful lid that prevented the oceans from getting too cold and freeze into a solid mass and so marine life could thrive underneath. Plants grew inside the oceans, grass and trees grew on the surface of the earth. Green leaves having a strange chemical called Chlorophyll which help photosynthesis that absorb light from the sun and turn Carbon dioxide and sap into food that make trees grow.</p>
		<p>When trees died and fell down they went inside the earth and after millions of years turned into coal, one of our fossil fuels that we keep burning and fill our planet with noxious fumes. Decayed marine life filled crevices below the oceans with oil which we have been burning in trillions of litres.</p>
		<p>We, humans, came to this planet relatively recently. We suddenly invented how to produce fire. We began to burn dry wood and cook. We invented how to produce light by burning fat with algae as wick. Caves where we lived in total darkness lighted up. We learnt to make tools which helped us to hunt and also make boats. We began to travel. Wind that solar heat helps to produce and the earth’s rotation helps to blow helped us to sail.</p>
		<p>During this period, our energy needs were very limited. We used sun’s light and heat and burnt wood for making fire. We used animals to carry us and wind for sailing across the oceans. We discovered metal, coal and oil, made instruments and weapons and we needed more and more of them for fighting each other.</p>
		<p>Then came the Industrial revolution as we began to make steam to work for us.</p>
		<p>We needed more coal and more steel. Then we invented rail engines to take us from one place to another. Then we invented the internal combustion engine and made automobiles. We learnt to fly. We used more and more oil. We have been burning fossil fuels and polluting the atmosphere. In less than two hundred years our energy use has gone sky high and we have begun to fight for oil. We are using enormous amount of energy in our war preparations and draining the earth’s meagre reserve.</p>
		<p><em>Then came the second Industrial revolution, our discovering electricity, producing it and making it work for us.</em></p>
		<p>We need to burn enormous amount of coal for producing electricity. We use it for lighting up and turning nights into days. We use electricity to run huge motors and small motors which do all sorts of work for us, keeping us cool in summer and warming us when it turns cold. Life, for some has become more comfortable. Travelling has become faster, communication can be made in nano seconds.</p>
		<p>Nuclear power was thought to be an infinite source of energy at our disposal. The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the lingering radiations followed later by the failure of a few nuclear reactors brought home the lethal nature of nuclear power. The recent Fukushima disaster in the nuclear reactors in Japan has alerted the world and several countries are going to wind up nuclear energy production. Germany is leading the way.</p>
		<p>We have realized, rather belatedly, that we are draining mother earth of all her energy reserves and we shall have nothing left after a hundred years. Nuclear energy may not be the infinite source of energy that we thought earlier and we have serious reservations about it now. We must again turn back to Solar energy and Wind energy but use them with much greater skill and efficiency compared to what we used to do thousands of years back. Alternative energy forms using wind, solar and hydro energy, geothermal and ocean energy which are all renewable and the cleanest of all need to be our choice. Most importantly these energy sources do not make the planet unlivable. How are we placed in India? Not very comfortably and we have to do every thing that we can to save energy and use it equitably.</p>
		<p><em>Nature gives us solar energy in abundance and that needs to be our primary choice</em>.</p>
		<p>Most important of all, Peace must prevail and the utterly devastating use of energy for war or for its preparation must come to an end if humanity has to survive.</p>
		<p>I tried to tell you these stories so that you know how lucky we have been to be born and nurtured into this wonderful earth and how we have the responsibility of saving this beautiful planet.</p>
		<p>I remember a song ( not one of Tagore’s) that I had heard when I was a child and have not heard ever since. I translate it for you:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>“O, mother earth! All I can leave behind for you</em><br /> <em>Are two drops of tears.</em><br /> <em>I plundered you and squandered what I plundered</em><br /> <em>And when it came to giving something back,</em><br /> <em>All I found were tears of repentance.</em></p>
