		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">OUR EARTH AND OUR QUEST FOR ENERGY</h1>
<img src="images/004.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The whole world is passing through an Energy crisis. Some countries more than others.</p>
<p>India has an acute shortage of energy and it is likely to get worse if we do not do something soon.</p>
<p>Almost all the energy that we use now came from the sun. It has been flowing in over billions of years ever since the earth spilled out of the sun and started orbiting round it.</p>
<p>Some of that energy has been stored inside the earth as what are called fossil fuels. Coal, oil and gas are the main fossil fuels that were stored under the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Life has grown in this planet of ours by sheer accidental combination of events that were favourable for the growth of life. We are very fortunate that every thing was right. We have the right temperature, right atmosphere, plenty of water, right magnetic field to ward off harmful radiations that destroy life. It is near miracle that humans evolved, humans who have large enough brains to think, to learn, to create, to love but sadly to hate also. We have tried to make our lives comfortable through various inventions but in the process squandered what the earth had stored for us.</p>
<p>Some sources of energy cannot be renewed once we have used them up and the store has been getting emptier. These are non-renewable energy like coal and oil that took millions of years to be processed and stored. There are others which are constantly renewed like solar energy and all other forms of energy like wind and rain that solar energy gives rise to. It would be good to know how different sources of energy were formed and how we learnt to make use of them. Stories of these discoveries are always exciting. It will also be interesting to learn about the inside of the earth and the atmosphere that shields us, and protected in this comfortable planet of ours, how restless human minds invented the ways to live in greater comfort, to light up the dark nights and travel faster and faster.</p>
<p>All these endeavours use up energy and we have waken, rather late, not only to control our energy use from fossils but also use “Alternative forms of energy” that are constantly renewed and will not run out like fossil fuels.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">WHAT IS ENERGY?</h1>
<img src="images/005.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Before we get started we need to know, “What exactly is energy” as defined in Physics.</p>
<p>Open any text book and you will find energy being defined as, “the capacity to do work.” It is right but it does not tell the whole story. What we are going to recount in this chapter may seem somewhat elementary to some of you. But a quick revision of the basic concepts may be useful.</p>
<p>Let us first understand the exact differences between what are called</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Force</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Energy, through a poem.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center"><em>You should know of course,</em><br /> <em>What is FORCE,</em><br /> <em>It is mass times acceleration;</em><br /> <em>While force times speed </em><br /> <em>Is POWER indeed,</em><br /> <em>You need more of it</em><br /> <em>The faster you run.</em><br /> <em>If you take for instance,</em><br /> <em>Force times distance</em><br /> <em>It is ENERGY or WORK DONE………</em></p>
<p>Distance is often measured in metres and time in seconds. Velocity is metres per second and acceleration is rate of change of velocity or change of velocity per second. We can write:</p>
<p>Force = mass &#215; acceleration  Power = Force &#215; velocity</p>
<p>Energy = Work done = Force &#215; distance</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/006.jpg" alt="image"/>
<figcaption><strong>Potential and Kinetic energy</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let us not forget that all these were defined by Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>
<p>Energy does not have to take the form of motion only. It takes the form of motion, heat, light, sound, electricity and also has chemical form. Energy often transforms from one form to another. Burn a candle, the chemical energy stored in the wax of the candle, turns into light energy and heat energy. If you burn a candle and the candle lasts for say one hour, the same candle cut into two equal halves will give twice as much light or power but will last only half an hour. Cut into four identical pieces, the candle will give four times as much light or power but will last only a quarter of an hour.</p>
<table>
<tr>
    <td>1 power &#215; 1 hour</td>
    <td>= 2 power &#215; 1/2 hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= 4 power &#215; 1/4 hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= Energy stored in the candle.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So, “<em>Energy is power multiplied by hour</em>” (by hour we mean time)</p>
<p>You can check for yourself a case of energy transformation. Rub your hands. The process of rubbing is mechanical work. You will soon feel that your palms feel warm. The energy stored in your muscles is chemical energy which helps you to do mechanical work which is converted into heat energy. Hit a drum. Chemical energy changes to Mechanical energy which changes into Sound energy. You can think of many such instances of energy changes or transformations.</p>
<p>If a big book kept on your table falls on your foot, it hurts. Does the book have any energy? It does not. When you lift it from the floor and place it on the table, you spend energy or do some work to lift the book. That energy is stored in the book as <em>Potential energy.</em></p>
<figure>
<img src="images/007.jpg" alt="image"/>
</figure>
<p>If a stone from an old monument, say the Qutb Minar in Delhi (1199 AD) falls on the tin roof of a shed below, it will make a big noise and also make a dent on the tin. Where does the energy come from? You will be surprised to learn that the energy spent by the masons who climbed up more than 800 years ago to place the stone on top of the Monument is still stored as <em>Potential energy</em> and manifests itself as <em>Kinetic energy</em> as it keeps falling on gravitational pull. As the stone hits the tin, it stops and gives up its Kinetic energy as sound and as mechanical energy in making a dent on the tin. After 800 years? You will be more surprised to learn that the energy from the candle that you light now came to our planet millions of years ago as light from the Sun and was stored in the oil that we extract from under the ground. Wax comes from this oil. This sounds crazy but it is true.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">THE SUN, EARTH’S MAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY</h1>
<img src="images/008.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>It is only a star, our sun. One of many billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky-Way which is one of many billions of galaxies in this universe, created, as is postulated, after a <em>big bang</em> about 13.7 billion years ago.<em> </em>Ever since then the universe is expanding, the galaxies are moving away from each other. That is another exciting story.</p>
<p>Let us now focus our attention on our sun, the provider of heat and light for the small planet that we inhabit and also the gravitational pull that keeps the earth orbiting round the sun along an almost elliptical path.</p>
<p>The sun is a fiery mass of gas made mostly of hydrogen (94%) and helium (6%). Its diameter is 1,391,980 km, 109 times larger than the earth. The temperature of the surface of the sun is about 5200&#9900;C. Rays of heat and light radiate continuously from there. Where does the sun get so much energy? We shall come to that story when we discuss nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Let us remember that heat, light, ultra violet and various cosmic rays belong to the same family of electromagnetic waves that James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79), the great Scottish physicist had mathematically shown to exist all over the universe and they all have the same incredibly large speed of 300,000 km per second. Out of the entire spectrum of Electromagnetic waves, visible light is a tiny section, extending as you know from red to violet. The distance between the peaks of two successive crests or troughs (or one cycle of a wave) is the wavelength and frequency is a measure of how many times the wave oscillates in a second. In the visible spectrum, red has the longest wave length (700 nm) and violet has the shortest length (400 nm), nm is nanometre which is one billionth of a metre.</p> 
<img src="images/009.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>(Sound waves do not come in this category. Sound waves are much slower,340 metres per second and need a medium to carry them. Light waves can pass through vacuum.)</p>
<p>Heat is the Infra red section that we can feel but cannot see. Its wavelength is larger than that of red and its frequency is lesser. Out of the total electromagnetic radiation that reaches the earth approximately 45% reaches us as infrared or heat, 53% as visible light and about 2% as other rays. Ultra violet rays that are harmful for us are largely trapped by a layer of ozone that surrounds the earth and we shall study how earth’s magnetism helps to deflect other harmful cosmic rays. In sum, the earth receives light and heat enough for life to grow and thrive.</p>
<img src="images/010.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p class="myquote"><strong>James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) -</strong> A great Scottish Mathematician, Maxwell is classed with Galileo, Newton and Einstein as one of the four greatest physicists of the world.</p>
<p class="myquote">Born to an aristocratic family of Scotland, he initially studied at home and when he joined school, he was somewhat lonely. His mathematical talents were soon recognized, especially after he won the school medal when he was barely 13 years old. His main education was in the University of Edinburgh under the tutelage of scientists like Sir William Hamilton and Professor Thompson.</p>
<p class="myquote">He had made major contributions to subjects like Heat and Thermodynamics but the most profound contribution that Maxwell made to Physics was his publication of “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.” He showed mathematically from some experimental results already published, that oscillations of electric and magnetic fields produce Electromagnetic waves that travel at a speed of 310,740 km/sec, much too close to the speed of light known at that time and he derived, with the help of his equations that light was also a section of electromagnetic waves and so are radio waves, as was experimentally proven by Heinrich Hertz and Jagadish Chandra Bose. This discovery has been termed as the second great unification in Physics after Newton’s Laws. Maxwell’s discoveries helped to usher in the era of modern physics laying the foundation for such fields as the Special Theory of Relativity and Quantum mechanics. According to Richard Feynman, Maxwell’s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics was the most important event of the 19 th century.</p>
<p class="myquote">Maxwell served as a Professor in the University of Aberdeen and King’s College, London during early years of his life and became the first Cavendish Professor at Cambridge. He had very high regard for Michael Faraday whose experimental results helped his derivation of Electromagnetic Theory. Faraday, forty years his senior, had high regard for Maxwell also. Maxwell died young, like his mother, at the age of 48 from abdominal cancer in the year 1879.</p>
<p>Is it not amazing that in this vast Universe of countless galaxies and stars, there exists this tiny planet of ours receiving the right amount of energy from a star that helped the growth of bacteria,vegetation and other living beings including all of us?</p>
<p>And we are made of tiny molecules, tinier atoms and we live and think and we are conscious! Next time you go to a beach and see the vast spread of sand, take a handful. You may have picked up billions of grains of sand. Let all the sand run through your fingers and take a look at just one grain. If that single grain is our earth then all the sand around you may be imagined to represent this universe. I know it is a crude analogy but just a way to comprehend our insignificance in the cosmic vastness.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">A CELESTIAL ACCIDENT</h1>
<img src="images/011.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>It was about 4.54 billion years ago when our sun had thrown out some of its extra ‘junk’, some heavy metals, parts of which became asteroids and got lost in space, and some coalesced and became planets. Our earth was one such planet, spinning rather slowly round an axis vertical to the plane of its orbital path, when a ‘rogue’ celestial body, almost as large as the Mars, is believed to have crashed in or grazed past it. A part of the mass of the earth was shorn off to become the moon. The axis of rotation of the earth got tilted by 23.5 degrees and the earth began to spin faster, taking a little over 24 hours to make one rotation. A simple celestial accident but what a difference has it made to us, the earthlings!</p>
<img src="images/012.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Seasonal variations happen because of the earth’s tilt. In the northern hemisphere the days become longer than nights from June till August. The sun is directly overhead on the tropic of Cancer, passing almost over Kolkata. The heat received is more direct and intense. Besides, the high solar flux received during longer days cannot be dissipated during shorter nights. We have summer. During the same period the nights are longer in the southern hemisphere. The solar flux received during the day is inclined and less intense, having to travel through more of the atmosphere for a shorter duration and dissipated during longer nights. In the southern hemisphere it is winter.</p>
<img src="images/013.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Just the opposite happens to the northern hemisphere during December to February and we have winter while the southerners have summer. September through November, days and nights are almost equal in both hemispheres. So are March, April and May, the lovely months of spring when trees burst into blossoms. But think of the Eskimos. For six months during summer in the Northern Hemisphere the sun does not set and for six months during our winter the sun does not rise. The Arctic and the Antarctic are permanently ice bound.</p>
<p>Had the earth not got tilted we would have eternal spring. Would it not be boring? Would that be an energy saver since we would not have to spend energy cooling ourselves during summer months and warming ourselves during winter months, as we do now? A difficult question since we don’t know whether we would be there at all or be like as we are now.</p>
<p>If there was no crash perhaps we would not have the moon to softly light up our nights reflecting sunlight. The gravitational pull between the earth and the moon which we shall talk about later, would not be there to give rise to the ocean tides.</p>
<p>Be it summer, winter or spring, heat from the sun keeps our planet warm when the temperature in the outer space is about -50&#9900;C. As we go higher up from the sea level, it gets cooler. You must have seen the pictures of the peaks on the Himalayas. They are always covered by snow. Those of you who have been on an aeroplane would have heard announcements on how cold it is outside.</p>
<p>Why should life exist on the earth and not on other planets in the solar system? It is an interesting question to ask but difficult to answer. In this universe, with billions of stars and planets separated by millions of light years (one light year is 9,4500000,000000 km), there may be life elsewhere but we know almost for certain that life as we know, does not exist in other planets of our solar system, not even in the Mars, the closest possible candidate for harbouring life. The earth is not too far away from the sun to be a frozen mass and not too close to be boiling hot. Our temperatures are just right for biochemical reactions to occur, leading to life. Water and oxygen are essential ingredients for life. We have both in abundance. At higher temperatures seas and oceans would evaporate and at lower temperatures they would freeze.</p>
<p>We seem to have the right combinations of every thing in this planet and that is why we are here.</p>
<p>Isn’t that fantastic!</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">A LOOK INSIDE THE EARTH</h1>
<img src="images/014.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Let us get to know something about the inside of our earth. It would help to learn about volcanoes which throw up some of the inner contents of the earth.</p>
<p>Pompeii. A prosperous town in Naples, south of Italy. It was possibly an autumn morning in 79 A.D., when a tremor shook the people up from slumber. The sky had turned grey. A column of smoke was rising like a huge tree with branches from the mount Vesuvius. This was followed by a stream of molten lava. The volcanic eruption continued for almost two days. Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town close by, were buried under volcanic ash and mud and lost for centuries, until they were discovered in 1748.</p>
<img src="images/015.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The last eruption of the mount Vesuvius occurred in the year 1944. There are many such volcanoes spread all over the world. Some are dead and some are still active. Fujiama in Japan is a beautiful volcano which is probably dead. What are volcanoes and what is lava?</p>
<img src="images/016.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>After years of studying the vibrations and what are called seismic waves, scientists have come to the conclusion that the earth has essentially three sections. The crust, the mantle and the core.</p>
<p>We live on the crust. With oceans and mountains and forests the crust is barely 40-60 km thick when the radius of the earth is 6500 km.</p>
<img src="images/017.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The core has two parts. Deep inside the earth is a solid hard core of nickel and iron with a radius of about 1300 km. The temperature of the core is nearly 4000&#9900;C, but the pressure inside is so large that it remains solid. Surrounding this solid core is molten iron and nickel more than 2280 km thick which is again surrounded by molten rock 2900 km thick. This is called mantle. Huge plates of rock float on the mantle carrying the continents and the oceans which make the crust. Some time molten rocks at about 1000-1500&#9900;C, gush out through some weak spots on the crust and turn into volcanoes.</p>
<p>The plates on which the continents rest are called continental plates which at some places keep moving, drifting very very slowly. You may be surprised to learn that once upon a time, India was a part of Africa. Then it drifted towards the north east and stopped when it pressed against China. The pressure was so enormous that huge mountains poured out and the Himalayas were formed. Amazing! Is it not?</p>
<p>As for earthquakes, when the shells or plates that drift, come close to each other, they may hit suddenly and the force is so large that the surface shakes and cracks. The buildings and bridges collapse. Huge chasms are formed and thousands of people may die as a result. The shock waves spread, hitting neighbouring towns and cities. Some of you may just about remember the earthquake in Gujarat in the year 2001. Thousands of people died as a result.</p>
<img src="images/018.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Like continental plates there are oceanic plates under the oceans. These are thinner than continental plates. When these plates break suddenly, one part of the plate may move up and the other down. An enormous body of water is suddenly displaced . A huge amount of potential energy is released and the displaced water carries the energy as waves rushing at about 700km/hour, i.e. nearly the speed of sound. The closer they come towards the shore the more the speed is reduced, the height of the waves increases and with tremendous energy they hit the shore and devastate whatever come in their way. This is called “Tsunami” in Japanese, meaning harbour waves. Tsunami takes place when oceanic plates move up or down or they are vertically displaced.</p>
<img src="images/019.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The solid core of the earth is a magnet and accounts for the earth’s magnetism. We shall talk about this later.</p>
<p>The present story is about what is inside the earth that causes volcanoes to spout fire and lava and the drifting and cracking of the plates on which our continents and oceans rest, leading to earthquakes and Tsunamis. When we talk about geothermal energy as a possible source of alternative energy, we shall refer to the mantle where stones and rocks melt and boil and how from the upper part of the mantle hot geysers gush out in tall columns and hot springs throw up water nice and hot.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">OUR EARTH IS A HUGE MAGNET</h1>
<figure>
<img src="images/021.jpg" alt="image"/>
<figcaption>Dr. William Gilbert</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A short piece of thin magnet, suspended from a string or supported on a pivot makes a magnetic compass which is believed to be a Chinese invention.</p>
<p>It changed the face of Western Europe and subsequently of the world. Lode stones having magnetic properties were known earlier and there were many myths associated with lode stones.</p>
<p>Europe was emerging in twelfth- thirteenth century A.D. from the Dark age that followed the glories of Greco-Roman civilization.</p>
<img src="images/022.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Sea voyages beckoned but they were not safe.</p>
<p>Imagine a ship, out in the Atlantic, with nothing to guide the sailors except the pole star or some other stars.</p>
<p>On an overcast night, there was no guiding star in view for the ancient navigators. Magnetic compasses came to their rescue. The Italian born Spanish explorer Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) sailed westward in the quest of the spice rich India and landed in America and that is how the West was discovered.</p>
<p>Vasco da Gama (1460-1524), the Portuguese explorer, succeeded in reaching India. Sea voyages increasingly became common and combined with the invention of fire arms (also a Chinese invention) led to colonization and brought a lot of wealth to Western Europe. Universities were set up as centres of knowledge. An illustrious product of Cambridge in England, during the realm of Queen Elizabeth 1, was William Gilbert. (1544-1603)</p>
<p>Gilbert was a physician by training and profession. Physics was his hobby. Because of his great reputation in medical practice, he was appointed the queen’s personal physician.</p>
<p>Dr. Gilbert seldom accepted myths and he asked basic questions.</p>
<p>One of the questions that bothered him was why should a compass needle point towards the North and South direction? He also observed that the needle was not horizontal. It dipped. The farther north he went the more it dipped.</p>
<p>“Is the earth itself a magnet?” asked Gilbert. He made a spherical magnet, called it “Terrella” and got a very tiny compass made. He observed that this tiny magnet behaved much the same way on the surface of the Terrella as an ordinary magnetic compass does on the surface of the earth. The tiny magnet pointed towards the poles of the spherical magnet and also dipped. At the poles the needle dipped by 90 degrees. His experiments proved quite convincingly that the earth is indeed a magnet but Gilbert did not, at that time, have an answer to the question of what makes the earth a magnet.</p>
<p>His book “<em>de magnete</em>” published in the year 1600, was an excellent scientific treatise and is still considered to be an outstanding study on magnets and static charges considering the time when it was written.</p>
<p>“What makes the earth a magnet?” The answer to this question is linked to what you learnt in the previous article. Remember you had learnt that the earth has a solid core and around it flows a thick layer of molten nickel and iron? The core of the earth is a magnet and a very strong one at that. This magnet produces what is known to be a magnetic field. This field <em>deflects</em> some of the harmful rays that come from the sun during solar flares. If the earth were not a magnet and these cosmic rays were to reach the earth, would life have been possible?</p>
<p><strong><em>Every thing seems to have been just right on this planet of ours so that life could start and we could evolve!.</em></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, we have written about William Gilbert at some length, since he was described as the father of electricity and magnetism. Queen Elizabeth liked her physician and admired his talents. She bequeathed a substantial amount of money to Dr. Gilbert to help set up a good library and laboratory. Gilbert continued as a Royal physician after the queen’s death in 1603. But not too long.</p>
<p>He fell a victim to Bubonic plague (1603) and sadly, his library and laboratory perished in the Great London Fire (1666).</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">THE BLUE FIRMAMENT THAT SHIELDS US</h1>
<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>It is a sphere of air and vapour. In fact that is the origin of the word <em>atmosphere</em> in Greek. (<em>atmos &#126; vapour, sphaira &#126; ball</em>). It is like a 4.5 meter thick concrete roof over this earth protecting us from all hazards that may come from the outer space, like harmful rays and meteors and keeps us nicely warm from freezing at -50&#9900;C, the temperature in the outer space. The gravitational pull of the earth prevents the gases from flying away since the earth keeps spinning at about 1675 km an hour at the equator, to go one round of nearly 40,000 km, the perimeter of the earth at the equator, in 24 hours. There is almost no matter in the space, no friction and the earth has not slowed down over billions of years. Remember Newton’s first law about inertia of rest and inertia of motion? It states “<em>Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by an external impressed force to change that state.</em>” If you kick a ball it comes to rest because friction causes it to stop.</p>
<img src="images/026.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The outer space is dark and cold although the electromagnetic waves, the visible light and the invisible infrared and other rays from the sun pass through the space. There is hardly any matter to reflect the light and make it visible since we see things only in reflected light. There is very little matter to absorb the heat, get warm and exchange heat.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is divided broadly into four unequal parts.</p>
<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.01">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">TROPOSPHERE</h2>
<p>The <em>Troposphere </em>stretches from sea level to about 16 km on the equator and 6 km on the poles, <em>an average </em>of 10km. This is the most important part of the atmosphere for us. This is where the clouds are formed, gases and water vapour get mixed (In Greek <em>trope </em>means overturn and that is what happens when the gases keep turning over) and provide the right combination of air for us with 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, argon, carbondioxide, water vapour and trace gases all adding up to about 1%. Jet planes usually fly at a height of 10km where the density of air is less than half of the density at sea level , the friction is less and less fuel is consumed. Turbulence is also minimum here.</p>
<img src="images/027.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>We hardly ever realize that we are at the bottom of an ocean of air which exerts a pressure of about 1kg per square centimetre on us at sea level, reducing as we go up. The force on your stretched palm due to the weight of the air would be about 125kgs. You do not feel the force because there is an equal and opposite force on the back of your palm cancelling it.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.02">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">STRATOSPHERE</h2>
<p>Beyond the Troposphere is the <em>Stratosphere </em>which stretches up to about 50 km. Nearly 90% of the ozone in the atmosphere is concentrated in this section and helps to protect us from the harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.03">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">MESOSPHERE</h2>
<p>The mesosphere stretches up to about 85km above sea level. This is where most meteors burn out due to friction on entering the atmosphere and it saves us from being bombarded by meteors.</p>
<p>The space shuttles have to be carefully monitored as they enter the atmosphere at about 17000 miles per hour, the temperature rising to about 1500&#9900;C due to friction and only specially made material can withstand such a temperature.</p>
<p>In the year 2003 the Columbia Space shuttle burnt out because of some fault and that is when Kalpana Chawla, the Indian Astronaut, lost her life.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.04">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">THERMOSPHERE</h2>
<p>The thermosphere stretches up to about 700 km. The air is highly rarefied here. The International space station orbits in this layer at about 320 - 380 km. This is where the <em>IONOSPHERE is mainly located.</em> This is where the atoms get <em>ionized</em> or electrically charged due to solar radiation (UV light).The Ionosphere helps to reflect long and medium range radio waves and send them around the curved surface of the earth.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Why is the sky blue?</h2>
<p>We cannot complete this article without briefly answering this question that often come to mind.</p>
<p>We have discussed electromagnetic rays and visible light which we all know is a spectrum of <em>VIBGYOR </em>When light waves pass through gas atoms and molecules they get scattered. Shorter the waves length the larger is the scattering.</p>
<p>Larger the wavelength lesser is the scattering.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why all danger signals are red?</p>
<p>Red waves being the longest visible wave are least scattered and can travel longer distances just as water waves in an ocean. Small water waves break down easily but long waves can travel long distances.</p>
<p>As white light comes directly from the sun, and meets with gas atoms and molecules up above, the violet and blue get scattered early and blue reaches our eyes from all directions of the dome giving the impression of a blue sky.When the sun sets, the sun being on the horizon, the solar rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere. Most colours get scattered and initially the western sky looks yellow and when the sun is further down and looks like an ellipse (do find out why), orange and red reach our eyes and make some sunsets so rich and resplendent.</p>

<img src="images/029.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>If you travel about 325km from Bangalore, either to the east or to the west you will see the blue seas. You see the Bay of Bengal if you go east and the Arabian sea if you travel west. They appear endless and seem to meet the sky in the horizon.</p>
<p>Winds sweep across them. Waves rise and keep rolling in and crashing on the shores. Surely, you know that oceans cover 70% of the earth and land mass covers barely 30%. From sea levels land may rise as mountains. Mount Everest stretches up to about 8.8km. The average depth of the oceans is about 3.5 km going as deep as 6 km at places. The Atlantic and the Pacific are the largest oceans and of course there are the Indian Ocean, Baltic ocean and a few others. The Pacific Ocean alone covers the same area as the land on earth. Nearly 97% of all the water is contained in the oceans, about 1.6% in the glaciers and ice caps and the rest in rivers and lakes and in the clouds.</p>
<img src="images/030.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Where did all this water come from? That is not an easy question to answer. It was believed earlier that the oceans must have originated from the steam in the atmosphere. As the earth cooled it rained for thousands of years and the oceans were formed. It was found later that the oceans hold much more water than the atmosphere could possibly provide.</p>
<p>It was then believed that under compression enough water came out of the mantle of the earth made of liquid rocks. Moisture from the molten rocks in the earth moved up and cooled and then it rained continuously and filled the craters to make the oceans. This is not believed to be entirely true either.</p>
<p>It was believed earlier that the moon has no water. Chandrayan, the Indian satellite sent to the moon detected the presence of water in the moon. Where did this water come from? The moon, because of its low gravitational attraction, does not have an atmosphere and it is constantly bombarded by celestial bodies. A number of scientists believe that water came to the moon, the distant planets of the solar system, in some of the moons in the Jupiter primarily from Comets and debris from space that constantly bombard the planets and the moons. Some water in our moon must have come with the matter that came from the earth.</p>
<p>Water on the earth, it is now believed, came primarily from outside. This is plausible since after the supernova explosion, stars in our galaxy and planets were formed from celestial debris. The volume of the earth is 800 times the volume of water in the oceans. If the earth could be formed from debris from space, so could the oceans. (<em>see the news item below</em>)</p>
<p>Water has many strange properties. For example, most liquids contract when they freeze, or the volume of the solid is lesser than its liquid form. Surprisingly, water contracts to its minimum volume at 4&#9900;C and then there is a sudden reversal and it expands, reaching a volume 10% higher than liquid water as it freezes into ice at 0&#9900;C In other words, ice is lighter than water and therefore it floats in water. Would you believe that this freak of Nature has enabled the earth to nurture life? If ice was heavier than water, it would sink. The bottom of the oceans would begin to get filled with ice and there would not be any floating ice blocks to keep the oceans reasonably warm for marine life to thrive. Had there been no marine life could life on earth ever begin? The surface of water is, however, warmer than it is deep down. At the tropics there may be a difference of 20 -25&#9900;C. This may be exploited for extracting energy.</p>
<p>Sea water, as we know is saline, and we cannot drink it. If you keep boiling sea water you would be left with common salt, which is sodium chloride.</p>
<p>If we drink sea water there would be excess salt in our system. That would eventually break up the cells that make our body and we would die. Many sea farers stranded in the oceans have died without water. Less salt in our system is equally hazardous. <strong><em>Indeed life hangs on a critical balance</em></strong>.</p>
<img src="images/031.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>From where do we get our drinking water? More than 10 billions of litres every day for all the people in the world! There is a beautiful cycle that goes on to provide salt free water for us. Solar heat produces water vapour from the oceans. Being lighter than air, vapour goes up and forms clouds and comes down in rains to form glaciers at the poles. Rains fill lakes, feed rivers and provide ground water which we draw, drink and stay alive.</p>
<p>Life is not possible without water: that simple chemical bond of two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen atom. Strange when you come to think of it!</p>
<p><em>A brief news item from the Times of India (24.4.13) </em></p>
<p class="myquote"><em>“The mysterious traces of water in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter came from a comet that smashed into the largest planet of the solar system in 1994, the European Space Agency (ESA)has found. ESA’s Herschel’s space observatory solved the long- standing mystery as to the origin of water in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, finding conclusive evidence that it was delivered by the dramatic impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy9 in July1994.”</em></p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">WIND POWER</h1>
<img src="images/032.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The Greeks believed that wind is nothing but the earth breathing in and out.</p>
<p>Wind was deified in the early civilizations. Vayu, Pavan, Marut were the names of wind gods in India, the Greeks had Boreas, the purple winged god of the North wind of the four directional Anemoi. Vayu is described as having exceptional beauty and moving noisily in his shiny coach driven by two or forty nine white and purple horses.</p>
<img src="images/033.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The Chinese had Feng Bo.</p>
<p>Mythologies are fascinating to read. Realities are somewhat dull in comparison. Still, let us get into it.</p>
<p>Remember we learnt that we are immersed in an ocean of air?</p>
<p>The air does not stand still, particularly since the earth is not heated uniformly by the solar rays that it receives. The equatorial and tropical regions receive heat more directly and are much hotter than the polar regions which are perennially covered by ice. As the air in the equatorial region becomes hot, it becomes lighter and moves upwards, almost up to the end of the troposphere leaving a low pressure belt below. At that high altitude the air gets cold and dense and moves towards the north and the south poles where low pressure belts are created as the cold and tense air from the poles move towards the low pressure region created at the tropics and the equator. The cooled air from troposphere comes to fill the airspace in the poles. The cycle is thus complete. <em>Wind is nothing but moving air.</em></p>
<img src="images/034.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The movement of air is not as simple as we have just described. It does not simply flow from the equator to due north and due south and back. Rotation of the earth affects its movement to a considerable extent, due to what is known as <strong>Coriolis effect</strong>. At the equator, the earth rotates at 1675 km an hour moving from west to east, dragging the atmosphere with it. As we move away from the equator to <em>higher latitudes</em>, to the north or to the south, the ground speed decreases, becoming almost zero at the poles (In Delhi the speed of the earth is about 1400km an hour.) <em>The earth rotates counterclockwise when observed from the North Pole and clockwise when observed from the South Pole</em>. At the North Pole, the air, instead of flowing due south, is deflected to the right and at the South Pole is deflected to the left. <em>Unlike buses, winds are named not by their destination but by their origins</em>. So the north wind becomes north-east wind (because that is what appears to be the origin of the north wind deflected to the right from its path from the north) Likewise, the wind from the South Pole appears to originate from the south-east. (<em>see below for further illustration of Coriolis effect</em>)</p>
<p>Add to it local factors like the presence of seas, lakes and mountains and forests all of which affect the movement of air. The picture gets more and more complicated due to seasonal variations caused by the 23.5 degree tilt of the earth and you know why the job of a meteorologist who makes weather forecasts, so hopelessly difficult since the moving air carries water vapour and causes rains and also affects the temperature.</p>
<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-009.01">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">THE MONSOONS</h2>
<p>Land masses get hotter or cooler faster than masses of water. During the hot months of summer in India, land mass of the Deccan area heats up considerably more quickly than the water in the Arabian Ocean. As the hot air from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra begins to rise, the cool air from the ocean begins to flow loaded with water vapour. It is the south - west monsoon which moves toward north and north- east during the months of June, July and early August. It causes <em>Monsoon rains</em> on which India’s agriculture depend heavily. During winter months, landmass of the country cools down while the water of the oceans still remains warm and makes a low pressure belt. North-east wind begins to blow towards South- west. A section of the wind collects water vapour from the Bay of Bengal and rains on the Deccan Plateau. This gives the <em>winter monsoon rains</em>.</p>
<img src="images/035.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Monsoons give us food. The summer monsoon some time causes devastating floods, especially in Bengal and Assam.</p>
<p>Winds take surprisingly different forms! From gentle breeze to catastrophic tornadoes! Hence perhaps the concept of forty nine horses of Vayu.</p>
<p>There was a time when winds were the only means of navigation across the oceans. Trade winds were generally used for navigation for trading purposes. Then there are the cyclones and typhoons that cause devastation.</p>
<p>What is the source of wind energy? It is the Sun again. The enormous heat engines that carry heat and water from one place to another with the help of winds is driven by the SUN.</p>
<p><strong>Gaspard-Gustave Corioli</strong></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">CORIOLIS EFFECT:</h2>
<p><em>Let us assume there is a target T on the equator, to be shelled from the North Pole. The shell is hurled due south along the longitude where T is located. Since both the shell and the target rotate with the earth, it is expected that the shell will hit the target. Will it? Let us see</em>.</p>
<p>As the shell S takes off, it is subjected to three forces. One, the force along the longitude due to the firing of the cannon , the other is the gravitational pull and the shell takes a parabolic path due to these two forces and is expected to land on the target. There is, however, a third force due to the rotation of the earth imparted to the shell by the atmosphere which,( due to the earth’s gravity), moves with the ground and drags the shell with it . As we have stated earlier, the ground speed changes, being almost zero at the Pole and being 1675km/hr at the equator. As the shell takes off from the Pole, <em><strong>the effect of the third force on it is minimal, increasing slowly as the shell approaches the equator where the ground speed is maximum</strong>. The target, right from the start, had kept moving at the maximum speed, being located at the equator, and the shell which had a slow start sidewise would fall behind, unable to catch up and <strong>will miss the target</strong><em>.</p>
<p>To an observer at O, the shell will appear not to have come from the north, heading due south, but will appear to have come from north-east because he sees that the shell lands behind i.e. west of the target T. Let us remind ourselves that, observed from the North Pole, the earth rotates counter-clockwise. Same thing will happen if the shell is targeted from the South Pole It will appear to come from south-east moving westward.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">THE GENTLE GIANT</h1>
<img src="images/037.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>The boats were made of Papyrus, a kind of dry reed. There were sails which caught the wind and the boats travelled along the Nile. There were also slaves who rowed when the wind dropped. That was more than 5000 years ago. The Egyptians were possibly among the first ancient civilizations to use sails and utilise wind power to travel along zivers and cross the seas. The Harappans of the Indus valley, at the mature stage of their civilizations around the same time also used small ships and sails.</p>
<p>The sails and the masts were made more and more sophisticated and robust to help travel across the direction of wind flow if required. The size of the boats and the number of sails employed kept increasing.</p>
<img src="images/038.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Mariners kept finding out the best routes where the wind blew towards their destination and avoided doldrums (<em>calm areas within +5&#9900; and -5&#9900; of the equator where the wind is often still</em>). The wind returning from the poles and shifted by the earth’s rotation, (the Coriolis effect), helped navigation and helped trades. The trade winds blow predominantly from North East in the northern hemisphere and South East in the southern hemisphere. The trade winds have been used by sailing ships to cross the oceans for centuries. As has been described earlier, armed with a magnetic compass the Europeans established trade routes across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, trading with some countries and often plundering and colonizing others. Sea worthy steamships began to replace sailing ships only after the latter part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. By then the British had established their empire in the West and the East, including in India, crossing the oceans in sailing ships.</p>
<p>There were other uses of wind power. Windmills were used for threshing and grinding wheat for centuries. Even now they are used in a number of Greek islands for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Wind can be very deceptive. Its speed may vary from a gentle breeze at 10km an hour to a giant killer at 300 to even 400km/hour.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy associated with a moving body varies as the square of its speed. In other words, the power of a body of a <em>fixed mass</em>, moving at 100 km/hour is 100 times that of the same body moving at 10 km/hour.</p>
<p><em>In the case of moving air the mass is not a constant. It varies directly as the velocity. The power of wind is, therefore, proportional to the cube of its velocity. The power of wind travelling at 200 km/hour is 4000 times that of wind at 10 km/hour.</em></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">CYCLONE</h2>
<p>It was on the 8<sup>th</sup> of November 1970 that a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal started forming, slowly pushing North towards Bangladesh as it grew and partly moving towards the Sunderban area of West Bengal. A cyclone may be formed when the temperature of the sea is around 26 deg. Hot air rises and begins to swirl in the same direction as the earth’s motion, (anti-clockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere) The velocity of this November cyclone towards Bangladesh reached a speed of about 190km/hour and started pushing further towards the North East. Sea water churned by the cyclonic swirl became monstrous and surged ahead, destroying whatever came in the way. The storm abated after three days. By that time the devastation was complete. Many villages perished. Almost 500,000 people died.</p>
<p>A more recent incidence of cyclone was in the month of May 2010 which struck Andhra Pradesh. The cyclone named Laila (<em>Arabic for Night</em>). On 17 May, it formed on the Bay of Bengal from a persistent area of convection when air becomes hot and moves up It gathered strength as it moved North West and its speed reached up to 120 km/hour. It made landfall near Bapatla in AP and after causing considerable damage, the cyclone dissipated itself on land.</p>
<p>Cyclones are also common in the Atlantic Ocean. A tropical cyclone is usually referred to as hurricane in the Atlantic. The name <em>hurricane</em> seems to have been derived from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind called Huracan. One of the relatively recent incidents of hurricane was the <em>Hurricane Katrina</em> in the year 2005. It formed in the Bahamas and crossed to the Gulf of Mexico and the Southern United States. A cyclone or a hurricane lasts for 2-6 days. Hurricane Katrina resulted in about 2000 deaths as well as causing a significant destruction of property. Although cyclones and hurricanes cause terrible damage of life and property, they help in distributing heat across the troposphere.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">TORNADOES</h2>
<p>A Tornado is a violent and dangerous rotation of a column of air that stretches from the surface of the earth to the cloud and shaped like a funnel, it rotates as cyclones do, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the South. They may cause devastation, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh. Typically a tornado travels at about 180km/hour. It is also commonly known as a Twister since it keeps twisting itself.</p>
<p>Cyclones, hurricanes and tornadoes, may have devastating effects as history has repeatedly shown, and keeps showing from time to time. They have smashed and destroyed many ships but gentle winds have carried many more across the oceans. Short of taking proper precautions, we can do nothing to control winds. Better prediction of an impending cyclone or tornado has been very helpful in saving lives, especially of fishermen at sea.</p>

<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">A CAVE TELLS OF DARKNESS</h1>
<img src="images/041.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p><em>KENTS CAVERN </em>is a long cave formed underground in Torquay in the south of England about 400 million years ago. It was discovered over 180 years back. Bones and jaw bones found in the cave showed that homo sapiens and neanderthals lived there along with bears and other predators</p>
<p>It was a very sunny day outside when we entered the cave. We were led deeper and deeper inside by the guide who used a powerful torchlight to show the path. All on a sudden the guide turned off the light. It became pitch dark like I had never seen before. There was a hushed silence! All we could hear was the sound of dripping water as it has been dripping for thousands of years. The darkness seemed impenetrable. Just as suddenly as he had turned off the light, the guide struck a match and held it over what looked like a plate. Almost instantly, the cave lighted up.</p>
<img src="images/042.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>“This is a sea shell” said our guide. Our ancestors filled shells like these with dry moss and animal fat and struck a fire using two pieces of marble. It took them many thousand years to learn this. Until then they lived in the pitch darkness that you experienced just now. Can you now imagine what transition it must have made to their lives when they learnt the use of fire for having sustained lighting? They had already learnt the use of fire for cooking. Making a fire for the purpose of cooking by using a special variety of dry wood or by striking pieces of marble was a great step forward in human civilization when ancient humans learnt to control fire rather than be scared by it like all other animals. To be able to cook meat in a lighted cave and be able to fend off predators with fire was followed by the next step of being able to make weapons out of sharp pieces of stone that they could collect in the lighted cave. Fixing them to a long piece of wood was the next step forward.</p>
<p>“When and how did they learn cooking?” was a question from a young boy in the group.</p>
<p>“That must have been an accidental discovery. If a fire started in a forest, many animals would get burnt and the homo sapiens who escaped found that roasted meat of burnt animals tasted better than raw meat. When it happened is somewhat difficult to say.”</p>
<p>“Could a fire start on its own?” was the persistent question from the same boy.</p>
<p>“Yes, it could and it still does. If two dry branches keep rubbing against each other, heat caused by friction may easily start a fire. Sometimes, sunrays passing through a drop of water that act like a lens may fall on dry leaves and start a fire.” said the guide</p>
<p>Out of the caves, into the sunny holiday resort, we stopped for a meal at a restaurant and watched a barbeque being cooked. Things have remained so much the same in so many respects and I could not help thinking how hundreds of thousand years later, women in our country still collect firewood, the most primitive medium for cooking, and about 400 million people still do not have access to electricity and have to depend on lamps to light up dark nights. The only difference is that they use kerosene and not animal fat for their lamps.</p>
<p>Fire is the oldest form of energy that humans have been using. Wind has been used much later. Fire has been burning inside the earth ever since its creation and still does. Volcanoes underneath the oceans and above the earth spew fire. But these fires are destructive and except from a very long term perspective it is of no use for us. Apart from cooking or being used for fighting, fire had little use until metals began to be used by smelting with fire. Smelting ushered in the Bronze Age (3300BCE-1200BCE) and Iron age (around 1100 BCE) and human civilization took yet another giant leap forward.</p>
<p>One of the longest leaps was in boiling water and using the power of steam. This was started more than 2000 years ago but possibly not put into practical use.</p>
<p>From Torquay we boarded a train pulled by a steam engine that was about 100 years old. There was a big boiler and coal was continually fed into the fire that heated water. Black smoke continuously came out of the chimney.</p>
<img src="images/043.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p>Out of the train, we boarded a steamer that brought us to Dartmouth. There, inside a park, is preserved a model of the first Newcomen engine. Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) with his assistant John Calley, invented what came to be known as the first steam engine which some believe was the precursor to the Industrial Revolution. The Newcomen engine was intended for pumping out water from inside the coal mines. Coal was widely used at that time for heating, cooking and for industrial furnaces. It was however not a very efficient machine and was superseded by the engine made by James Watt (1736-1819). Steam locomotives were slowly developed and by nineteenth century became the main mode of transportation along with steamers.</p>
<p>The most important use of fire in modern days is the production of steam for driving turbines that run generators to produce electricity. All these will be discussed in detail later as we talk about the production of electricity that has now become the main source of energy for lighting, heating or cooling, our rooms and also widely for cooking purposes.</p>
<p>Thousands of years have passed since our ancestors used to sit in caves, lighting them by burning animal fat on dried moss while cooking on wood fire. Extravagant energy use by some of us is presenting problems that we shall address later.</p>
<p>What we have done in our story telling so far is to describe briefly the five classical elements that according to our ancient scriptures considered constituted this world. They are:</p>
<p>Kshiti (the earth), Byom (the sky), Ap (water), Marut (Wind) and Agni (Fire) and above all the Surya, the SUN the ultimate source of most of our energy.</p>
<img src="images/044.jpg" alt="image"/>
<p class="myquote"><strong>Thomas Newcomen</strong> (shortly before 24 February 1664 – 5 August 1729) created the first practical steam engine for pumping water, the Newcomen steam engine. He was an ironmonger  by trade. He was born in Dartmouth, Devon, England, near a part of the country noted for its tin  mines. Flooding was a major problem, limiting the depth at which the mineral could be mined. Newcomen’s great achievement was his steam engine, probably developed about 1710, combining the ideas of Thomas Savery  and Denis Papin. The ‘fire engine’ was not very effective and could not work beyond a limited depth of around thirty feet. Newcomen replaced the receiving vessel (where the steam was condensed) with a cylinder containing a piston. Instead of the vacuum drawing in water, it drew down the piston. This was used to work a beam engine, in which a large wooden beam rocked upon a central fulcrum. On the other side of the beam was a chain attached to a pump  at the base of the mine. As the steam cylinder was refilled with steam, readying it for the next power stroke, water was drawn into the pump cylinder and expelled into a pipe to the surface by the weight of the machinery. Newcomen and his partner John Calley  built one of the first engines at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley  in the West Midlands. A working replica of this engine can be seen at the Black Country Living Museum  nearby.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">THE BURIED LIGHT</h1>
<p>As we came out of the <em>400 million year old </em>dark caves of the <em>Kents Cavern, </em>into a bright sunshine,<em> </em>there was a pleasant breeze blowing outside. Tall eucalyptus trees in the forest nearby swayed in the wind.</p>
<p>“Were there any trees and forests here 400 million years back?” I wondered. It is difficult to say but near about this time, may be a few million years later, plants had begun to grow on land. First there were green algae and later seeds and still later plants evolved.</p>
<p>How life was formed from the various chemicals like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, about two billions of years ago is another story. Chlorophylls had most certainly formed earlier. Chlorophyll is a biomolecule. In Greek, <em>chloros </em>is green and <em>phyllon </em>is leaf. This pigment is a poor absorber of Green and the near green portions of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These are abundantly present in leaves. Since Chlorophyll is a poor absorber of Green, leaves usually look green since an object reflects the colour it cannot absorb.</p>
<p>Chlorophyll is vital for <em>PHOTOSYNTHESIS</em>. It helps to convert carbon dioxide (CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>) and water (H<span><sub>2</sub></span>O) into Glucose (C<span><sub>6</sub></span>H<span><sub>12</sub></span>O<span><sub>6</sub></span>) and Oxygen in the presence of light. This process has been going on in nature for millions of years, helping algae to grow into plants and for plants to grow bigger and bigger as a storehouse of energy absorbed from light energy from the Sun as may be described by the simple chemical equation:</p>
<p>6 CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>+ 6 H<span><sub>2</sub></span>O  C<span><sub>6</sub></span>H<span><sub>12</sub></span>O<span><sub>6</sub></span>+6O<span><sub>2</sub></span></p>
<p>Light</p>
<p>This apparently simple chemical reaction is of unusual importance. It provides food for plants to grow and converts carbon dioxide into oxygen which is the breath of life. The Green leaves of the plants and the green grass help to feed us and produce oxygen that keeps us alive.</p>
<p>About 300 million years ago, trees that had grown, and died after some years fell and sunk in swamps. Being buried under water they were cut off from Oxygen and did not decay or get destroyed by insects. Under pressure, these formed what is called <em>PEAT. </em>With time, the water inside the buried trees or the Peat was continuously squeezed out and the Peat increasingly hardened and the percentage of Carbon kept increasing in the process. Layers were formed over layers and coals of different varieties were formed.</p>
<p>The soft brown varieties are the <em>Lignite </em>which have 25-35% of Carbon and 35% of water, the next is <em>Sub-bituminous</em> coal with 35-45% of carbon, the next layer is <em>Bituminous Coal </em>with 45-85% Carbon and <em>Anthracite </em>is the hardest variety with 85-90% Carbon content and they were buried with all the energy in <em>Sunlight </em>the trees had absorbed millions of years earlier.</p>
<p>Coal was not used as a fuel until relatively recently. But Charcoal has been used as early as 5000 B.C.</p>
<p>“What is charcoal?” Charcoal is formed when wood is slowly burnt in the absence of oxygen. In early years charcoal used to be made by burning wood in shallow hearths covered by earth. Wood burnt slowly and the moisture was removed leaving almost pure carbon.</p>
<p>Some spectacular cave drawings in charcoal as far back as 30,000 years have been discovered. It is unlikely that men knew how to make charcoal in those days or put it to any other use. Probably, charcoal was picked up by them from where trees had got burnt in some forest fire.</p>
<p>As has been stated earlier there is evidence however, that charcoal was used as a fuel as early as 5000 B.C. The use of Charcoal significantly increased when metal extraction came to be known. Bronze age, referred to earlier, demanded high temperatures, much higher than about 800<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-"> <\/a><\/sup></span>deg.C that burning wood could provide. Charcoal could provide 300 deg.C more. The Iron age (1100 B.C. onwards) increased the need of an enormous amount of charcoal and special forests were cultivated for growing trees for making charcoal. The Greeks and later the Romans during the first centuries A.D., began producing huge amounts of iron, both for arms and sculptures and developed sophisticated methods of producing charcoal.</p>
<p>Charcoal tars found much use in house building and also in ship building as useful joiner and in view of the absorptive capacity of charcoal it began to be used for purifying air and water and other chemicals.</p>
<p>The major use of charcoal was still for fuel and for metal production until the nineteenth century when concerns were expressed about the use of thousands of acres of agricultural land for growing trees for charcoal production when the technology for Coke production from relatively low grade Bituminous coal was invented.</p>
<p>In England, coal fields were discovered in various places. New Castle was one of them. The discovery of a huge source of energy stored underground spurred on industrial activities. New tools were invented for going deeper. Steam engines were invented and we have already mentioned the first <em>NEWCOMEN ENGINES </em>that began to be used for pumping out mine water. As time passed, coal began to be used as the main source of energy. The use of coal in rail engines changed transport system. Animal power was replaced by steam power obtained by burning coal and <em>INDUSTRIAL </em><em>REVOLUTION WAS USHERED IN. </em>With abundant coal underground and steam power from engines made by innovative engineers, Britain surged ahead of other countries. Railways were set up in various colonies including India. The first passenger train in India chugged out of Bori Bunder in Bombay to Thane in the year 1853.</p>
<p>Today, Indian Railways transport over 7 billion passengers a year.</p>

<p><strong>STEAM ENGINES AND THE</strong></p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>James Watt</strong></p>
<p>As we stepped into the boat moored at some point at the bank of the Chester Canal, I found a leaflet lying on a table inside the boat describing the origins of this canal. It read as follows: “Started in 1772, at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the Chester Canal was intended to link the city of Chester with growing centres of industry and trade and also the midlands.” The canals were dug for carrying goods and passengers from one part of the country to another. Barges were loaded with goods and horses were harnessed to pull them. On the Ganga and on other rivers in India big boats were used to transport goods. Sher Shah Suri had the Grand Trunk road re-built during the 16th century (which has been now modernized and stretches from Guahati to Amritsar). Horses and elephants were used for transporting goods.</p>
<p>The Industrial revolution (1760-1850) is believed to have started in England after animal power began to be replaced by steam power.</p>
<p>Coal mining had become a major activity at that time. Coal appeared to offer an endless source of energy. Conversion of coal into coke was a major achievement in that even low grade coal could be used in industries which began to flourish. Iron industry thrived and with it other metal industries.</p>
<p>It so happened that many innovators with great enterprise appeared on the industrial scene. Automation increased production. Textile industries thrived. Steam began to be used increasingly but not effectively. Mining industries, especially for coal and iron demanded a huge labour force. Men, women and even children used to go down into the mines for digging the ores and even carrying them up on their backs. Underground water often flooded the mines and they had to be manually carried out. Most of the labourers lived near the mines and industries in appalling conditions and they had to put in nearly twelve hours of labour a day for small wages. The Newcomen engines, referred to in an earlier section was a blessing. It particularly helped in pumping out water from the mines.</p>
<p>Newcomen engines were indispensable but were inefficient. It would be said that a Newcomen engine needed an iron mine to make and a coal mine to run it. It was James Watt who appeared on the scene and significantly improved the efficiency of steam engines.</p>
<p>James Watt (1736-1819) was a Scottish instrument maker. He could not attend school in view of his poor health and was taught by his mother at home. It is said that James Watt used to watch the kettle in the kitchen while he had his lessons from his mother and got interested in the power of steam. While he was working as an instrument repairer in the University of Glasgow, he was deputed to repair a Newcomen engine. While working on it, James Watt instinctively realized that a Newcomen engine was grossly inefficient because it threw out and wasted much of the hot steam produced.</p>
<p>James Watt designed a much improved version with an additional condenser to avoid wasting hot steam and with the help of partners he made an improved version of steam engine which was patented. It is believed that, “James Watt’s improvement to the steam engines converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<p>James Watt was not only a mechanical engineer but also a chemist and made significant contributions to Thermodynamics. His services were acknowledged by naming the unit of power as “watt” as in a 60 watt or 100 watt electric bulb or a 500 mega watt generator.</p>
<p>The James Watt engine was not adapted to run as a locomotive. There were a number of innovative engineers trying to make steam locomotives. Perhaps the most useful and efficient of these turned out to be the ROCKET ENGINE made by George Stephenson (1781-1848)</p>
<p>Stephenson could not go to school and was virtually illiterate until the age of 18. His father was a poor miner who made 15 shillings a week and support a large family. George Stephenson used to work for a pittance to eke out the family income. At the age of 14 he started working in the mine . He was highly innovative and since mines are filled with dangerous flammable gases, Stephenson made a safety lamp totally unaware that Sir Humphry Davy was involved in making what came to be known as the “Davy’s safety lamp.”</p>
<p>George started attending evening classes to educate himself. A few years later, with the help and support of the owner of the mine, he developed a steam locomotive to lift coal from the mine. By the year 1830, with relentless efforts and great ingenuity, Stephenson made steam locomotives that could run at 29 m.p.h. George Stephenson died in 1848. By then Steam locomotives had spread in England, Europe and America. In India the first train started in 1853. By March, 2011, 1,20,000 kms of railway lines have been laid</p>
<p>When we were young, steam engines were the only ones that were used. Diesel or Electric locomotives had not come into the market. Coal was continuously fed into a fire to make steam in boilers and the steam used as effectively as possible in those days to haul a train of carriages. Smoke and coal dust were continuously thrown up. By the time we reached our destination we would be covered with coal dust. In those days no one seemed to worry about atmospheric pollution.</p>
<p>Coal engines, the great discovery of Newcomen, James Watt , George Stephenson that ushered in the Industrial revolution and changed the face of the world were slowly phased out all over the world and replaced by diesel and electric engines.</p>
<p>The last major steam locomotive in India puffed out in 1984.</p>

<p><strong>THE ETERNAL FLAME</strong></p>
<p>The word ‘mumiya’ in Arabic means bitumen and the word ‘mummy’ is said to have been derived from it. You can see the pictures of mummies, especially the Egyptian mummies on your computer. More than 6000 years back, some of the dead humans. mainly from royal households, were mummified all over the world and particularly in Egypt, wishing immortality for the departed. Bitumen that would ooze out of the earth in certain places in Egypt, Greece, Israel, Russia and several other places and turn into pitch was found to be a very good preservative and used for making mummies. It was also a good binder for securing wooden structures as a joiner. In many countries and India was no exception, Temples were constructed around eternal flames which were nothing other than a copious flow of oil or gas (mainly methane) from under the earth. Once ignited oil or methane, a flammable gas, would continue to burn and awe-struck worshippers deified these flames as something divine.</p>
<p>We have seen how coal was formed over millions of years from trees buried in swamps and being fossils of trees, coal is classified as a “fossil fuel” and so are crude oil and gas formed from organic materials buried under the ocean-beds. Organic materials called zooplankton and algae that grew absorbing solar energy give up the solar energy in the form of heat and light millions of years later when we burn a candle or use a gas oven. Some believe that carcasses of sea animals also contribute towards the formation of oil. As sand and mud accumulate on the organic materials these are “cooked’ in heat and under pressure in the absence of oxygen to make what is called “Kerogen”. The kerogen molecules eventually break into shorter and lighter molecules made almost entirely of carbon and hydrogen.</p>
<p>If there is more gaseous content, it forms natural gas and if it is mainly liquid, it forms what we call “crude oil’ a black and waxy material. The crude oil and gas when formed under pressure and heat ooze through porous rocks and rest in traps of what are called sedimentary rocks.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the name <em>Petroleum</em> is derived from the words <em>Petra </em>(Greek for stone) and <em>Oleum </em>(Latin for Oil). So the source of oil was well-known. The Chinese were drilling oil from relatively short depths of about 800 ft. with bamboo poles as early as 300 century A.D. and burning this to extract salt from sea water and much earlier than this, the Egyptians used pitch as preservatives and binders, the Persians paved the roads with pitch in 8<span><sup>th</Sup></span> century and it is believed the Chinese and Japanese began using gas for heating and lighting as early as the 9<span><Sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> century.</p>
<p>You may have heard of Marco Polo the famous traveler and he wrote during his visit to the Azerbaijani city of Baku on the Caspian Ocean in 1264, that he saw shiploads of oil being produced there. It is interesting that in 1806 some engineers in the U.S. in West Virginia were drilling wells for brine or salt water to be used for some medicinal purposes and were annoyed when they found some black oily mass mixed with brine. They were annoyed and abandoned the wells. They did not realize that the oily mass would one day provide petroleum which is now called liquid gold. The first well for oil in the states was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859.</p>
<p>Both crude oil and natural gas are mixtures of various compounds. Natural gas is a compound of methane, ethane, propane and butane. These may be described by the simple chemical formula C<span><sub>n</sub></span> H<span><sub>2n+2</sub></span>, n being 1,2,3 etc.methane being CH<span><sub>4</sub></span>, the simplest of them. Oil is made of various complex compounds and these may be separated by what is called fractional distillation. When the oil is heated petrol having the lowest boiling point evaporates first and is separated and condensed to provide what is called the aviation fuel, at slightly higher temperature the petrol used for motor cars separates out, then diesel then kerosene and the last in the list is bitumen that we have talked about in the beginning. In the middle of the nineteenth century, petrol was not in demand but kerosene became very popular since it was cheaper than <em>whale oil </em>used for lighting. Different distillates of oil are used for various medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>In England and also in some of the cities in India gas was being used widely for street lighting. In some affluent homes gas would be piped in for cooking purposes. Aeroplanes were widely used in the second world war (1939-1943), marginally for postal purposes but not very widely for passenger services. Motor cars were very limited and only the very affluent people in India could afford motor cars. Horse-drawn carriages were common as you may have seen in some old movies. Tram cars had been introduced in cities like Calcutta and public buses had just about started. Cycle and hand-drawn rickshaws were common modes of travel for personal use and are still prevalent in many towns and cities in our country.</p>
<p>From 1950 s there was a dramatic change in the use of oil all over the world and the use of coal for transport and heating became less as years passed. The use of oil for aviation has increased dramatically. Motor cars and two wheelers have made travelling dangerous as you see in any of our cities. These use plenty of oil apart from the atmospheric pollution they cause.</p>
<p>Are we not running out of petrol? We are, unless some options are found or what some Russian scientists have been saying about the earth being a huge store of <em>abiogenic oil</em> that may be stored deep inside the earth.We shall touch upon this in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>END OF OIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>“EARTH PROVIDES ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVERY MAN’S NEEDS,NOT EVERY MAN’S GREED’ </strong></p>
<p><em>Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
<p>You will be amazed when I tell you that all over the world, we consume about 13 billion litres of oil every day. (Have you ever thought how long it will take you to count up to one billion? It will take you more than 12 years of non-stop counting to count one billion.) This huge amount of oil and more are being pumped out by us from inside the earth every day, partly to meet our needs, partly to indulge in our extravagance, our love of speed and comfort and sadly, to a significant extent, for defense purposes.</p>
<p>We seldom stop to think that the oil reserve which took millions of years to accumulate is being squandered by us and will run out in less than 70 years in the middle east where a huge amount of oil is stored and in about 30 years in the rest of the world. Libya, Venezuela, USA, Russia are some of the relatively oil rich countries but considerably less rich than Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq. India’s oil reserve, as identified so far, is poor.</p>
<p>Apart from the thoughtless exploitation of oil, finishing off in 125 years what Nature had taken over millions of years to make, we need to take serious note of the <em>Greenhouse Gases</em> that have been resulting from burning oil, gas and coal.</p>
<p>It is difficult to figure out how we end up using 13 billion litres every day! That would mean each person on earth uses on an average 2 litres of oil every day! That can’t be true!</p>
<p>It does not work out that way. First, various chemicals are extracted from crude oil. Main fuel guzzlers are cars and aeroplanes. Power generation also takes a fair amount of gas and petrol.</p>
<p>Can you guess how much aviation fuel is used by a plane carrying say 400 passengers from Bombay to London (7200km) in a non-stop flight? It would be about 65,000 litres, each passenger using up 160 litres in 9 hours! But he covers 45km for one litre of petrol which makes flying much cheaper than travelling in a car even with three passengers! Isn’t that surprising?</p>
<p>However, it is only a limited number of people in a developing country who can travel in a car or fly. A very large number have marginal access to oil and use may be a few litres of oil in a month to light up their dark nights.</p>
<p>Of all countries, US is the largest consumer of oil (almost 3 billion litres a day) and was the largest polluter of the atmosphere until overtaken by China recently.</p>
<p>In India we use approximately 480 million litres every day. It was almost 100 years ago that oil was found in Digboi in Assam. One of the largest producers of oil in India is the Bombay High field in the Arabian sea producing nearly 50% of India’s indigenous production of crude oil. A large amount of oil has to be imported by us and the price of oil in India is one of the highest in the world. The import of oil causes a great strain on India’s economy.</p>
<p>Since oil is preferred to coal for transport, its demand has been increasing and possibly oil will run out sooner than we anticipate. Coal continues to be used widely for power generation and atmospheric pollution has been going on unabated. These issues have been engaging international attention for some years but no solution seems to be round the corner.</p>
<p>In India explorations have been going on to find more indigenous oil and help our economy by reducing oil import. Apart from explorations in various coastal areas, explorations are on in Assam and in Northern Assam. In this context, it may be interesting to note that in Borholla, Assam, the possibilities of <em>abiogenic fuel</em> have been suspected.</p>
<p>What is <em>abiogenic fuel</em> ? We have described in our earlier article how oil and gas have been formed from degradation of ancient biological substances such as algae which grew in sunlight and is called <em>biogenic fuel</em> due to their biological origin.</p>
<p>There were suggestions in the early 16<span><sup>th</Sup></span> century that there may be oil available that do not have biological origin. The same suggestion from Russian scientists was made in the 19<span><Sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> century and the latest in 1951 that hydrocarbons were there in the mantle at the time of formation of the earth which produced huge amounts of petroleum trapped deep down under impervious rocks like granite. The theory of petroleum of <em>abiogenic origin </em>has not been accepted by a large number of geophysicists but is mentioned here in view of the enormous possibilities it holds out if it comes to be true.</p>
<p>Whether oil and gas are <em>biogenic or abiogenic</em> in origin, the largest part of the end product after use will be CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>, one of the main gases producing <em>Green house effect</em>.</p>
<p><strong>GREENHOUSE EFFECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you been inside a Green House? In Bengaluru, in Lalbagh, there is a sort of a Green House where temperature higher than ambient temperature is maintained. Sun light comes through the glass and absorbed by the soil. The re- emitted infra red does not flow out easily and the temperature inside increases, helping certain types of plants to grow. (Green houses are fairly common in the US and Europe where moist atmosphere at temperatures higher than the ambient are maintained to help tropical plants to grow.)</p>
<p>Burning of coal, oil and gas have been producing huge amounts of water vapour, CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> and methane (CH<span><sub>4</sub></span>) which accumulate in the atmosphere that re-emits infra red, resulting in temperature rise. Although the mechanisms are somewhat different from what happens in a Green house, the analogy caught on. Studies over decades do indicate that the average temperature of our planet is slowly going up. This may cause the ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic to melt with devastating consequences threatening this planet.</p>
<p>Other products of carbon have been causing a different kind of damage to our planet. We have mentioned in an earlier chapter how layers of ozone in our Stratosphere protects us from adverse effects of ultraviolet rays. Production of CFCs or Chloroflurocarbons for refrigerators made holes in our ozone layers, letting in undesirable amounts of ultraviolet rays creating health hazards.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier , several accidents helped our planet, the Mother earth, to nurture life. As her most intelligent inhabitants can we afford to destroy life in this privileged planet? We have to make determined efforts, cutting across national boundaries and rising above politics to protect our planet from man-made disaster.</p>

<p><strong>THE OIL-GUZZLERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>STORIES OF THEIR INVENTION</strong></p>	
<p>It was amazing! Searching for the history of Internal Combustion or IC engines, to find among hundreds of names, the name of Tipu Sultan.(1750-1799),the Tiger of Mysore who fought the British army of the East India Company and gave his life, fighting to the end, in a treacherous war. What would Tipu have to do with IC engines? Not the IC engines for automobiles that we are going to discuss. His rockets which terrified the British were, in a way, an IC engine since the gun powder used in his rockets had a combustion chamber in which gunpowder would be burnt .The enormous thrust so produced would hurl a rocket to a great distance.</p>
<p>The early automobiles were driven by steam and not by internal combustion.</p>
<p>These were tried out in the continent and also in England where a legislation sealed their fate. In order to ensure the safety of pedestrians a man with a flag was required to walk in front of a car which travelled at about 3 miles per hour. Obviously, these cars were not very popular. It is interesting to note that while steam engines were mainly developed in Britain as described in an earlier chapter, IC engines and automobiles were developed mainly in Germany.</p>
<p>IC engines began to be developed towards the end of the nineteenth century Initially, coal gas was used, to be replaced later by gasoline. What are IC engines? In essence, in an IC engine a mixture of gasoline and air is injected into a cylinder and compressed by a piston, when an electric spark ignites the gasoline it tries to expand and the high pressure generated pushes the piston down to do mechanical work. Chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy.</p>
<p>A four stroke IC Engine was developed by the German inventor Nikolaus August Otto (1832-91) after twenty years of intensive research and the important particulars of this are the same as the petrol engine of today. This was called the “silent Otto” gas engine. A four stroke engine comprises 1) Downward intake stroke: where gas and air enter the piston chamber 2) Upward Compression where the piston compresses the mixture 3) Downward Power stroke when Electric spark ignites the fuel mixture and as the hot gas expands it delivers power 4) Upward Exhaust stroke: releases burnt gas from the piston chamber.</p>
<p>There were two other Germans who came up with improved and better versions of Otto’s four stroke engines. They were Karl Friedrich Benz (1844-1929) and the Gatlieb Daimler (1834-1900), both around the same time.</p>
<p>Nikolaus Otto had used coal gas . Benz and Daimler used gasoline. Benz invented the carburetor for fuel and air injection. His obsession with cycles possibly led him to produce three wheeled automobiles ( looking much like the rickshaws) with light IC engines mounted on the shaft. Karl Benz got a patent for his automobile in 1888. Benz is immortalized in Mercedes Benz, one of the most popular cars in Europe.</p>
<p>Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900), a workaholic and a relentless perfectionist who drove himself and his co-workers mercilessly made the modern four wheeled motor car driven by Otto’s four stroke IC engine, powered by gasoline. He made his machines particularly light and small and fitted one to a bicycle producing the first motor bike in the world. Daimler, it is said, hated driving and never drove one of his cars.</p>
<p>One person who cannot be left out of this episode is Bertha Benz, wife of Karl Benz who became quite familiar with the engineering details of her husband’s invention and one morning in 1888,without telling anything to her husband Bertha set off for her mother’s house 106 km away, with her two sons in their “motorwagen” which had never been taken for a long run. There were technical problems which she fixed herself. At a steep slope along the way, the brakes did not hold so well. She stopped and got hold of a shoe maker to nail leather straps on the brake blocks. That was the first time ever that brake shoes were made. When she reached her mother’s home she sent a telegram to her husband and later, on her advice, an additional gear was fixed in the car. Every two years, in a vintage car rally in Germany, the cars drive down the Bertha path to celebrate the first longest journey in an automobile.</p>
<p>In 1892, another German engineer, Rudolf Diesel (1858-1913), patented what came to be known as Diesel engines. The main difference between diesel and gasoline engines is the way the ignition takes place. In a gasoline engine, fuel is mixed with air, compressed and ignited by sparks from spark plugs. In a diesel engine air is taken in and compressed to a high level so that it becomes very hot. Fuel injected at that point self ignites without sparks. This permits the use of inferior grade oil. Diesel engines consume less oil than an equivalent petrol car and have become very common all over the world.</p>
<p>Automobile industry was still in its infancy around the turn of the century, but rapid developments were taking place when two industrialists, Charles Stewart Rolls and Frederick Henry Royce met in the Dining Car of the train to Manchester from London and there the agreement was struck for manufacturing what came to be known as the Rolls-Royce, the most prestigious cars ever to be made. It was on the 4th of May 1904, only 16 years after Benz got his patent for the car that looked like a rickshaw.</p>
<p>The most remarkable development of automobile industry took place in America where Henry Ford ( 1863-1947) founded Ford Motor Company and for the first time introduced what came to be known as “Assembly Line” technology for mass production of motor cars. That was less than a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The number of cars and lorries now add up to almost one billion, using about 3.5 billion litres of petrol and diesel per day. Can we sustain this enormous consumption?</p>

<p><strong>Henry Ford</strong> (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, the founder of the Ford Motor Company, and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production. Although Ford did not invent the automobile, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford to buy. He revolutionized transportation and American industry. As owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with “Fordism “: mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel</strong> (March 18, <span>1858 – September 29, 1913) was a German inventor </span><span>and mechanical engineer, famous for the invention of </span>the Diesel engine. Diesel was born in Paris, France  in 1858 the second of three children of Elise (née Strobel) and Theodor Diesel. His parents were Bavarian immigrants <span>living in Paris. Diesel understood thermodynamics and the </span>theoretical and practical constraints on fuel efficiency. He knew that as much as 90% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted in a steam engine. His work in engine design was driven by the goal of much higher efficiency ratios. Eventually he obtained a patent for his design for a compression-ignition engine. In his engine, fuel was injected at the end of compression and the fuel was ignited by the high temperature resulting from compression.</p>

<p><strong>FLYING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong></p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI: the name evokes sheer awe even five hundred years after the man ceased to live. Da Vinci, the Old master who had, among several other great paintings, created <em>Mona Lisa, </em>the woman with an enigmatic smile, unsurpassed as a piece of art and specially preserved in Louvre, in Paris. Who could think that Da Vinci was a great scientist and a superb craftsman who was among the first to design an Aeroplane? He made 100 sketches, filled a note book with details about how to make it. It is not certain whether Da Vinci actually made an aircraft or he had just left the drawings. That is not very important. What is important is that Italy did not forget to name the International airport of Rome after Da Vinci.</p>
<p>The flight of birds has always evoked man’s urge to fly. Almost every child spreads his hands and runs pretending to take off and fly. Many lives have been lost in man’s attempts to fly, with some kind of improvised wings and jumping from a height.</p>
<p>There were many who believed that “some thing heavier than air cannot fly.” (not counting birds of course).Some religious leaders subscribed to this belief.</p>
<p>In the Ramayanas, however, Ravana is said to have flown in his “Pushpaka Vimana” while abducting Sita. This was of course poetic imagery.</p>
<p>Flying kites was very popular in China as far back as 400 A.D.</p>
<p>Hot air balloons began to be used in Europe with two brothers Joseph (1740-1810) and Jacques Montgolfer (1745-1799) taking lead. The first passengers were a few sheep and goats that were flown a mile at a height of 600 ft. The first manned flight in a balloon took off with the brothers in November 1783.</p>
<p>It was about the same time that gliders were being tried in attempts to fly.</p>
<p>Sir George Cayley (1799-1850) is considered to be the father of aerodynamics. He made gliders.</p>
<p>Count von Ferdinand Zeppelin (1838-1917) of Germany started making airships filled with Hydrogen gas which is much lighter than air. It is a story of relentless efforts and skill and after, several failures, the airships began to fly long distances eventually becoming the first airline connecting the US and Europe. Crossing the Atlantic from Germany to the east coast of the US in two days with 50 passengers dining in luxurious cabins, these airships that were over 300 meters long, 52 meters in diameter cruised gracefully at 125 km per hour across the blue oceans until one morning on May 1937 shortly before docking at Lakehurt, New Jersey, the Airship Hindenburg, burst into flames and in a matter of minutes reduced to ashes killing 35 passengers.</p>
<p>There ended the history of airships, the dream of Count Zeppelin.</p>
<p>The history of people trying to fly, heavier than air, is an endless list. It was realized that by using muscle power a man will not be able to fly as a bird does and power from an engine would be essential. But how does an aeroplane keep afloat against gravitational pull?</p>
<p>Take a thin strip of paper about six inches long and hold it just under your lower lip. The strip bends down under its weight. Begin to blow straight and you will notice the strip of paper lifting up. It remains almost horizontal as long as you keep blowing. This follows <em>Bernoulli’s principle </em>named after Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) the most outstanding mathematician of the family of Dutch-Swiss mathematical geniuses who showed that where a fluid flows at a high velocity the pressure drops. When you blow straight above the paper, the pressure of air above the top surface drops and the pressure of air under the surface being higher, the paper strip is pushed up. The wings of an aeroplane has a special shape called aerofoil. When the plane speeds up, the velocity of air on the upper surface of the wings exceeds the velocity on the lower surface. The air pressure on the top surface, according to Bernoulli’s principle, becomes less than that on the lower surface. This produces an upward force called <em>lift. </em>Which increases approximately proportional to the square of the velocity of the aircraft. When the plane speeds along the runway to the required value, enough <em>lift </em>is produced to counter the downward gravitational pull and the plane takes off. This of course is an approximate account of how a plane flies.</p>
<p>Did the Wright brothers, Wilbur (1867-1912) and Orville (1871-1948) know the details about <em>lift </em>and <em>drag</em> ? (another force that is created on the aerofoil as the plane speeds up). They did. They knew for certain that muscle power would not provide the necessary power to fly and the use of engines was essential. They made meticulous study of all the airplanes and gliders that were tried earlier. Their engineering skill as repairers of cycle helped them a great deal.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers first made a number of gliders and studied their performance and then they made a plane fitted with an engine. On the 17<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> of December at 10.30 a.m. Orville flew for the first time and the flight lasted only 12 seconds, covering 120 ft. On the fourth attempt, it was Wilbur who covered 852 ft in 59 seconds and</p>
<p>Wright brothers made history flying the free controlled, sustained flights in a power driven, heavier- than-air machine.</p>
<p>Aviation has moved a long way from then. Today a Boeing 747 weighing more than 300,000 kg smoothly glides into the air with more than 500 passengers, only with two pilots, computers mostly in control. As you learnt in an earlier section, it will need 65,000 litres of fuel to make a journey of 7200 km. With thousands of aircrafts travelling all over the world all the time, how can we sustain this unavoidable extravagance? Hindenburg disaster had shown that hydrogen is no answer as a fuel unless it is made safe. Researches are on and hydrogen may become the fuel for tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>LIGHTNING AND STATIC CHARGES</strong></p>
<p>Lightning has always terrified men and animals. Lightning flashes on buildings and churches have caused severe damages and deaths and they still do. What causes lightning? It was considered to be divine punishment for the evildoers. Supernatural explanations of natural phenomena are still a common practice.</p>
<p>Interestingly, about 2600 years before now, Thales (624 BC- 546 BC) of Miletus in Ionia (present day Turkey) searched for physical reasons (<em>logos)</em> as different from mythological explanations <em>(mythos)</em> to explain physical phenomena and was one of the seven sages listed by Plato (429 BC-347 BC), the great Greek Philosopher. According to Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), the British Scientist and Philosopher, “Western Science started with Thales.” Thales (THAY-leez) was a great mathematician and took interest in various natural phenomena.</p>
<p>There are references, not fully authenticated though, that Thales knew that Amber (called <em>elektron </em>in Greek) when rubbed with silk develops properties of attracting dry leaves and he also knew of <em>Lodestones</em> (magnetic stones)<em> </em>that have a natural property of attracting certain metals and swing in a certain direction when suspended by a string. Some believe that the stories of electricity and magnetism should begin with Thales.</p>
<p>Not much was known about electricity for centuries until around the middle of the eighteenth century when machines for producing strong static charges began to be made. These were mainly used for amusements and commercial exploitation. An American however startled the world by drawing electricity from the clouds. It was only towards the end of the eighteenth century, that an Italian scientist showed how by chemical means electric charges could be made to flow and produced what is called <em>Current electricity.</em></p>
<p>A serendipitous discovery showed the link between electricity and magnetism and then came the great invention that electricity may be produced by rotating a magnet inside a coil.</p>
<p>And from then on, science has been moving in leaps and bounds. Billions of units of electricity are being produced every instant now, to drive industries, light up dark nights, cool and heat the air as required, helping to run computers and sending signals round the earth in milliseconds.</p>
<p>In the next few sections we shall discuss the very exciting stories of these discoveries, the lives of the inventors and also get to know how billions of tons of fossil fuels are being burnt to produce electricity, the life blood of modern civilization. Most of the technologies for alternative energy are geared towards the production of electricity, the cleanest and the most versatile form of energy that exists. Let us revert to static charges.</p>
<p>You must have all tried rubbing a comb with silk and holding it close to small pieces of paper and seen how the pieces cling to the comb. We shall discuss the details of the structure of an atom later but suffice it to say now that atoms are electrically neutral. If negatively charged electrons of an atom are removed, there would be an excess of positively charged protons in the nucleus and the atom would become positively charged. On rubbing, the comb loses some electrons and becomes positively charged. Holding the comb near pieces of paper, the electrons from the atoms of the paper close to the comb are attracted to the positively charged comb. The pieces of paper being very light are lifted towards the comb since positive charges attract negative charges.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, interest in making machines for generating strong static charges began in the early eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) who was fascinated by scientific experiments, would pull out an electrical machine from his desk and charge himself up, ‘so that the fierce crackling sparks flew forth; and his long wild locks bristled and stood on end.’</p>
<p>In clubs, unsuspecting guests would be shocked by cutleries that would be charged; candles would be relit and alcohol set to flame using electric sparks. Apart from these practices some physicians claimed that electric charges could cure various physical and mental disorders.</p>
<p>It was around this time that a man, (one of the seventeen children of a person of modest means), who had to stop going to school at the age of ten because his father could not pay his school fees, grew up working in his brother’s printing shop. His genius and perseverance made him one of the greatest polymaths, a scientist, inventor, administrator, diplomat and a humanist, all in one. He was Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) described as “the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.”</p>
<p>He took his science seriously. He wanted to understand what causes lightning and thought of an ingenious experiment that could have, in a flash, terminated this extraordinary life. On a rainy day when lightning flashed across the sky, he sent a silk kite into the dark clouds. A key connected to the silk thread got charged confirming the idea that lightning is caused by the build up of electricity in clouds. (Charges are formed by friction of air and water droplets and ice particles. A lightning strike carries more than 10,000 ampere of currents at hundred million volts.)</p>
<p>Franklin always believed in finding a use for his science. He had made a cheap heater called “Franklin Stove” cheap enough for the poor to afford. Franklin invented a device that would prevent lightning strikes. He had observed that tall buildings such as churches were particularly vulnerable to lightning strikes. He fixed rods with spikes mounted on top of tall buildings and churches and connected these through thick copper wires mounted outside the buildings and grounded them. Electric charges accumulating on the spike would attract the lightning current which would flow to the ground, sparing the buildings. Lightning rods as they are called, saved thousands of lives. They also helped to dispel the belief that God uses Lightning to punish the evildoers.</p>

<p><strong>CURRENT ELECTRICITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luigi Galvani</strong></p>
<p>Good Universities usually act as incubators where talents are hatched. There are many examples but in the present context let us focus on two,</p>
<p>1) The University of Bologna (Italy)—It is the oldest <em>continually functioning </em>University in the World established around the year 1088. Among a large number of very distinguished alumni was LUIGI GALVANI. (1737-1798); 2)The University of Pavia (Italy) estd. 1361…among several distinguished alumni features ALESSANDRO VOLTA (1745-1827), Professor, Pavia Chair of natural sciences (1769-1804).</p>
<p>Let us begin with Galvani. A shy, quiet but a brilliant man of great integrity, he wanted to join the church. But his father being a medical man may have prevailed on him to go for medicine. Galvani excelled as an anatomist and was offered a faculty position in the University of Bologna. He became the Director when he was barely 42 years old. His wife Lucia Galleazzi, joined Galvani as his assistant.</p>
<p>As the story goes, Galvani had been working with frogs for many years. He was keen to observe the effects of static charges on frogs’ muscles. One day he accidentally touched a sciatic nerve of a frog fixed to a metal tray with steel knife and the frog violently kicked as if it were alive. Galvani was perplexed and excited to see this.</p>
<p>There were discussions then going on in Europe as to how our body catches signals from the brain. For example how does the hand lifting a cup from a table receive the signal from the brain to do so? Galvani on noticing how frog’s muscle twitched announced that it was <em>animal electricity </em>present in the nerves that conveyed these signals to control muscular movements. Being a meticulous scientist, he carried out extensive tests and made careful notes. Finally he published a book but for some reason did not print more than twelve copies, one of which he forwarded to Alessandro Volta.</p>
<p>Galvani and Volta were of opposite nature. Volta was flamboyant and adept in self-promotion which Galvani abhorred. Soon after receiving the book from Galvani, Volta opened a tirade of criticism of Galvani’s work. As it turned out, Volta was correct and Galvani was wrong in interpreting the experiments he had reported.</p>
<p>Volta concluded that electricity is not inherent in the muscles. There is nothing like <em>animal electricity </em>as Galvani claimed but chemicals or muscles placed between <em>different metals cause electricity to be </em><em>produced.</em></p>
<p>Very few have heard of Johann Sulzer, a professor of mathematics who, somewhere around the year 1750, sandwiched his tongue between two pieces of metal, one of zinc and the other of copper and noticed a pungent taste and had a tingling sensation. That was precisely Volta’s finding. Two different metals with a chemical (or a biochemical) make charges to flow from one metal (anode) to the other (cathode), through an acid or flesh. Sulzer did not pursue what he observed and missed the opportunity of earning immortality. This often happens in science.</p>
<p>Galvani’s explanation was wrong but who would deny it today that electric signals from neurons do pass through the nerves and give us sensation and help us to control our muscles?. But these electric pulses are caused very differently.</p>
<p>Alessandro Volta lost no time in widely publicizing his findings after he made what came to be known as <em>“Volta’s pile”</em>. Volta showed how he could, by chemical means, produce electricity. In his pile he kept small discs of zinc and copper stacked alternately, separated by cloth soaked in acid and sparks could be produced by connecting one end of the pile to the other end through a conductor and even current made to flow. That was the first battery (1800)</p>
<p>It did not escape Volta’s attention that his pile produced what is now called <em>current electricity, </em>for, he wrote: “<em>This endless circulation of the electric fluid (this </em><em>perpetual motion) may appear paradoxical and even inexplicable, but it is no less </em><em>true and real; and you may feel it, as I may say, with your hands.”</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, the flow of charges which constitutes <em>electric current </em>was termed e<em>lectric fluid. </em>(it is not <em>perpetual motion </em>as conceived by Volta. It decays due to resistance of a circuit unless there is a voltage or pressure provided by a battery to sustain it.)</p>
<p>What then is the difference between static charges and electric current? We shall offer a simple analogy. Think of a water tank placed at a height. If the tank bursts all the water will fall to the ground at once. This is like static charges stored in the clouds and in a lightning - burst the charges flow to the ground. On the other hand, if we have a pool of water from which water is pumped out, made to flow in pipes and allowed to flow back to the pool it is like current electricity. The pump is analogous to the battery.</p>
<p>We started this chapter with the stories of Galvani and Volta and their inventions. Let us end with their stories. You must have heard of Napoleon Bonaparte.(1769-1821) Like several other European countries Italy was invaded and occupied by Napoleon. Luigi Galvani refused to owe allegiance to Napoleon’s rule and was sacked from his University position. Galvani was without any job and any income. His wife passed away in the year 1790. Galvani was heart broken. He died in 1798 in abject poverty. Volta lost no time in owing allegiance to Napoleon and became his favourite and was showered with grants and was made a count.</p>
<p>When we describe electrical pressure we use the unit of Volts named after Volta. Galvani had galvanized the world of science and Galvanometer is named after him.</p>

<p><strong>CURRENT ELECTRICITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND THE SCIENTIFIC</strong></p>
<p><strong>REVOLUTION IT USHERED IN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Humphry Davy</strong></p>
<p>It seems amazing when we think that between the year 1800 and 2000, exactly within 200 years, the dramatic changes that have taken place in every sphere of human life when, previously, centuries passed and hardly any changes took place. The single discovery this dramatic changes may be attributed to was that of <em>Current Electricity.</em></p>
<p>It was, without a doubt, Volta’s pile that triggered off this scientific revolution. The first outcome was <em>Electrochemistry</em> and discovery of many elements. This was followed by <em>Electromagnetism </em>and <em>Electromagnetic Power generation and Drives. </em>Once electricity became widely available <em>Industrial Drives, Communication and </em><em>Computers which are all driven by electric current </em>developed and changed the world beyond recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Electrochemistry:</strong></p>
<p>As soon as current electricity became available a new method of chemical analysis was ushered in. As a result, a number of elements that were known about but existed as chemical compounds were isolated, one by one, with unimaginable impact. Chemistry changed and our lives changed with it. Prior to the introduction of <em>Electrolysis</em> i.e. chemical decomposition by action of current, complex chemical methods were used to isolate various elements. Let us begin with hydrogen which is one of the most important of all elements.</p>
<p>It was Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) who is credited as the discoverer of hydrogen, the first element on the periodic table. He observed that hydrogen was a highly flammable gas and on burning produced water. You may remember the disaster of Hindenburg when the hydrogen inside the Zeppelin burst into flames.</p>
<p>Cavendish came from a highly aristocratic family of dukes and duchesses. Being a pathologically shy person he kept almost completely to himself. But he was designated to be the “richest of all the learned and the most learned of all the rich.”</p>
<p>The famous Laboratory in Cambridge where Cavendish studied was named after him.</p>
<p>Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) was a great experimental scientist who is said to have named hydrogen from the Greek words hydro (water) and gene (generator) which showed Lavoisier was aware that hydrogen could be derived from water. During the French Revolution he was guillotined and the great mathematician Lagrange said in bitter comment, “It took but a moment to cut off the head. It will take a century to grow another like it.”</p>
<p>The English scientist Joseph Priestly(1733-1804), the discoverer of oxygen also deserves credit for producing water by burning hydrogen. Hydrogen was a landmark discovery before electrolysis started and Cavendish, Lavoisier and Priestly were the pioneering scientists during the late eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Soon after Volta’s pile was announced by Volta, W. Nicholson and Prof. Anthony Carlisle carried out an experiment of passing electric current through water and found gas bubbles coming out of the two electrodes. One was hydrogen and the other oxygen.</p>
<p><em>How does a Galvanic Cell or a Voltaic Cell Work</em>
<em>?</em></p>
<p>A combination of two metals (the electrodes) in an aqueous solution for producing electrical energy from chemical energy is sometimes called a Galvanic cell. One such cell may be called a Voltaic cell. A battery is an assembly of such cells.</p>
<p>Let us have a glass jar and fill it with dilute sulphuric acid (H<span><sub>2</sub></span>SO<span><sub>4</sub></span>) (the Electrolyte) and insert a zinc rod and a copper rod inside. Zinc dissolves in the acid and zinc sulphate (ZnSO<span><sub>4</sub></span>) is formed. Hydrogen with positive charge is released from the reaction and (2H+) drifts towards the copper rod which gets positively charged. The zinc rod gets negatively charged. If the two electrodes are connected externally, electrons from the zinc rod flow to the copper rod through the external circuit. The electrolyte conducts current which completes the electric circuit. Hydrogen atoms keep drifting to the copper rod and (SO<span><sub>4</sub></span><span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">- -<\/a><\/sup></span>) to the zinc rod and the current continues to flow. (Not really. In this case a film of hydrogen soon forms around the copper rod and the flow of current slowly decreases.)</p>
<p>The pioneer in Electrochemistry turned out to be a wood carver’s son, brilliant, precocious, dynamic and ambitious. It was Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829).</p>
<p>He was born and brought up in Penzance in Cornwall, England. Davy’s education was not planned. To quote Davy, “I consider it fortunate. I was left much to myself as a child and put upon no particular plan of study. What I am I made myself.”</p>
<p>Davy was a poet of no mean caliber. To quote the famous poet Coleridge, “If he had not been the first chemist he would have been the first poet of his age.”</p>
<p>But Davy chose science and excelled in it.</p>
<p>Davy joined the Pneumatic Institute in Bristol where “medical powers of various air and gases had to be tested. Davy tried a number of these on himself and was almost killed trying to inhale too much of nitrous oxide ( laughing gas) which was later found to be a suitable gas for anaesthesia. Davy received an offer of Asst. lectureship at the Royal Institution and joined it and eventually became its Director. Davy isolated several alkali elements. The first was potassium by sending electricity through caustic potash (KOH) and the same year (1807) he isolated sodium. He isolated several other elements like calcium, barium and boron. Davy appointed a young book binder as an assistant for washing test tubes and other appliances. He was Michael Faraday. Faraday accompanied Davy as his valet to the Continent and together they discovered iodine while in France. Faraday made major contributions to Electrochemistry but is remembered more for generating electricity, a fascinating story that we shall tell you very soon.</p>
<p>Humphry Davy died in 1829 in Geneva where one can visit his grave.</p>

<p><em>Current electricity and the scientific revolution it ushered in</em></p>
<p><strong>ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Christian Oersted</strong></p>
<p>When we discussed Magnetism and Electricity in earlier chapters, we treated them separately as though they are totally different entities and so was the thinking until almost 200 years before now. It was known that static charges attract or repel static charges, magnets also attract or repel magnets, but static charges do not attract magnets and magnets do not attract bodies that are electrically charged until one day on 21 April 1820, a Danish Professor called Hans Christian Oersted noticed the deflections of a compass needle close to a conductor through which electrical current from a Volta’s battery was switched on or off. Does the current flowing through a conductor behave as a magnet? Is there a link between electricity and magnetism?</p>
<p>While travelling around Europe on a travel scholarship that he had won, he came to know a number of scholars who believed in symmetry in Nature and suspected that a close link between electricity and magnetism may exist and Oersted for the first time, came upon its evidence by sheer accident. Having a trained mind he did not overlook this evidence.</p>
<p>Hans Christian Oersted was born in Denmark on 14 August 1777. His father was an apothecary and Oersted learnt a lot about drugs and their application, and he developed his interest in science from there. He and his brother Anders received most of their early education through self-study and when both brothers joined the University of Copenhagen, both of them excelled academically. Hans Christian earned his doctorate in 1799 in Metaphysics at the age of twenty two and during his travel round Europe, he developed interest in Physics. Oersted became a Professor at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Oersted did not immediately publish his observation of the effect of voltaic current on magnet. He wanted to observe things more closely.</p>
<p>After three months of extensive experiments he realized that magnetism is symmetrically distributed around the conductor rather than being radiated as heat or light are radiated.</p>
<p>Oersted’s publication of his studies in the month of September 1820 was immediately picked up by Andre-Marie Ampere who carried out a mathematical analysis of electromagnetism and within seven days, submitted his comprehensive paper on it.</p>
<p>You must be familiar with the unit of current. It is Ampere. We learnt earlier that the unit of voltage is volt, after Alessandro Volta.</p>
<p>VoltageCurrent = Power.</p>
<p>The unit of power is watt after James Watt.</p>
<p>If you have a 100 watt lamp and apply 250 volts to it, the lamp will emit 100 watts of power while drawing 100/250 = 0.4 ampere of current.</p>
<p>Current in ampere = Charge in coulombs/ time in seconds.</p>
<p>Coulomb is the unit of electrical charge. Each electron carries a charge of minus 1.6(10)<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">-19 <\/a><\/sup></span>coulomb. You can easily calculate how many trillion electrons will flow in 0.4 ampere of current in one second.</p>
<p>Ampere was born near Lyon in France on 20 January 1775. He was a child prodigy. His father taught him Latin and helped his learning of mathematics, history, philosophy and natural sciences. Ampere had a phenomenal memory and the ability to grasp mathematics. By the time he was eighteen years old, he is said to have learnt all the mathematics that was known till then.</p>
<p>When Ampere was barely fourteen years old the French Revolution (1789-1799) broke out. The fortress of Bastille where arms were stored fell on the 14th of July, 1789. French revolution was a revolt against the monarchy, aristocracy and Church.The king Louis the 16th, the queen and many members of the aristocracy were executed. Some of the liberals who led the revolution became autocrats and many innocent and talented individuals were sent to the guillotine. In the previous chapter you learnt about Lavoisier, who was guillotined.</p>
<p>Ampere’s father felt that he would be safe with his family at Lyon while the revolution raged in other parts of France. Lyon was soon taken over and Ampere’s father was appointed the <em>Justice of Peace. </em>He was later arrested for what the revolutionaries considered was a wrong judgement by him and Ampere’s father was guillotined in 1793. This was such a shock for Ampere that he went into depression and stopped his studies.</p>
<p>Ampere recovered from it after about a year and continued with his pursuit of mathematics. Ampere gained great proficiency in mathematics and physics and gave private tuition. He married a woman called Julie whom he loved dearly, but she was somewhat cold towards him. In 1801 Ampere left his infant son and ailing wife for Bourg where he had received an offer of Professorship. His wife died when he was away and Ampere never forgave himself for the death of his young wife.</p>
<p>In 1804, Ampere got a professorship at the University of Lyon and moved back to Lyon and published a number of papers in mathematics. His seminal work on electromagnetism was published, as stated earlier, only seven days after Oersted’s paper appeared. In fact Ampere’s work was far more comprehensive than Oersted’s and placed the theory of electromagnetism and electrodynamics on a firm footing. Ampere demonstrated to the Academy of Lyon, how voltaic currents flowing through two parallel wires placed close to each other influence each other. If the voltaic currents flow in the same direction the wires attract each other and if the voltaic currents are in opposite direction, they repel each other.</p>
<p>So the journey had begun and it was for Michael Faraday, an assistant of Humphry Davy, to step in and in a few long strides take electromagnetic Induction and electrodynamics to a stage when by rotating an electromagnet one could produce electricity.</p>
<p>We still do so and typically rotate an enormous electromagnet 3000 times in a minute and produce 500 megawatts of electricity enough to light up 5 million 100 watt lamps.</p>

<p><strong>THE BOOKBINDER WHO</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHANGED THE WORLD</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Faraday</strong></p>
<p>It was a cold evening in London in the year of 1813. A carriage from the Royal Institution stopped in front of a book binder’s shop. Gas lights on the cobbled roads had been turned on. The candles in the bookbinder’s shop had been turned off except for the one in the attic where Michael sat with a book that he had just finished binding when he heard an impatient knock on the door downstairs. Michael ran down and opened the door and was handed over a letter with the emblem of the Royal Institution.</p>
<p>The letter was from Professor Humphry Davy, asking Michael to meet him.</p>
<p>Some time earlier, Michael had received free tickets to attend the lectures of Humphry Davy and had taken careful notes. At the end of the lectures, he copied and bound three hundred pages of the notes and presented the volume to Humphry Davy requesting him for a job. Davy had nothing to offer immediately but at the first opportunity appointed him as a Chemical assistant.</p>
<p>Michael Farady (1791-1867) was born in Surrey to a very poor family. He sold newspapers when he was very young. His father could afford only three months of school education for him. Michael was very keen on learning and when he got an apprenticeship at George Ribeau’s shop for book binding and selling, he used every spare moment to read, particularly books on science.</p>
<p>Although Michael had joined as a chemical assistant required to wash beakers and test tubes and keep the laboratory clean, he was soon found to be highly capable and motivated. Davy took him along in his continental tour as a valet since Davy’s actual valet was unable to come. Unfortunately, Davy’s wife Jane Apreece who was very conscious of her aristocratic status, ill treated Michael since he was a commoner. Michael however greatly impressed the scientists whom he met during the Continental trip.</p>
<p>As has been discussed in an earlier chapter, Davy was one of the pioneers in <em>Electrochemistry</em>. Michael quickly picked up the trick of the trade and he made major contributions to this field. A number of laws in Electrochemistry carry his name. He discovered benzene and several compounds of chlorine and invented the first version of the Bunsen burner.</p>
<p>Faraday was greatly interested in electricity and made his own Volta’s pile for carrying out experiments. It was around 1821 that Oersted’s and Ampere’s work were getting to be known widely. It is said that Professors W.H. Wollaston and Humphry Davy were one day discussing how to make an electric motor when Michael happened to be present. Michael instinctively realized that Wollaston and Davy, were going along the wrong track in their plans to achieve electromagnetic rotation. He designed and made a device where, for the first time, electromagnetic rotational motion was achieved. That was the precursor to today’s electric motor. When he published his work, Michael was accused of plagiarism by his mentor Humphry Davy and Michael, upset that he was so accused, stopped publishing his work on electromagnetism as long as Davy was alive (1830).</p>
<p>It was Faraday who first observed that if there are two coils, one connected to a Volta’s pile and the other closed through a meter to record a current (ammeter) were placed close by facing each other, switching on current in the first one caused a momentary current to flow in the second coil. This phenomenon is called <em>INDUCTION</em>. Transformers which are very commonly used for stepping up or stepping down voltages and currents are based on the principle of <em>Induction</em> or more precisely<em> Mutual Induction.</em></p>
<p>Faraday also observed that a coil whose terminals are connected through an ammeter shows a momentary current if a magnet is moved in to or out of the coil. Faraday hypothesized that a magnet (or an electromagnet) produces a <em>MAGNETIC </em><em>FIELD</em> and when a coil is moved through this field a voltage is <em>induced in the coil </em><em>which causes a current to flow if the coil is closed.</em></p>
<p>From these observations it may be summarized that:</p>
<p><em>A </em>
<strong>Magnet </strong>
<em>in </em>
<strong>Motion</strong>

<strong>Electricity</strong>
<em>…..</em>
<strong>Generator</strong></p>
<p><em>A </em>
<strong>Magnet</strong>
<em> and </em>
<strong>Electricity</strong>
<em> produce </em>
<strong>Motion</strong>
<em>……….</em>
<strong>Motor.</strong></p>
<p>Faraday’s classic paper published in the year 1835 paved the way to making Electric Motors and Electric Generators. Faraday did not express his findings in terms of equations but it was James Clerk Maxwell whom we have discussed earlier, put Faraday’s experimental findings in the form of an elegant equation which goes by the name of <em>FARADAY’S LAW.</em></p>
<p>It was discussed in the last chapter that a typical generator of today may produce hundreds of millions of watts of power based on Faraday’s findings. Transformers help in transmitting electricity across hundreds of kilometers at times at 400,000 volts or even above.</p>
<p>Michael Faraday, described as the best experimental scientist in the entire history of Science, received many awards. He turned down Knighthood because he did not want to dissociate himself from the humble background that he came from. He refused to work for the British Government to develop war weapons during the Crimean war (1853-1856) on ethical grounds. He believed in bringing science close to the public and introduced what came to be known as the <em>FARADAY LECTURES</em>.</p>
<p>Faraday is said to have denied consent to be buried in the Westminster Abbey, reserved for the Royalty and men of great eminence (Newton was buried there) and a very humble memorial stone shared with his loving wife Sarah Faraday (1800-1879) who described herself as the “pillow for his mind”, adorns the Highgate Cemetery in London.</p>

<p><strong>ONE OF THE GREATEST</strong></p>
<p><strong>INVENTORS WHO SOLD CANDIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thomas Alva Edison</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). One of the greatest inventors who had 1036 patents to his credit, invented the Incandescent lamps that are still in use, the kinetoscope (Cinematography), phonograph (Gramophone) and the technology of power distribution.</p>
<p>He helped in several ways to usher in modern civilization. His formal education in Milan, Ohio, USA, ended in three months when he overheard one of his teachers refer to him as ‘addled’ (muddled, confused) because he did not pay attention in the classes. He was taught at home by his mother. He used to sell candies and newspapers in trains. Edison was appointed a telegraph operator in a railway station as a reward for saving the stationmaster’s little child from being run over by a train. This is where, as an operator Edison learnt about electricity, about batteries, about magnets and above all the art of telegraphy. While working as a night operator he made several inventions for improving telegraphy. He could not, however, retain his job at the station too long. During his experiments he spilled acid which flowed through the wooden floor to the stationmaster’s table downstairs.</p>
<p>Edison patented some of his inventions and made a lot of money selling them.</p>
<p>Eventually, Edison set up his industries and business. He is known to have said that “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration.” His tenacity was unbelievable. He used to say: “If I find 10,000 ways of something that won’t work, I haven’t failed. I am not discouraged because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.”</p>
<p>Let us go into the story of incandescent lamps which brought great fame and money to Edison. After the invention of Volta’s pile, scientists from various parts of the world tried to produce light using electricity. It was Professor Joseph Swan who came very close to making the incandescent lamp that we know today. He had realized that the filament to be used for making a lamp had to be inserted inside a glass bulb which should be evacuated. The evacuation of the bulbs is necessary to remove oxygen to prevent burning out of the hot filament.</p>
<p>Edison possibly took the Swan lamp and started trying out all kinds of materials like carbon made out of different types of fibres to make the filament.</p>
<p>It needs to be remembered that the power P emitted by a bulb is given by P=VI and V=RI and hence P=I<span><sup>2</Sup></span>R =V<span><Sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">2<\/a><\/sup></span>/R, where I is current,V is the voltage applied and R the resistance of the filament. Obviously, for the same voltage, low resistance gives larger power and high resistance gives low power.</p>
<p>Resistance is high if the filament is long and thin. It is low if the filament is short and thick. Low voltage draws less current for the same resistance. Edison found that the best option would be to keep voltage low (110 volts) and use short and thick filaments to get a reasonable amount of Power. <em>Thick and short filaments would be less fragile </em>and low voltage needs less robust insulation for cables. Perhaps this is how 110 volts became the standard voltage in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Edison and his team kept trying endlessly. Then one day the lamp could be lighted and it continued to burn. Edison and his team looked on and the experience is best described in Edison’s own words.</p>
<p>“The day was –let me see—October 21, 1879. We sat and looked, and the lamp continued to burn, and the longer it burnt, the more fascinated we were. None of us could go to bed. There was no sleep for us for forty hours. We sat and just watched it with anxiety going into elation. It lasted about forty hours”.</p>
<p>Edison knew that something spectacular needed to be made to catch public attention. So he got thousands of lamps made. Made generators large enough to feed thousands of lamps and decorated the road leading to his house at Menlo Park. Hordes of people poured in to see the “magic” to be shown by the “Wizard of Menlo Park” and as darkness fell, thousands of lights were switched on, making the night as bright as the day.</p>
<p>Initially, the Ediswan company was floated and when Edison was granted a patent in the year 1880, he continued to make thousands of electric bulbs.</p>
<p>Trillions of bulbs must have been made and have burnt out over the one hundred and thirty years incandescent bulbs have been in operation.</p>
<p>Incandescent lamps are inefficient since they produce more heat than light. With filaments made of Tungsten the present incandescent lamps last reasonably long. These are, however, being slowly replaced. We shall discuss this in another chapter. Saving energy is an alternative source of energy.</p>
<p>Edison’s phonograph revolutionized the world in a different way. No body could imagine that a sound could be stored. Edison did exactly that by making a needle vibrate in response to a sound, etch the vibration on wax and run the needle back along the track and reproduce the sound. Cylinders made of paste boards with wax deposited on them were used for etching the vibrations and horns used for amplifying the sound from the vibrations. Sound recording and reproduction have moved miles away from the day when Edison had recorded, “Mary had a little lamb…” on his phonograph.</p>
<p>Kinetography was also Edison’s invention. You may know that if you take one second to lift a cup to your lip, and say 12 shots are taken of this action and projected back, the viewer will not see jerky motion but a continuous movement of the hand because of persistence of vision. Based on this principle, Cinematography was introduced by Edison. This technology has moved thousands of miles.</p>
<p>And so has the Edison General Electric Company, set up by Edison which is now the famous General Electric Company.</p>

<p><em>One of the greatest inventors who sold candies</em></p>
<p><strong>“PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong></p>
<p>The cleaners of the hotel kept seeing the “Please do not disturb” notice and did not enter the room for a couple of days until the matron decided to walk in, only to find the body of the tall 86 year old occupant who lived alone.</p>
<p>So had died the man who changed your life and mine. He could have been as rich as Bill Gates but died bankrupt. Today his elegant statue near the Niagara falls in New York draws hordes of travelers. He was Nikola Tesla (1856-1943).</p>
<p>Tesla was born in Serbia, once a part of Yugoslavia. His father was a pastor. It was his father’s wish that Nikola should join the Church. Nikola wanted to become an engineer. Nikola fell seriously ill a number of times in his early life and once, when he was almost unconscious, his father is said to have shouted into Nikola’s ears,</p>
<p>“Nikola, you get better. I shall make you an engineer.” Nikola recovered and became one of the greatest engineers the world has ever had. To Tesla we owe many essentials of life operated by electricity and electricity itself.</p>
<p>Look up and you will see your ceiling fan quietly running for hours. Switch on the electric motor, or the refrigerator or almost any appliance. They are mostly made with <em>INDUCTION MOTORS.</em> It was one of many inventions of Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Faraday was the first one to show how the motion of a magnet produced electricity and electricity combined with magnet produced rotary motion. Other engineers used his principle and commercialized the production of electricity. Edison was one of them and he showed how to produce light with electricity. Tesla showed how you can send electricity to long distances and run motors efficiently.</p>
<p>When Tesla was in college studying engineering, crude versions of motors operated by Direct Current (DC) were in the market. Tesla did not like these machines which kept sparking and were inefficient. He kept thinking whether Alternating currents (AC) could be used for making better motors. As the story goes, Tesla was once convalescing from a serious illness and his friend took him to a park to watch the sunset. As he saw the sun go down, Tesla was overtaken by emotion and began to recite from Goethe’s <em>Faust</em></p>
<p>“ <em>The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;</em></p>
<p><em> It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,</em></p>
<p><em> Upon its track to follow, follow soaring” </em></p>
<p>And suddenly it came to him in a flash, the idea of a rotating magnetic field and an induction motor.</p>
<p>After graduation Tesla took a job in a company of Edison in Paris. After some years he wanted to leave for the US, then the “New World” He was carrying a letter of introduction to Edison from a close associate of the latter. When Tesla met Edison he handed over the letter which read: “I have met two great men in my life. One is you and the other is the bearer of the letter.” Edison appointed Tesla for $18 a week and is said to have told Tesla, to design and make some special motors. “There is $50,000 for you if you can make it.”</p>
<p>Tesla worked night and day, handed over the machines to Edison and claimed the promised sum. Edison laughed it off as an American joke he had made and refused to pay. Tesla was shocked and left Edison. For quite some time Tesla worked as a trench digger until one day his boss spotted his talents and together they started a company.</p>
<p>Ideas came to him in flashes as Tesla described in his autobiography. And most of these ideas bore fruit. It is not widely known that Tesla was one of the first persons to send wireless signals. Marconi got the 1909Nobel prize for radio. Both Jagadishchandra Bose and Nikola Tesla had preceded Marconi. Bose did not patent his invention, Tesla did. Marconi infringed Tesla’s patents and used Bose’s coherer for the “Receiver”. There were endless litigations between Tesla and Marconi. Marconi lost at first but somehow he got the judgment turned into his favour; but in 1943, the Supreme Court of the US announced, rather too late, that the credit should have gone to Tesla and not Marconi. Marconi had outstanding skills for publicity, Bose did not want any publicity and Tesla was busy in his inventions and did not have the support of the upper echelons of the society which Marconi had and used to the maximum extent.</p>
<p>Tesla never married and spent his entire life in hotels. He used to feed pigeons and he loved a particular white pigeon. Tesla was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda and the philosophy of <em>Vedanta.</em></p>
<p>Tesla’s major contribution to humanity was Alternating currents in preference to Direct currents as we shall discuss in the next chapter since it is essential to understand their difference in the context of Alternative sources of Energy.</p>
<p>Tesla gave up his royalties for AC machines that Westinghouse had bought from Tesla so that AC could win and help science and society. Sadly, he had to declare bankruptcy in 1916.</p>
<p>When Tesla was in failing health, he remembered one day that he owed some money to two secretaries who used to type for him, Tesla asked them to search his drawer and take the money out of there. Only a few dollars were found and Tesla asked them to take instead a heavy gold medal that he had received. The girls refused to take it and left.</p>
<p>One evening, when it was snowing outside, his white pigeon came, fluttered her wings as if to tell Tesla she was dying. Tesla was soon to follow.</p>
<p><em>Please do not disturb</em></p>
<p><strong>THE WAR OF CURRENTS</strong></p>
<p>As we stood on the deck of a launch, covered in blue plastic overalls and approached the falls, its thunderous noise grew louder and despite water spraying all over us we could see the Niagara Falls, in its fullest splendour. A mist hung on it but we could see the enormous amount of water rolling down to great depths. What a huge amount of potential energy must be there getting converted into kinetic energy and then into electrical energy!” I thought.</p>
<p>The same thought must have motivated a number of engineers and industrialists almost 120 years ago when hydroelectric generators had become a reality. The sordid tale of the “ War of currents” crowded into my mind. DC or AC? General Electric or Westinghouse? Edison or Tesla?</p>
<p>When Alessandro Volta created history in 1800, after his invention of Volta’s pile it was Direct Current or DC (unidirectional current) that was first made to flow. From chemically produced electric current, to electromagnetically produced electricity was yet another epoch making invention by Faraday in 1831.</p>
<p>Edison lighted up the Menlo Park, having developed parallel circuits, drawing two cables out from a generator, and connecting two ends of a bulb to different points along the two wires and that was how houses within a couple of kilometers from the generator were easily electrified by drawing two cables. Electrification, mainly of affluent homes, was being carried out from DC generators driven by oil.</p>
<p>Water falls presented a great source of power to turn turbines to rotate the rotors of generators for producing electricity.</p>
<p>The first hydroelectric station is believed to have been set up in Austria in 1860.</p>
<p>The first Hydel generator in India was installed in Darjeeling in 1897 and the second was in Shimshapura near Mysore in 1902 (it is still in operation).</p>
<p>The Niagara falls presented a huge source for hydroelectric power and different companies were bidding for the rights. The main contenders were General Electric of Thomas Edison and Westinghouse Company of Westinghouse. Edison wanted to produce DC mainly to protect the revenue he earned from his DC patents. Besides, he knew very little about AC systems. About Tesla’s AC system. Edison said, “Tesla’s ideas are splendid but are utterly impractical.”</p>
<p>The electricity harnessed from the Niagara was too large to be used locally or within a few kilometers. But even 1000 kilowatts of power produced at 500 volts, needed the transportation of 2000 amperes of Direct currents( for DC, I = P/V) to supply industries at Buffalo, at a distance of say 30km.This called for very thick copper conductors which are very heavy and extremely costly<em>.</em><strong> Voltage and current cannot be stepped up or down with</strong> <strong>DC but can be easily done in an AC system using TRANSFORMERS. </strong>500 volts of AC voltage stepped up, say twenty times, using a transformer to 10,000 volts, reduces the current to a little more than 100 amperes and easily transported.</p>
<p>What is the difference between DC and AC? Look at a simple cell used in a torch light. There is a protruding end and the other is flat. The protruding end is always Positive and the flat side is always negative, and electrons will always flow from the Cathode(-) to the Anode(+) and the current remains almost constant. Now look at the two holes in the socket in your room.(usually there are three holes, the larger at the top is for earthing.) The two lower holes keep changing their polarity. The current will <strong>not </strong>flow in the same direction as in DC but keep alternating 50 times in a second. In India and Europe the frequency is 50c/s or 50 Hz. In USA and Canada, 60Hz is used.</p>
<p>Westinghouse realized that AC would be the only answer and Tesla had the right design for the<em> </em><strong>Generation, Transmission and Utilization in an AC system. </strong>Tesla’s Induction Motor was the perfect machine for Industrial Drives. It may be relevant to mention in this context that an AC system may be divided into two phases or three phases. In a three phase system a generator has three sets of coils into which three voltages separated by 120 degrees are produced. Three phases fed to a motor produce a rotating magnetic field which makes the rotor rotate. That is the basic principle of an Induction motor. For small domestic motors single phase is split into two to produce the rotating magnetic field. In its simplest form generated voltage from an AC generator is stepped up using a transformer. If the voltage is ‘stepped up’, the current is ‘stepped down’. Low current is transmitted across a long distance, the voltage is then stepped down in stages and finally a single phase is fed for domestic use and three phase for Industrial or agricultural use.</p>
<p>Edison realized that his DC system had no case. He started a massive anti AC campaign.</p>
<p>He wanted to show that an AC system was lethal. He coined the word “Westinghoused” to mean “Electrocuted”. People started losing their pets which were later found electrocuted. The meanest effort was to make secret payments and have AC used for an Electric chair prevalent in those days for Capital punishment. The first man to be executed in New York, did not die immediately since the executor was unused to AC. The condemned man suffered so much that newspaper reporters were aghast to see this brutality.</p>
<p>Despite all these campaigns, fortunately for humanity, AC won. Had DC won the day, electrification would have been much more slow, inefficient and limited.</p>
<p>Tesla gave up his royalty to enable Westinghouse to introduce AC system and as we know died alone in abject poverty.</p>
<p>When J.C. Bose was asked as to who invented the radio, Bose said, “An invention is more important than the inventor.” and as we know Marconi got the Nobel prize along with C.F. Braun. Bose and Tesla were not even mentioned.</p>
<p>True, but it does not seem fair that Edison’s last breath was collected in a test tube and preserved in a museum while no one knew when Tesla breathed his last.</p>
<p><em>The war of currents</em></p>
<p><strong>George Westinghouse</strong></p>
<p><strong>SIR MV AND THE HYDEL</strong></p>
<p><strong>STORY OF KARNATAKA</strong></p>
<p>Let us leave the Niagara behind for now and come home to India to Karnataka.</p>
<p>Rising out of Talakaveri, Kaveri flows down the Deccan plateau towards South east on her way to Tamilnadu, finally to merge with the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>After her emergence from Talakaveri, she flows quietly past Srirangapatna.</p>
<p>Soon the tributary Shimsha river joins her and Kaveri changes from a slender rivulet into a mighty river and at Shivasamudram, Gaganachukki and Bharachukki falls drop 320 feet in gorgeous splendour. So has it been for centuries.</p>
<p>A little over hundred years before now some engineers had other ideas than just to watch the beauty of Kaveri.</p>
<p>The Kolar gold mine was to be exploited to the fullest extent and a township was growing there. The use of Kolar gold goes back to antiquity. It has been traced to Mahenjodoro and Harappa. Deep mines had to be dug and a township needed electricity, and so came up the first Hydel plant in Shivasamudram, delivering 42 MW of AC at 25 Hz to Kolar, the first of its kind in Asia. The transmission line of 147km was the longest in the world at 78kV,the highest voltage in those days.</p>
<p>The Kolar township got electrified, so did Mysore and Bangalore with alternating current.</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity is a perfect renewable energy source. Water vapour from the seas and rivers rise up, form clouds and come down in rains filling lakes, rivers and canals. As the rivers flow, one can place dams and collect water in huge reservoirs. The water is let out and due to free fall acquires kinetic energy which is converted into electricity. Some time water is taken far down through penstocks and made to drive turbines. If you go to Shimshapura half way down to Mysore from Bangalore, you can visit yet another historic hydel station. When power from Shivasamudram could not meet the growing needs, another hydel station was set up from Shimsha river generating 17.2 MW in 1938. Hydel stations serve two purposes. They produce electricity and at the same time help to irrigate lands with the discharge water flowing down canals.</p>
<p>Not far from Mysore is the Krishnarajasagar dam. This is on the Kaveri river. Apart from irrigating land these reservoirs help to provide drinking water.</p>
<p>It is solar energy which causes evaporation. Condensation takes place in the troposphere and gravitational pull causes rains. The cycle goes on and on <em>cleaning the </em><em>air rather than polluting it.</em></p>
<p>The major problems associated with the setting up of hydroelectric stations are deforestation and displacement of population. Strict legislation has considerably controlled both.</p>
<p>In the context of using hydropower and creating canal irrigation in Karnataka state we remember with deep reverence and gratitude the most outstanding engineer and a great human being who was born about 70 km from Bangalore in a village called Muddenahally. He was Sir M. Visvesvaraya (1860-1961).</p>
<p>Visit Muddenahally or Shivasamudram or Krishnaraja Sagar and you will come back with awe that a man could achieve what the great Visvesvaraya had achieved, in engineering, in administration and in propagating education.</p>
<p>He lost his father when he was barely 15 and had his education in different places, finally graduating in engineering and joining the Public Works Department. His brilliance, enterprise and integrity did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>The man who was known to carry two candles, one for his office work and the other which he used to buy with his own money, to carry out his personal work, the man who on the day of his retirement, refused the office car and walked home. He was not trying to impress any one. He wanted to tell the world that it is not enough to be honest but to set extreme examples of how far true honesty should take us and that there is no room for compromise as far as integrity is concerned.</p>
<p>His meticulousness showed in his execution of huge projects. When Krishnaraja Sagar was built, it was possibly one of the largest dams in the world at that time. While planning the Brindavan Gardens, he did not forget the dancing fountains which still cheer millions of visitors.</p>
<p>Visvesvaraya, the boy from Muddenahally, was made the Diwan of Mysore in 1912 and served for seven years in this capacity. After retirement he helped the next Diwan Mirza Ismail as a mentor. Visvesvaraya was knighted by the British in 1915 and fondly referred to as Sir MV ever since.</p>
<p>On one hand Sir MV kept setting up industries, on the other irrigating land to help agriculture. He realized that engineering education was absolutely essential to provide necessary manpower for sustaining both. In 1917, as the Diwan, he set up an Engineering College which is the present University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering. (UVCE).</p>
<p>He was conferred the title of Bharat Ratna by the Government of India in 1955.</p>
<p>There are now 34 dams and 24 hydroelectric stations in Karnataka state. There was a time when all the electricity in Karnataka came from Hydroelectric power. Inspired by the example of Sir MV, it was Indian engineers who designed and executed these dams and Power stations.</p>
<p>Make a trip to Varahi, not very far from Shimoga. The Hydel station there is housed inside a hill. Many years back, when we went there, our car entered a tunnel dug into a hill. After a fairly long drive inside, we stopped and suddenly entered an enormous cave which seemed like Ali Baba’s mysterious cave. It was not strewn with jewels and gold but had modern machines, instruments and gadgets for remote control. There are four generators there, producing 460MW of Power, fed from the river Varahi collected in a huge reservoir atop the hill. Every thing I saw there was “Made in India”.</p>
<p>It was Sir M. Visvesvaraya who gave Indian engineers the password, “Open Sesame”.</p>
<p><em>Sir MV and the Hydl store of Karnataka</em></p>
<p><strong>ELECTRICITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR BREATH OF LIFE</strong></p>
<p>We were sitting in our classroom in Barisal Zilla School. Barisal is a town on the bank of the river Kirtonkhola, now in Bangladesh. It was very hot but there was no fan. In every classroom huge pankhas were fitted from the ceiling. These pankhas were pulled by a rope. A boy of our age called the “pankhapuller’ used to pull the pankhas so that we could study in relative comfort. When my mind goes back to those days I feel upset about the barbarism that was in practice and which unfortunately persists even today since we still exploit child labour. We have seen, going back to the days of Industrial revolution, how Technology has been freeing us from drudgery. Tesla’s invention of induction motors has made fans rugged and cheap and replaced pankhas and painful manual labour.</p>
<p>In Barisal we used to have electricity for four hours in the evening from 6 to 10 p.m. only for electric lights and we had to have kerosene lanterns afterwards.</p>
<p>Electricity spread widely since 1950. Karnataka depended only on hydroelectric power until monsoon failures forced Karnataka to resort to Coal based Thermal power plants in Raichur. There are gas based power plants and Nuclear power plants (Kaiga) to meet the steeply increasing power demand of the state.</p>
<p>The total capacity for generating electric power in India has come up to 250,000 MW about 100 times of what we had earlier. And yet this capacity falls far short of our requirement. We need electricity for almost everything, for lighting, for cooling, for running motors for Industries, for driving pumps for irrigating lands, for communication, for running computers and for radio and televisions. Electricity is indispensable for our daily existence. It is like the breath of our life and yet 400 millions out of 1200 million Indians have no access to electricity or 75 million rural homes out of 155 millions have no electric connection at all not even for lighting in the evening and children have to study in candle lights or kerosene lamps much like our predecessors used animal fat for lighting the caves they lived in.</p>
<p>Refrigerators have become absolute necessities these days. They not only prevent wastage of food but have freed women from the kitchen to some extent. But many cannot afford refrigerators.</p>
<p>Pankhas have been replaced by fans and air conditioners.</p>
<p>Irrigation pumpsets are essential for growing food. Failed monsoons frequently caused droughts and famines when artificial irrigation was not widely available. In 1942, 2-3 million people died as a result of the Bengal famine (the British were also largely responsible for the famine). There are over 18 million pumpsets in India now as against 18000 in 1950 and these have significantly helped the <em>Green Revolution </em>that has increased our food production to a very large extent. Agricultural consumption of electricity comes to about 21% of the total electricity generated.</p>
<p>India’s Industrial growth has been significant and has substantially contributed to India’s growth. Industries use 35% of electrical energy in India.</p>
<p>Apart from electricity, there are other forms of energy, mostly oil, which is primarily needed for transport. The availability of gas cylinders has made life easier for many women in our country. But they constitute a relatively small section of the total population. Chulahs are generally used for cooking in villages and also in cities using fuel wood or dung cakes that are available for free. Fumes from these chulahs are very harmful to health. Women who have to spend long hours at home and in the kitchen are the main victims. In India,fumes from chulahs are believed to cause 3 to 4 lakhs of deaths every year. Use of cooking gas could solve this problem but is unaffordable to most.</p>
<p>As we keep adding up the energy requirements for what are deemed to be essentials in life, which have made our lives more liveable, the figures are staggering. The burgeoning population which has become 1200 million from about 300 million in 1947 and the substantive increase of the essentials of life has made Energy problem one of the most acute and complicated problems for our energy poor nation.</p>
<p><em>Energy is the driver of development and plays a major role in fighting poverty. </em>
<em>At the same time energy production and energy use cause atmospheric pollution.</em></p>
<p>Out of the 250,000 MW of electric power 67% is from Thermal sources, 21% is from Hydel sources and the remaining 18% comes from various other sources out of which 2-3% is from Wind Power and about the same from Nuclear power. Thermal power is mainly obtained from burning coal and Lignite (57%) and that is the main source of atmospheric pollution which desperately needs to be reduced.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that we need to add about 200,000MW of power generating capacity in the next 10 years to meet our basic requirements of electricity, providing electricity for the villagers, sustain Agricultural and Industrial growth. We shall still be far short of China in our consumption of electrical energy. In India the annual average of electricity consumption per capita is around 700 kWh (or units) which is about a quarter of the consumption in China, 1/10 th of the consumption in Western Europe. In US and Canada per capita consumption is around 14000 units.</p>
<p>If we have to add 200,000MW of electricity, much of it has to come from burning coal. If the production of cars continues unabated, oil import will continue to increase. Electricity and Transport, Coal for electricity and oil for cars, will continue to pollute our atmosphere. What are the alternatives open to us? We have to look into these and do our best.</p>
<p><em>Electricity: Our breath of life</em></p>

<p><strong>COAL BASED THERMAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>POWER AND ITS PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p>Our car got held up in a queue. Not at traffic lights but inside a shopping mall. There were a number of cars ahead of us, all burning petrol and the parking space was getting filled with fumes. There were huge exhaust fans running full speed and yet there was a strong foul smell of polluted air. After parking the car, we stood in a queue again for a lift to the sixth floor. Of course the mall was fully air-conditioned and that was a relief. Sunlight hardly reached there but the mall dazzled in artificial light.</p>
<p>Suddenly every thing seemed very odd to me. There we were, burning petrol and using an enormous amount of electricity just for a handful of people to shop in comfort at an expensive place when we learnt earlier that 400 million Indians have no access to electricity and the children have to read in candle light or with kerosene lamps even today! We also learnt that each person in the US and Canada uses nearly 20 times electricity compared to us in India. But within our country one third of our own people cannot use even a single unit of electricity!</p>
<p>If the situation has to be rectified to some extent, we have to add at least 200,000 MW of power generation to the already existing 250,000 MW over the next 10 years. How can we do it? And what would be the consequences? Nearly 57% of the electricity we produce comes from burning coal. More than 50% of the electricity that we intend to produce during the next ten years, we are told, also has to be coal-based.</p>
<p>But isn’t there a great problem of pollution caused by burning coal? There is and we seem to be stuck on the horns of a dilemma.</p>
<p>Let us see what the Coal situation is in India.</p>
<p>India is placed fourth in the world so far as coal reserves is concerned and third as far as its production. Our reserve exceeds 197 billion tons in shallow mines which are mostly distributed in Orissa, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand, Singarani in Andhra Pradesh, Jharia in Dhanbad and in Raniganj, West Bengal and also in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>The calorific value of our coal which means the amount of energy ( heat in calories) that a fixed mass of coal (kg) can produce on burning, is relatively low. Our coal has 15-45 % of ash content but relatively less Sulphur and Nitrogen compounds which are very harmful as we shall presently see. The pollution caused by burning coal is mainly in the form of CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> to the atmosphere and the ash that is left on the ground.</p>
<p>The very act of coal mining causes pollution. Rainwater seeps in through the portions broken open and pollutes ground water. Coal mining is a hazardous and a risky occupation for miners. Improved technology has reduced catastrophic incidences where helpless men got trapped inside and perished.</p>
<p>Coal ash or fly ash as it is called, produces substantial problems. In some places these are left in heaps in the open. Fly ash some time get mixed with ground water or river water. Fly ash often contains heavy metals (mercury) inherent in the coal and these get deposited in ground water and drinking water is severely polluted. Efforts are on to utilize fly ash by making bricks or using them for agriculture.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned earlier, Indian coal is relatively free from Sulphur which forms oxides and once in contact with water in the atmosphere, turn into acids. Heard of <em>acid rain?</em> Apart from the damage to health, acid rains damage habitations and forests. The great monument of <em>Taj Mahal,</em> made of the finest marble has not been completely spared. Marble as you know, reacts with acids, that may rain down, if there are oxides of sulphur or Nitrogen in the exhausts from burning coal emitted into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is the biggest pollutant. The situation is not much better in the U.S. or in China. In US out of 300 GW (i.e. 300,000MW), the effluents from most of coal based generators are not treated according to proposed practices to reduce CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> emission. Both China and US are engaged in setting up large thermal power stations. It may not be generally known that waste from coal may also carry nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Considerable International pressure is building up on India and China to contain CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> emission. India has very little choice, other than use existing methods and also develop technology to reduce CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> emission to a substantive degree. Globally, electricity generation is the largest contributor to climate change, producing more than 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. The environmental damage caused by Worldwide electricity generation is estimated at 2.6 trillion US dollars(130 trillion Indian rupees).</p>
<p>So far as India is concerned we do not have much choice. We cannot stop electricity generation or prevent further growth if we have to make progress and ensure that most of us have access to electricity.</p>
<p>Since our gas and oil reserves are minimal, coal is the only fossil fuel that we may rely on. Hydroelectric power needs to be exploited to the extent possible with minimum ecological damage by deforestation.</p>
<p>As we turn to alternatives, let us minimize losses in generation of electricity, drastically reduce losses in Transmission/Distribution and utilization, contain extravagant use of electricity by imposing penalty and adopt all measures to improve efficiency of all coal based generators planned for the future.</p>
<p><em>Coal based thermal power and its problems</em></p>
<p><strong>ENERGY SAVING</strong></p>
<p><strong>An Alternative source of Energy!</strong></p>
<p>Have you taken a careful look at the veins of a leaf? The sap which is sucked by the roots and transported to the leaves distributes itself all over the leaf through a network of veins for photosynthesis to take place with solar energy. Nature seldom wastes. If you look at how electricity is distributed in our country you will not find any pattern. It is haphazard. As a result nearly 20% of electricity is wasted in its distribution.</p>
<p>But before we come to distribution we have to go through other stages.</p>
<p>Let us take a coal based thermal plant. Coal is washed, crushed and fed into a boiler where steam is produced by boiling water. The pressure and temperature of steam are increased and forced into turbines at different stages and rotate a shaft on which the rotor (the electro-magnet) of the generator is mounted and rotated at 3000 r.p.m (3600 r.p.m.in countries that use power at 60 Hz). These days producing 500MW of power at about 15 kV is common. ( At Raichur the generators produce 220MW each).The voltage is stepped up to say 400kV with the help of a transformer and transmitted to long distances. After it reaches its destination the voltage of the electricity is stepped down in a couple of stages to 11kV and finally to 440 volts before distributing electricity to a number of houses or shops or for running Irrigation pumpsets. We do not get all of 440 volts to our homes available between any two lines or phases but 250 volts between one of the lines (or a phase) and the fourth line called the neutral.</p>
<p>Losses take place at every stage and in our country the losses are often larger than usually happen in most countries. If we feed 100 units of energy through the coal, only 35 units come as electricity into the transmission line. About 3 units are lost in transformation and high voltage transmission and we are left with 32 units.</p>
<p>Almost 10 units are lost in distribution (about 30%) and out of the 22 units that reach home nearly 90% is lost as heat in an incandescent bulb and we get barely 10% as light. This means from coal to an incandescent bulb from 100 units of energy we get only 2 units.</p>
<p>This is not very exciting.</p>
<p>What can we do about this? Generating companies do their best to make power generation more efficient. Much depends on the quality of coal. As has been mentioned earlier, the quality of coal in our country is poor and causes a lot of pollution. Considerable amount of water is required to run a thermal plant. Most modern plants re-circulate water to the extent possible. High voltage transformers and transmission are also reasonably efficient. When it comes to distribution at 11000 volts and 430 volts the system as we have mentioned above is grossly inefficient and produces huge losses. It is incumbent on the Electricity companies to modify the distribution network, taking cue, if need be, from how a leaf distributes its sap and cut down the losses. In most countries Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses are about 10%, whereas in India, varying from one state to another, losses come to more than 30%. If we can even reach 15%, which is not a tall order, we shall have 27 units coming home instead of 22 and we can do with 160,000 MW instead of 200,000 MW in the next 10 years as we had stated earlier.</p>
<p><em>So, saving losses </em>
<em>mainly in distribution </em>
<em>would amount to not </em>
<em>having to generate 40,000 </em>
<em>MW of power which is </em>
<em>more than one seventh of </em>
<em>our installed capacity of </em>
<em>250,000MW and nearly </em>
<em>eight times the power we </em>
<em>generate from Nuclear </em>
<em>power plants.</em></p>
<p><strong>Our role in energy saving:</strong></p>
<p>What should be our role? There is a lot that we can do. Let us get back to the incandescent lamp that Swan and Edison had made 130 years back and we have still been largely using those bulbs. An incandescent lamp, as these are called, are very inefficient. Have you touched a bulb after it is switched off ? Do not try it. They are very hot. Almost 90% of the electrical energy that an incandescent lamp absorbs turns into heat. Only 10% portion turns into light.</p>
<p>So we have to try to replace the inefficient incandescent lamps by Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) for the time being. We hope to have LED s or Light emitting diodes in future. We shall discuss these later. We shall be saving a considerable amount of energy and cost by replacing incandescent lamps.</p>
<p>What about fans? Ceiling fans consume about 100 watts of power. If we keep a fan turned on continuously for 10 hours, we consume 1 kWh of energy. For 30 days it would come to 30 units</p>
<p>And if there are two fans running in your house all night during summer months, 60 units are already spent. It is better to avoid using air coolers.</p>
<p>We must make it a point to switch off fans when we do not need them. If you have the big resistor type of regulator to control the speed of a fan, you will notice that the regulators become very hot. That shows energy is being wasted as heat. Small and cheaper electronic regulators do not consume much electricity and are better if made by a good company.</p>
<p>What about a refrigerator which most urban houses use these days? Their wattage (or power) is about 300 W, depending on the size. Make sure the door is closed after you have opened the fridge. Never place any hot food inside. The motor and the compressor would run for a short while to bring down the temperature to the set value and will not consume much electricity if the door is kept closed.</p>
<p>There are other ways to save energy and we shall discuss these since energy saved means less energy generated and is the best Alternative energy source.</p>

<p><em>Energy saving</em></p>
<p><strong>KEEP SAVING ENERGY</strong></p>
<p>We often leave home with the TV turned on. A very careless thing to do. Our TV consumes about 200 Watts of power and in 5 hours uses 1.0 kWh or one unit of energy for nothing. Every unit counts.</p>
<p>A geyser consumes 1500 to 3000 Watts, depending on whether it is a storage type geyser or an instant geyser. Whatever it may be, it is a power consuming device since using electricity for heating is one of the most inefficient modes of using electricity. We should keep the geyser turned on just as long as it is necessary since a number of families in cities or in towns turn on the geyser around the same time in the morning. The sum total of this simultaneous demands is a large value and the power suppliers find it hard to meet the demands of all consumers. Sooner we turn off the geyser the better for all of us. The best thing would be to install and use a solar heater and use geysers only on cloudy days.</p>
<p>Lighting constitutes a relatively large part of the energy that we consume if we use incandescent lamps. If five such lamps, 100 Watts each, are kept on at the same time for 4 hours, we end up consuming 500x4= 2000 kWh or 2 units a day and 60 units a month.</p>
<p>It is far better to use Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL), each of say 23 Watts. Our electricity consumption will come down by almost 45 units a month! CFLs are no doubt more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps but they last much longer and cost significantly less to run. When Light emitting diodes (LED), now available in torch lights, become commercially viable for domestic use, electricity consumption will be still less.</p>
<p>We told you the story of Edison’s producing incandescent lamps and lighting up Menlo Park one evening. It was considered a miracle in those days in 1890s. Strangely, incandescent lamps have been in use for over 125 years with marginal changes. The carbon filaments originally used by Edison were replaced by Tungsten filaments making filament lamps last relatively longer.</p>
<p>When a current flows through the filament, trillions of electrons flow every second through the maze of atoms of the filament. In the filament of a 100 Watt, 250 volt lamp, 1.57 trillion electrons flow every second. The friction produces heat and also light. Nearly ninety percent of the electrical energy is lost as heat.</p>
<p><strong>FLUORESCENT LAMPS</strong></p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps give us cold light. In a Fluorescent lamp, mercury vapour and some inert gas ( e.g. Argon) are introduced and the inner side of the tube has a coating of fluorescent paint. A stream of electrons is made to flow from one end to the other. The electrons hit the mercury vapour and dislodge electrons from mercury atoms which hit the fluorescent paint and produces light which is cold. The history of its discovery is rather long. Fluorescence by electrical discharge was studied by many scientists going back to Michael Faraday. Even Edison had tried to produce fluorescent lamps but gave up after many attempts. Fluorescent light commonly called <em>neon light </em>were initially used for advertisements. They still are used for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps or <em>Tube lights, </em>as they are commonly called, came into Indian market in 1950s. They save a lot of electricity but are costlier than filament lamps which still cost around Rs 15/-. The ballasts that are used in Tube lights are used to convert 50 Hz power supply into DC and then into high frequency AC to start the electron flow. These were also costly but have now been replaced by cheaper electronic ballasts.</p>
<p>Tube lights are being progressively replaced by narrow helical tubes which are small and are easily fitted into sockets made and used for filament lamps. These, as you may guess, are <em>Compact Flu</em>o<em>rescent Lamps or CFLs</em>. These are small, efficient and are rapidly replacing Incandescent lamps, despite the fact that they are much costlier. Average life of a CFL is about 15000 hours as against 1000 hours for a filament lamp.</p>
<p>The problem with CFL is its disposal after its life. Since the inside of the tube has mercury vapour, it is harmful to dump it and break it,</p>
<p>CFLs are likely to be replaced by Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs in not too distant future. LEDs consume very little power and will reduce electrical energy consumption to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Before we close this section on domestic energy conservation, let me quickly go and check if I closed the door of the refrigerator properly.</p>

<em> of August 1945. A B29 American plane flew </em>
<em>over Japan and dropped a bomb on a Hospital in Hiroshima. Instantly, there was a </em>
<em>huge flash and a ball of fire rose like a mushroom, covering the sky. 70,000 people </em>
<em>died. Of those who did not die instantly, some died later, having lost parts of their </em>
<em>skin, some died months later, having suffered acute agony. Another bomb was dropped </em>
<em>three days later on another city called Nagasaki. Another 50,000 people died. Japan </em>
<em>surrendered and the second world war came to an end.</em></p>
<p>The bombs were nuclear bombs made in America and killed nearly 1.5 lakhs of innocent people.</p>
<p>Other types of bombs, gun powder or explosives are results of chemical reaction. Nuclear explosions are totally different in nature. Before we go into this let us glance through the story of atoms and the basics of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>It was Kanad in India and Democritus in Greece around 500 B.C. who conceived of atoms as the ultimate indivisible matter. <em>Kana </em>is a particle in Sanskrit and <em>Atomos </em>is indivisible in Greek.</p>
<p>It was not until the early nineteenth century (1766-1844) that John Dalton, son of a weaver in England, proposed an atomic theory.</p>
<p>J.J. Thompson in Cambridge, England, showed in 1897 that an atom is divisible and discovered a particle 1/1834 lighter than a hydrogen atom and this particle possessed an electric charge. This charge was assumed to be negative and called <em>Electron</em>. Eventually the existence of <em>Proton </em>which has nearly the same mass as a hydrogen atom and has a positive charge and <em>Neutron </em>having the same mass as proton but no electric charge, were discovered one after the other. We owe our present knowledge about the structure of an atom to Ernest Rutherford (1911), Niels Bohr (1913), James Chadwick (1932) and many other great minds of the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Rutherford visualized an atom as a solar system, with electrons, like planets, orbiting a heavy positively charged nucleus. Niels Bohr modified the rather simplistic but the revolutionary model by Rutherford. He also showed that electrons are on shells. If an atom receives energy, the electron jumps from an inner to an outer shell and from an outer to an inner shell if energy is emitted in packets (later called photons).</p>
<p>Hydrogen, is the simplest of all elements. It has no neutron and has only one electron on the first shell which is capable of accommodating two. An atom is electrically neutral. If there are two electrons in the outer shell like in helium, there are two protons, in the nucleus balancing the charges. There are also two neutrons in the nucleus. Neutrons and protons are bound together by a strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the size of an atom 100,000,000 of hydrogen atoms placed side by side stretch up to <em>one centimeter.</em></p>
<p>An atom is mostly empty space. The nucleus is heavy but 100,000<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> of an atom in size. If an atom is as large as a cricket stadium, the nucleus is like the cricket ball and electrons are as large as mustard grains. Atoms combine together and make molecules. A simple example of molecular formation is given below.</p>
<p>An oxygen atom has two electrons in the first shell and six in the second shell which can accommodate eight electrons. The outer shell of an oxygen atom, therefore, has two vacancies. Two hydrogen atoms with one electron each in their shells combine with one oxygen atom in such a way that they are accommodated in the vacancies of the oxygen atom to give a very stable and wonderful molecule H<span><sub>2</sub></span>O which is water.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements that are identical in every respect but have different number of neutrons in the nucleus. These are called <em>Isotopes</em>. Ordinary hydrogen that pervades the universe has a single proton but no neutrons, as has been stated earlier. It has two other isotopes, one of them is Deuterium and the other is Tritium. Deuterium has one neutron and one proton and tritium has two neutrons. We shall refer to these later.</p>
<p>Uranium is a heavy element and has different Isotopes. Uranium 235, is an Isotope of uranium with 143 neutrons in its nucleus,(but 92 protons, i.e. 51 extra neutrons) If the nucleus of U-235 is bombarded by a neutron, it splits or fissions into two almost equal halves and three neutrons are produced which fly out and if they can hit other nuclei, more neutrons are produced and more and in no time, an <em>uncontrolled chain </em><em>reaction may set in. This is called FISSION REACTION.</em></p>
<p>There is a small reduction of mass when a U235 nucleus fissions and as was shown by Albert Einstein by a simple equation E = mc<span><sup>2</Sup></span>, a very large amount of energy may be produced from a minute reduction of mass since c, the velocity of light is 300,000 km/second and c<span><Sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">2<\/a><\/sup></span> is 90,000,000,000. A nuclear reaction may produce millions of times of energy compared to that of a chemical reaction that takes place at the atomic or molecular level. In a nuclear reaction some of the <em>binding energy </em>that holds the nucleus together may be released.</p>
<p>The enormous energy that is released does the instant destruction. Lethal radiations keep emanating afterwards, leaving its cancerous stamp on humans and animals.</p>
<p>The so-called simple and oft quoted equation relating mass and energy apart from accounting for the huge amount of energy release from a nuclear fission holds other intriguing concepts relating <em>mass and energy</em> and particle physicists often consider these as two names of the same entity.</p>
<p>A brief reference to Madame Curie may not be irrelevant in this context. Fission involves heavy elements some of which emit lethal radiations.</p>
<p>Madame Curie, a Polish scientist who spent many years of her life working on <em>Radioactive elements </em>and discovered <em>Radium and Polonium </em>got the Nobel prize twice. But having worked all the time experimenting with lethal radiations fell a victim to cancer. So did several other experimental scientists as we shall describe later.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein a young man, with long disheveled hair and a shabby jacket, ran no such risks since he worked only with paper and pencil, drawing of course upon great experimental results reported by others and upon his exceptional mind.</p>
<p>Albert was unceremoniously thrown out of his school at the age of fifteen because his Greek teacher thought that this boy would come to nothing and he was an undesirable example for other students in his class.</p>
<p>So, Albert Einstein, thrown out of his school, wandered around for a year and with difficulty managed to get into a University and got a degree. He procured a job of a grade III clerk in a Patent office.</p>
<p>It was there that he worked in his spare time on some basic problems in Physics and in the year 1905 he published five papers which ushered in a new era in physics.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein, it is believed, grieved in his later years blaming himself to some extent for the Nuclear Bomb that killed so many innocent people. As we shall see in the next section, it was he who had advised the U.S. President that research should be undertaken for making nuclear bombs to preempt the Germans. But was he to blame or the war mongers who decided to drop the bombs on Japan?</p>

<p><strong>Albert Einstein.</strong> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">2<\/a><\/sup></span> (which has been dubbed “the world’s most famous equation”), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>

<p><em> Compton : The Italian navigator has landed in the New World</em></p>
<p><em> Conant : How were the natives?</em></p>
<p><em> Compton : Very friendly</em></p>
<p>The Italian Navigator was Enrico Fermi, an outstanding Italian Physicist, Arthur Compton, his assistant<em> </em>and James Conant was of the National Defense Research Commission, U.S., date 20<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> December 1942, place Chicago and the New World was the first controlled nuclear fission. The coded communication was imperative since the second world war was going on. It was apprehended that Germany was trying to make nuclear bombs. Einstein at the instance of Szilard wrote to the US President Roosevelt in 1940 urging him to initiate research on nuclear bombs. That is how the Manhattan project came up where the first atom bomb was tested. Even in 1938 the greatest physicists in Europe were not sure whether fission reaction could actually take place until Lise Meitner, an outstanding physicist, hounded out by the Nazis for being a Jew, let down by her friend Otto Hahn whom she always helped in problem solving, showed mathematically that Nuclear fission was feasible. Enrico Fermi, who earned the Nobel prize when he was 37 years old came to settle in the US. He was allotted a disused squash court by the University of Chicago to carry out his experiments on nuclear fission.</p>
<p>Fermi built his reactor with carbon blocks to slow down neutrons and ensure fission. He made arrangements to control the fission reaction and true to his expectations and much to the excitement of the Physicists around him, the reactor began to work. The first nuclear reactor was thus built in a disused squash court. In those days, the scientists were not aware of the damages radiations could cause. Fermi died of stomach cancer at the age of 53 and so did two of his research students, Madame Curie also fell a victim to the radiations that she was exposed to during years of experiments with radio activity as we mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>True, that Fermi’s experiments helped the construction of the atom bomb but it also started off researches for producing electricity from nuclear fission. There are 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries today, providing 16% of the world’s electricity demand. In India we have 4780 MW of nuclear power generation which is less than 2% of India’s installed capacity for generating electricity.</p>
<p>How does a nuclear reactor operate?</p>
<p>The fuel used in a reactor is uranium. India, like her other energy resources, is short of uranium and has to import much of it even to keep our reactors in operation. The next requirement is the moderator which helps to slow down the neutrons. Heavy water is frequently used for this purpose. Next comes control rods used for controlling fission reaction which in turn controls the heat that needs to be produced. The heat generated is used for producing steam that turns a turbine. The turbine rotates the generator, much like a coal based system.</p>
<p>In India Nuclear power very marginally helps to produce the basic demand of the day. The basic demand or the base load at present exceeds 100 GW. The demand reaches a peak in the morning for water heating and another peak in the evening, mainly for lighting loads. The base load is largely met from Thermal power. It is difficult to rely entirely on Hydroelectric power, since a failed monsoon may seriously jeopardize power supply situation. Since we intend to reduce our dependence on coal-based power plants over the years, we need some source of electrical energy to meet at least our base load. Until recently, it was our plan to increase Nuclear power generation, eventually depending on Thorium of which India has a very large deposit. It was the recent Fukushima Daiichi disaster which has made the world sit up and re-think plans of meeting the future energy needs with reduced dependence on nuclear power.</p>
<p>The first nuclear disaster was at the Three mile Island in the US in 1979, followed by the one in Chernobyl (1986). These accidents alerted the scientists and engineers and measures of safety were enhanced significantly. The Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 has caused maximum concern among the planners. Unfortunately, the Tsunami happening at the same time greatly worsened the situation at Fukushima. The moot question now is whether Nuclear power should be enhanced or closed down as Germany has planned to close down all Nuclear reactors by 2022. France incidentally had more than 70% of its electrical energy coming from Nuclear reactors. It is now slowly phasing out its dependence on nuclear power.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to come to any definite decision in India. The demand of electricity will go on increasing even if moderate economic growth has to be sustained and provide at least the minimum amount of electricity to the 400 million Indians who have no access to electricity. Where will this energy come from? Let us see.</p>
<p><strong>NUCLEAR FUSION</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear energy may also be obtained from FUSION instead of Fission. In fission, a heavy atom is split and in Fusion two very light atoms are fused. In both cases a small mass loss produces large amounts of energy as discussed earlier. Some may not know that the Sun has an enormous Nuclear fusion reactor operating all the time. The fuel in this case is hydrogen.</p>
<p>There are three isotopes of hydrogen as mentioned earlier. The basic form of hydrogen as we know has a single proton, one electron and no neutron and its other isotopes are <em>Deuterium </em>that has a proton <em>and </em>a neutron in the nucleus and the third variety which has two neutrons and one proton. It is called <em>Tritium.</em></p>
<p>If deuterium and tritium are <em>fused</em> or made to unite, we shall have two electrons in the first shell, two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus <em>which gives helium, </em>a very stable element.</p>
<p>There is a mass loss and a huge energy production as a result of this fusion, mostly as heat.</p>
<p>Inside the core of the sun, hydrogen atoms undergo some transitions and at an enormous pressure at about 15 million degrees kelvin, fuse into helium atoms. There is again a mass loss that turn into energy and believe me it is this fusion energy which for over 4.5 billion years is being radiated into space and keeping our planet nicely warm and half of it, facing the sun, brightly lighted up. This is expected to go on for another 5 billion years before our star, the sun runs out of its fuel, mostly hydrogen and becomes a dead star or a White dwarf. But that is a little far into the future for us to be worried about.</p>
<p>Can we not produce energy by fusion since we believe we have sufficient amounts of deuterium and tritium freely available in nature, in sea water for instance. That should meet all our energy needs for millions of years. You must have heard of hydrogen bombs which are far more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. These are based on fusion energy. Decades of research have been going on but with limited success so far to produce controlled fusion energy, even in a laboratory, since we have to produce and contain plasma at about 80 million degrees of temperature for fusion to occur and that has been the biggest impediment so far.</p>
<p>We are still far from our goal which as I just said, with very little side effects will meet our energy needs for millions of years. We have to keep trying but <strong>until such time let us keep using the energy being produced in a huge Fusion reactor 150 million kilometers away from us.</strong></p>

<p><em>More on Global warming</em></p>
<p>We studied in an earlier section that most of the world’s energy resources are from conversion of the energy incident from the sun’s rays. Every day, for the last 4.5 billion years, almost 80 thousand trillion watts or terawatts (TW) of power has been lighting up and heating almost half the face of the earth for nearly 12 hours. Nearly half of the incident energy into the earth is reflected back from clouds and snow covered areas and also radiated back into space.</p>
<p>The earth slowly became warm and reached a thermal equilibrium. Life began to thrive. Man began to burn wood and later fossil fuels. This produced carbon dioxide and methane, the green house gases, but there were enough trees to absorb carbon dioxide and the equilibrium continued. It was after the industrial revolution and all the inventions that we described so far gave us speed, electricity, comfort and entertainments. Our emphasis is on producing electricity which is the most clean and versatile form of energy at the point of use.</p>
<p>We have been using up the fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas at such a rapid rate now that the fuels accumulated over million of years will run out in a few hundred years. Production of electricity has rapidly increased, primarily by burning coal. This has been leading to a huge production of carbon-dioxide.</p>
<p>Carbon-dioxide and methane that are being produced cannot be absorbed at the same rate. The problem is made worse by the indiscriminate felling of trees. The earth is becoming a green house which we had described earlier. The earth and the oceans are absorbing some of the heat that are unable to escape into outer space. As a result, earth’s temperature is gradually increasing. This is described as Global Warming. It has been seen that the global mean temperature has increased by 0.7 degrees centigrade over the last century and is expected to slowly increase by 2 to 4 degrees. If drastic measures are not taken to slow down the use of fossil fuels, there may be extreme weather events and rapid melting of glaciers. When global temperature increases, the volume of water in the oceans will increase and the water level may increase as much as a metre in some places. Low lying countries like Maldives, Singapore, Bangladesh will be inundated and a significant land mass will go under water.</p>
<p>Can we reduce our electricity generation? Not really. Once we get used to a certain level of convenience and comfort, we cannot easily come down from them. In fact the growth and prosperity of a nation have been found to be closely related to the consumption of electricity. Besides, our primary task is to light up homes of one third of our population who have no access to electricity and almost live like the cave men I had told you about during our visit to Kent’s cavern.</p>
<p>All these would mean that more electricity needs to be produced and our installed capacity of about 250GW in India has to be doubled in 10 years although we have to keep making our energy use more efficient by reducing wastage.</p>
<p>Since coal is our main energy source for producing electricity we cannot but use coal for several decades to come but it may cause irreparable damage to our environment.</p>
<p>What is our choice?</p>
<p>Nuclear energy may be considered to be an alternative source of energy, but it comes with its cost, its pollution and dreadful risks.</p>
<p>We have belatedly awoken to the urgency of using alternative, renewable and non-polluting energy sources. Various studies have been made worldwide to estimate the potential of alternative energy. Some studies are overly ambitious and project a scenario where all our present and future energy use, much of which come as oil for transport, electricity for industries, domestic and commercial use, may be replaced within a couple of decades, by alternative energy sources such as Wind, Water and Solar (WWS). Electricity obtained from these sources will meet most of the needs, including a part for transport. At present the maximum power consumed world wide is 12.5 TW according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and is projected to reach 16.9 TW of power by 2030 as global population and living standards rise. The requirement will come down to 11.5 TW since in WWS without any fossil fuels, losses are much less. Out of this requirement Solar is estimated to provide 4.6TW, Wind 5.8 TW, Water including Tidal Turbines, Geothermal plants and Hydroelectric Plants to provide 1.1 TW.</p>
<p>Other studies provide other estimates.</p>
<p><em>What is a common concern is that business as usual will be catastrophic for </em>
<em>this planet of ours</em></p>
<p>Solar power may be used mainly in two ways. In one, sun <em>light </em>is directly converted into electricity using solar cells (<em>Photovoltaic cells)</em>. In the other solar <em>heat</em> is concentrated to heat water to produce steam and generate electricity in the conventional way.</p>
<p><strong>The History of using Solar Power</strong></p>
<p>We started talking about the Sun being the source of almost all our energy but we have not discussed how men started using solar power to meet their needs. Using solar energy to dry food is almost as old as when men started growing food. Back to the 7<span><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-">th<\/a><\/sup></span> century before Christ there is evidence of men using sort of magnifying lenses to focus solar power and start a fire. As the story goes, Archimedes, the famous scientist and Philosopher, used the polished bronze shields used by soldiers to focus solar power and burn wooden ships from Rome trying to besiege Syracuse. That was in the year 212 B.C. The Greek navy tried to verify this in 1973 and recreate the situation. They did succeed in burning a wooden boat at a distance of 50 metres. Roman bath houses were heated using solar energy and the Roman aristocrats enjoyed the luxury of bathing there. In all theses attempts clever men tried to make use of solar power to heat or start a fire with a lens, a religious ritual in many countries a couple of thousand years back.</p>
<p>A Swiss Scientist named Horace de Sanssure built the first solar collector in 1769 and Sir John Hershchel cooked in solar cookers that he improvised during his South African expedition in 1830.</p>
<p><strong>PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS</strong></p>
<p>What about producing electricity from sunlight?</p>
<p>We had to wait for a 19 year old, born in 1820, to discover photo-electricity for the first time. He was Alexandre’ Edmond Becquerel (1820-1891) who belonged to an illustrious family of scientists in France. Edmond, as he was commonly called, was the son, a pupil and assistant of Antoine Cesar Becquerel, a distinguished physicist. Edmond helped his father in experiments and also carried out his own. Once he was working with Silver chloride in an acidic solution in an electrolytic cell and he noticed that a voltage appeared across two platinum electrodes immersed in the solution when light fell on the solution. The voltage disappeared when light was withdrawn. No one till then had noticed this and it came to be known as “Becquerel effect.”</p>
<p>Many others like Heinrich Hertz experimented with photoelectric effect. Heinrich Hertz who was trying to see whether electromagnetic waves can travel through space as Clerk Maxwell had predicted mathematically, observed that ultraviolet rays affected the length of sparks in the gap of a metal ring when electromagnetic waves passed through the ring.</p>
<p>Philipp Lenard, a Hungarian physicist took up experiments on Photoelectric emission and he found in 1902 that the energy of the photoelectrons emitted by shining light depended on the frequency of the light. This observation could not be explained by wave theory of light which was by then firmly established.</p>
<p>It was then that Einstein came out with a bold theory (1905). He quantized light and proposed a <em>Corpuscular theory</em>. (By light we do not mean only the visible section but the entire electromagnetic spectrum that we have discussed earlier). If monochromatic light of frequency f passes through vacuum at velocity c, Einstein suggested that the light is made of packets or <em>quanta</em> of energy (later called <em>photons</em>) where the energy e of each <em>photon</em> is given by e=hf, h is Planck’s constant which relates the f of wave nature of light with its quantum nature (e) on the left side of the equation. Light of higher frequency is made of high energy <em>photons</em>. When light is more intense or the amplitude of the wave is large, it indicates there are large number of <em>photons</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now try to understand <em>photoelectric effect</em> that had been experimentally observed by several scientists over decades.</p>
<p>In the <em>photoelectric effect, </em>electrons are emitted from a material when light is incident on its surface. An electron is ordinarily bound to the material unless sufficient energy is supplied for it to escape from the surface. In order to be emitted, an electron must receive from a <em>photon </em>a minimum amount of energy which is called the <em>Work </em><em>Function </em>(W) of the surface. If the incident <em>photon </em>supplies energy that exceeds the work function, the electron escapes with greater kinetic energy given by e-W= hf-W. When light is shone on a shining metal plate, the knocked out electrons captured in an electric circuit produce a voltage difference which makes electric currents to flow. When the light is more intense there are more <em>photons </em>which knock out more electrons and that is how in a solar panel we receive maximum electrical energy during mid-day.</p>
<p>Einstein’s theory was received with skepticism but proved to be right, paving the way to Quantum theory. Einstein received the Nobel prize in 1921 for his photoelectric theory.</p>
<p>That sunlight can be used to produce electricity for commercial use and to be a major source of energy was beyond anyone’s dream at that time. It was in the year 1954 that Bell Laboratories made the first photovoltaic cell. The use of these cells for energy production was still far from being a commercial proposition until 1959 when Explorer satellite was launched with 1600 PV cells (1cm2cm each ) and served in charging up the battery inside. Solar cells became a regular feature in space satellites since in the absence of alternative sources, cost of the PV cells were inconsequential. Further researches led to more efficient solar cells and the cost has been progressively coming down.</p>
<p>A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity (dc or direct current). The practical Silicon solar cells were developed in Bell Laboratories around 1960. Their efficiency has been improved from an initial 4% to over 25% which means, about one quarter of the incident solar energy may be converted into electricity. The electricity that may be produced from one square meter panel of solar cells is 250 Watts. In other words, 4 hectare (1ha=10,000 sq.metre) of solar panels can produce 1MW of power. Roof tops in domestic, commercial and office buildings are at present very marginally being used to install solar panels. The cost of solar panels have now come down to 7-8 crores per MW from 15 crores a couple of years ago, (as against about 3-5 crores for 1MW for coal-based power production) and is distinctly less than real costs of installing nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Solar power generation is non-uniform, starting from zero in the morning peaking at mid day and becoming zero again on sunset. On an average it provides 10-11hours of energy in tropical countries. The unusually low cost of fossil fuels, especially of oil till the “oil shocks” of 1973 and 1979, nations were complacent and very little work was done to promote alternative sources of energy which did not seem cost-effective.</p>
<p>Solar panels need to be covered by glass to protect them from being abraded, especially in desert areas where sand storms are common. This adds to the cost.</p>
<p>Solar energy not being available during evenings ought to be stored to meet the needs of lighting.</p>
<p>Storage of solar energy in storage batteries enhances the cost significantly and has been a strong disincentive for the use of solar cells. The improvement in inverter and metering technology now enables direct current from solar panels to be inverted into ac to be “fed” into the grid, “for safe keeping”. Domestic users of solar panels may also “ store” energy in the grid system, drawing from there as required.</p>
<p><strong>SOLAR HEATING</strong></p>
<p>A number of homes in India have installed solar heaters on the roofs and the morning peak load for water heating is partially reduced as a result. Apart from the distributed solar heaters for water heating, large scale use of heat from the sun to produce electricity is a serious option. Heat from the sun is concentrated in CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) and used to heat water to produce steam which in turn produces electricity in the usual way <em>without any carbon emissions. </em>The land mass required for using solar heat is about the same as in producing electricity from solar panels.</p>
<p>Solar panels with PV cells are also fitted with tubes through which water is circulated. This achieves water heating and electricity production simultaneously and becomes more cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong>HYDROELECTRIC POWER</strong></p>
<p>Hydroelectric power, the conventional ones, that we began our journey with into the electrical world has been exploited to a reasonably large extent. World over it exceeds 900 GW (1GW=1000MW) including small hydel plants of which China has 58%. Canada is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world. The trend in both Canada and the United States has been towards microhydel plants because these have negligible environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Tidal energy is an energy form which does not originate in the sun. It comes mainly form earth-moon interaction. Tidal barrages are built to hold water during high tides and release at low tide. Considerable amount of renewable energy is inherent in it. Tidal turbines are to be used to produce electricity.</p>

<p><strong>MORE ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY</strong></p>
<p><em>Wind Energy</em></p>
<p>If you visit some villages in the Netherlands or some islands in Greece, you will see old windmills still being used, not for producing electricity but mainly for threshing corns. In two earlier chapters we had learnt about wind, how it is produced and how it helped sailing across oceans.</p>
<p>The potential of wind as a major alternative energy source has been recognized relatively recently and a 30% annual growth rate has been achieved. The present installed capacity exceeds 200 GW and the total amount of economically extractable power has been estimated to exceed the total installed capacity from all sources at present.</p>
<p>Usually, a wind farm consists of 100 or more wind turbines in a row, feeding electricity to a common transmission system. The generators used are usually <em>Induction generators</em> which do not need a separate dc excitation. Unlike in solar cells, electricity generated by wind power is alternating current, feeding into an ac grid.</p>
<p>Wind usually drops during the day and blows after evening. Hence wind power and solar power are complementary to each other, wind power being higher during evenings and night when solar power drops to zero. The plant load factor (plf) of wind power varies between 20 and 35 per cent. What is plant load factor? It is the ratio of the total units (kWh) of energy generated in a year divided by the total energy in kWh the generator can produce if it runs full capacity for the total number of hours in a year (8760 hrs.) It is estimated that wind energy provides 430 TWh of electrical energy globally at present. Nearly 19% of electricity used in Denmark comes from wind power. China, Europe and the United States have been making more use of wind power more than other countries and plan to enhance their wind power capabilities to a very significant extent.</p>
<p><strong>Storage of wind energy</strong></p>
<p>It has been envisaged that with suitable transmission network wind energy during evenings may take over when solar power is unavailable. In view of the uncertainty of wind power availability, storage of energy is essential. <em>Pumped storage scheme </em>is a convenient way of storing electrical energy. In this scheme machines placed at lower levels pump water to a higher level when surplus power is available and stored in a reservoir. The stored water is allowed to run down and produce electricity when required. The motor/ pump system used to pump up water is used as turbine/ generator to produce electricity.</p>
<p><em>Pumped storage scheme </em>is a convenient way of storing electricity from intermittent sources.</p>
<p><em>Offshore Wind Power Generation</em></p>
<p>Europe leads the rest of the world in off shore wind power generation. There are 39 offshore wind farms already in operation in western Europe with 2396 MW installed capacity. More than 100 GW of offshore projects are already planned and being installed there. United Kingdom (UK) has a large number of offshore wind farms. Canada has been installing a number of offshore farms on the lakes and a 400MW of suspended wind farm is planned over the lake Ontario. Wind speed is usually higher over the sea and electricity is available for longer hours. Off shore wind farms are much less obtrusive than those onshore.</p>
<p>Small onshore wind power, even those which are owned individually are being encouraged by electric companies which buy up or “store” wind power for smaller agencies.</p>
<p>Solar Power and Wind power are planned as major sources of alternative energy and substantive investments are being made for both. Wind power costs about Rs 5 crores per MW, less than what solar power installation costs at present.</p>
<p><strong>Geothermal energy</strong></p>
<p>Remember when we took a peep into the inside of the earth? We had seen hot gases and molten lava. There are places where geothermal energy erupts as volcanoes and hot water geysers where hot water mixed with steam gushes out. Geothermal energy may be used for producing heat and indirectly saving electricity used for heating water. Geothermal energy is also being used for producing electricity. The worldwide installed capacity for producing electricity adds upto 11GW as of now. Future projections vary as widely as 35GW to 2000GW.</p>
<p>One of the major deterrents in extracting geothermal energy, apart from creating seismic disturbances, is emission of CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> which is about 400kg per MWh of energy. This is much less than that from a coal-based power plant but it brings forth other noxious gases like Methane, Hydrogen Sulphide and Ammonia.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean Thermal Energy</strong></p>
<p>The temperature difference between the surface of the ocean and at a depth may be as high as 20 degree Celsius in tropical regions and may be utilized for energy production. A substance like Ammonia with low boiling point may be evaporated by using the difference in temperature and circulated to run an engine to produce electricity. This, however has low thermal efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Bioenergy</strong></p>
<p>Bioenergy or biofuels are used for producing electricity and also as bioethanol, a substitute for petrol. Bioenergy is derived from plants or plant waste which had absorbed energy from the sun and stored it. Bagasse, the fibrous waste of plants are used as fuel in furnaces to produce electricity. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel. Today it constitutes only a very small portion of the overall energy supply. Biomass electricity is on the rise in a number of European countries. The total installed capacity in the world is estimated at 50GW.</p>
<p>Bioethanol is being produced in Brazil and US and biodiesel largely in Germany. Annual biofuel production in the world exceeds 50 billion litres.There is a concern that production of biofuel may affect food production in a country like India and needs to be planned carefully.</p>
<p>Solar thermal and photovoltaic, offshore and onshore windpower, large and small hydropower will be the largest providers of alternative energy. Biofuels, Ocean energy, thermal and mechanical (tidal) will also provide their shares.</p>

<p>Our universe is thought to have begun 13.7 billion years ago as an infinitesimally small, infinitely hot andinfinitely dense something and it began to expand very fast. Matter evolved, galaxies were formed and our galaxy the Milky way was formed, and one star out of billions of stars in our galaxy is the Sun from which the earth came out and that is where we evolved the humans and that is in brief the story of our Universe of which we know of a minute fraction</p>
<p><strong>THE END OF THE ENERGY TRAIL</strong></p>
<p>It seems like a miracle, does it not, that our earth which is like a speck of dust in this endless Universe, every thing is right, every thing is in its place so that life could spring forth and I should be telling you a story and some of you may have been listening to me.</p>
<p>It is the story of energy. Energy which is bestowed on us by the sun, gives and sustains life. Like other planets, the earth spilled out of the sun and started orbiting it. That was 4.5 billion years ago. Then a “rogue planet” grazed past the earth and the mass of the moon spilled out and started rotating round the earth. The earth got tilted and so we have different seasons in the year.</p>
<p>The inside of the earth is filled with molten lava and further inside, with iron,nickel and other metals and the core is a solid mass which is a magnet. The core produces magnetic fields that deflect some rays that would have been lethal for life to grow. The earth is covered by an atmosphere which is like a concrete roof over the earth and many meteors and meteorites heading for the earth get burnt, sparing the earth from being destroyed. Celestial bodies brought a mysterious liquid for us which has all the right properties for producing and sustaining life. It is water. The crevices and gorges on the earth were filled with water and the oceans were formed. Water froze into glaciers and icebergs near the poles which float since water has a strange property where its solid form is lighter than its liquid form. The floating ice cover was a wonderful lid that prevented the oceans from getting too cold and freeze into a solid mass and so marine life could thrive underneath. Plants grew inside the oceans, grass and trees grew on the surface of the earth. Green leaves having a strange chemical called Chlorophyll which help photosynthesis that absorb light from the sun and turn Carbon dioxide and sap into food that make trees grow.</p>
<p>When trees died and fell down they went inside the earth and after millions of years turned into coal, one of our fossil fuels that we keep burning and fill our planet with noxious fumes. Decayed marine life filled crevices below the oceans with oil which we have been burning in trillions of litres.</p>
<p>We, humans, came to this planet relatively recently. We suddenly invented how to produce fire. We began to burn dry wood and cook. We invented how to produce light by burning fat with algae as wick. Caves where we lived in total darkness lighted up. We learnt to make tools which helped us to hunt and also make boats. We began to travel. Wind that solar heat helps to produce and the earth’s rotation helps to blow helped us to sail.</p>
<p>During this period, our energy needs were very limited. We used sun’s light and heat and burnt wood for making fire. We used animals to carry us and wind for sailing across the oceans. We discovered metal, coal and oil, made instruments and weapons and we needed more and more of them for fighting each other.</p>
<p>Then came the Industrial revolution as we began to make steam to work for us.</p>
<p>We needed more coal and more steel. Then we invented rail engines to take us from one place to another. Then we invented the internal combustion engine and made automobiles. We learnt to fly. We used more and more oil. We have been burning fossil fuels and polluting the atmosphere. In less than two hundred years our energy use has gone sky high and we have begun to fight for oil. We are using enormous amount of energy in our war preparations and draining the earth’s meagre reserve.</p>
<p><em>Then came the second Industrial revolution, our discovering electricity, producing </em>
<em>it and making it work for us. </em></p>
<p>We need to burn enormous amount of coal for producing electricity. We use it for lighting up and turning nights into days. We use electricity to run huge motors and small motors which do all sorts of work for us, keeping us cool in summer and warming us when it turns cold. Life, for some has become more comfortable. Travelling has become faster, communication can be made in nano seconds.</p>
<p>Nuclear power was thought to be an infinite source of energy at our disposal. The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the lingering radiations followed later by the failure of a few nuclear reactors brought home the lethal nature of nuclear power. The recent Fukushima disaster in the nuclear reactors in Japan has alerted the world and several countries are going to wind up nuclear energy production. Germany is leading the way.</p>
<p>We have realized, rather belatedly, that we are draining mother earth of all her energy reserves and we shall have nothing left after a hundred years. Nuclear energy may not be the infinite source of energy that we thought earlier and we have serious reservations about it now. We must again turn back to Solar energy and Wind energy but use them with much greater skill and efficiency compared to what we used to do thousands of years back. Alternative energy forms using wind, solar and hydro energy, geothermal and ocean energy which are all renewable and the cleanest of all need to be our choice. Most importantly these energy sources do not make the planet unlivable. How are we placed in India? Not very comfortably and we have to do every thing that we can to save energy and use it equitably.</p>
<p><em>Nature gives us solar energy in abundance and that needs to be our primary </em><em>choice</em>.</p>
<p>Most important of all, Peace must prevail and the utterly devastating use of energy for war or for its preparation must come to an end if humanity has to survive.</p>
<p>I tried to tell you these stories so that you know how lucky we have been to be born and nurtured into this wonderful earth and how we have the responsibility of saving this beautiful planet.</p>
<p>I remember a song ( not one of Tagore’s) that I had heard when I was a child and have not heard ever since. I translate it for you:</p>
<p>“<em>O, mother earth! All I can leave behind for you </em></p>
<p><em>Are two drops of tears.</em></p>
<p><em>I plundered you and squandered what I plundered </em></p>
<p><em>And when it came to giving something back,</em></p>
<p><em>All I found were tears of repentance.</em></p>
<p><em>The end of the energy trial: where have we come</em></p>
