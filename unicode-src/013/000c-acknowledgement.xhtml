		<p>In all humility I offer my heartfelt gratitude to the Almighty for opening this window of opportunity to enable me to embark on a spiritual journey in re-narrating this monumental story of the Lord.</p>
		<p>I offer my sincere thanks to Shri. Pranesh S, Managing Director, of Prism Books Pvt. Ltd., and Shri Subba Rao, former CEO of Amrita Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, for reposing faith in me and asking me to retell this Divine epic, a most daunting task. This work would not have been possible but for the constant encouragement the two of them gave me through its progress. I was especially inspired and motivated by Mr. Subba Raoâ€™s guidance and suggestions at various stages which also allowed me perceptions that enabled me to recount a saga of such mammoth proportions, without bias.</p>
		<p>I acknowledge in all humbleness the several erudite and scholarly personalities who have narrated the Ramayana through the ages, and whose books I have been reading since childhood. The starting point among them was the all-time favourite <em>Ramayana </em>by Sri C. Rajagopalachari. I refreshed my memory with various versions of the epic including Srimad Valmiki Ramayana by Gita Press, Ramcharitramanas of Sri Tulsidas, Kamba Ramayana and contemporary writings on it.</p>
		<p>My research on the <em>Ramayana</em> before embarking on this monumental work also led me to listen to discourses in Tamil by scholars on the subject.</p>
		<p>My parents, husband, son and daughter, contributed to my endeavour by recalling episodes from the epic to help me keep my narrative close to the classic version as revealed by the great sage, Valmiki. I do not have enough words to thank my sister, Mrs. Sowmya Rangarajan, whose contribution towards editing this work, has been monumental.</p>
		<p>Finally, for every one of my books published by Prism Books Pvt. Ltd., I would remain thankful to Mr. Sreesha Belakvadi and Mrs. Nalini Murali for introducing me to the publishers.</p>
