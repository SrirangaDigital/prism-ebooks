		<p><strong>The Ramayana</strong></p>
		<p>My first exposure to the epics, and Ramayana in particular, came about when I was still in my single digit years. It was through my paternal grandmother who stayed with us. She was a good story teller, who would carry stories through to their conclusion with expressive eyes and a voice that articulated so well, the emotion experienced by each character.</p>
		<p>I wonder at the number of times she’d have regaled me with episodes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Krishna Leela and a string of other tales from mythology — Dhruva, Prahlad, Satyavan-Savithri — the list could go on.</p>
		<p>Well, those were years when I saw everything – people and characters only in two colours - black and white. There were no shades of grey. Kaikeyi, Ravana, Manthara, Soorpanakha and a host of others snugly fit into the black slot. The amusing and adorable Hanuman who sported a ridiculously long tail and had a capacity to assume any size, who thought and acted like a human being, was obviously white. The protagonist, Rama, his consort, brothers and many others who helped them during their years of exile, were all the good people labelled white.</p>
		<p><em>Ramayana</em> to me, then, was just another fairy tale except that Rama and Hanuman were gods who we worshipped, and prayed to. However, years later, as I sat down to pen this prose of mammoth proportions, the task before me appeared overwhelming. Questions that I had not raised as a kid, reared their head through adolescence and led me on a quest, seeking answers. Several reads of Valmiki’s version and other interpretations of the <em>Ramayana</em> only added to my confusion. Paradoxes and contradictions were many when I viewed the epic from a plethora of angles – the moral, ethical, logical, practical, and the mythological.</p>
		<p>It was indeed a paradox that I myself experienced – retelling the <em>Ramayana</em> was at once easy, and tough, when Mr. Subba Rao asked me to keep the storyline in line with Valmiki’s classic version! I present this narrative in the hope I have done justice to the classic poem.</p>
