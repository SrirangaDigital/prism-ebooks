		<img src="images/013_Text_img_0.jpg" alt="logo" />
		<p>Dasharatha’s sons soon settled down to life of householders. Kaikeyi’s brother Yudhajit, invited his nephew Bharata, to visit Rajagriha, the capital of the Kekaya kingdom. Shatrugna who was Bharata’s inseparable companion, accompanied him.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the ageing Dasharatha wished to hand over the reins of his kingdom to the younger generation. As a first step in this direction he desired to install Rama, his first-born as regent.</p>
		<p>Dasharatha’s decision was in keeping with royal norms of designating the eldest son as prince regent. In addition, the king fairly adjudged Rama to be most worthy of this station. He turned over in his mind the traits of his eldest son who remained a stoic in the face of life’s contrasts. Who could be more worthy than the compassionate Rama who was replete with talents and suave of speech, to continue the Ikshvaku lineage? Was Rama not a valiant and courageous warrior, a votary of truth and righteousness who had mastered the Vedas? Was Rama not unflinching in his devotion to his father, and to the people and kingdom of Ayodhya?</p>
		<p>Dasharatha deeply reflected thus, on Rama’s worthiness to become prince regent. He then held court with his ministers and counselors. He was delighted that the assembly, in unison, concurred with his decision. Without any delay, as bid by their king, the ministers began preparations for Rama’s installation ceremony. While Ayodhya was agog with a flurry of activity to carry out Rama’s installation ceremony, Dasharatha became distraught on account of a portentous dream he had. He wished to expedite Rama’s coronation. He was also keen to perform the ritual during Bharata’s absence from Ayodhya. Dasharatha was certain of Bharata’s innate goodness and piety, and was aware of his love for, and loyalty towards Rama. Yet, an element of doubt caused him to feel restless and he argued within himself: “The minds of men are not entirely predictable, they could be unstable.” Dasharatha duly conveyed his resolve to his council of ministers and then summoned Rama to his private chamber. The emperor, thereupon asked Rama to observe, along with Sita, the obligatory formalities leading to his ceremonial installation.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Manthara</h2>
			<p>Ayodhya was bathed in a riot of colours and wore a festive look. The city fibrillated with activity as its citizens prepared to witness the much awaited event. Manthara, Kaikeyi’s hunchbacked maid was puzzled at the sudden rush of activity in the capital. She wondered why Kausalya was making generous gifts of wealth to the priests of the kingdom. When Manthara learned the reason for these gestures, she immediately rushed to Kaikeyi. She agitatedly addressed the queen who was relaxing in bed: “Wake up, you innocent woman from your delusions! How can you rest so peacefully when you are in grave danger!”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi was amused at Manthara’s outburst and asked her the reason for her anger. Manthara raged, “Do you not see that preparations are afoot to ruin you? Rama is to be installed as Prince Regent tomorrow. The arrogant Kausalya is gleefully distributing gifts to people.”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi laughed when Manthara admonished her in this manner. She said, “But these are good tidings that you have brought me. The news of my beloved Rama’s forthcoming coronation is a cause for rejoicing!” She further reprimanded Manthara for entertaining unkind thoughts about Rama who loved her and respected her as much as he did his own mother Kausalya. “Who is more deserving of the crown than the virtuous Rama who is the epitome of Truth and Righteousness? Shame on you Manthara, for thinking so unkindly of my dear son!”</p>
			<p>But Manthara was unrelenting. “How can you be so naïve, silly woman! Do you not see that the king has played foul in arranging for Rama’s installation when Bharata is away! You and your son will now become slaves to Rama and his mother Kausalya once Rama is invested with the office of prince regent! Go, ask the king for what is rightfully yours! Get the throne for Bharata and have Rama banished to the forest for fourteen years!”</p>
			<p>Manthara was so forceful in her arguments that she convinced Kaikeyi to covet the throne for Bharata. The seeds of poison sown by the maid took firm hold of Kaikeyi. She asked, “But how do I accomplish this impossible task, Manthara? Is it not the norm and privilege of a king’s eldest and worthy son to succeed his father? How then, can I ask for Bharata to be installed as regent?”</p>
			<p>Manthara reminded Kaikeyi of the two boons Dasharatha had promised her long ago. A young Dasharatha, in order to help Indra, had once fought a war against the demon Timidhwaja, also known as Sambara. Kaikeyi had accompanied Dasharatha on his chariot. When he fell unconscious after being grievously wounded, she rode his chariot to safety and nursed him back to health. Dasharatha appreciated her timely action and was grateful to her for it. To show his profound gratitude for her admirable deed, he granted her two boons. Kaikeyi had then responded by saying, “I shall ask these boons of you when I need them.”</p>
			<p>Manthara interrupted Kaikeyi’s reverie. “Now is the time for you to hold your husband to his promise. Ensure the crown for Bharata and exile for Rama. Fourteen years is good enough time for Bharata to prevail over the people of Ayodhya and prove his worthiness to them!”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kaikeyi invokes the boons</h2>
			<p>Kaikeyi promptly acted upon Manthara’s evil counsel. On the eve of Rama’s investiture, Kaikeyi strode with determination, to the sulking chamber of the palace. She rid herself of all ornaments, let her hair down in a disheveled state, and slumped down on the floor. Dasharatha who was eager to share the forthcoming event with his favourite queen, came looking for her. He was informed that she had retired to the sulking room in an extremely angry mood. The king was distressed to hear this, and he immediately proceeded to see her. When he saw her lying sprawled on the floor in a distraught state, he begged her to reveal the reason for her sudden sorrow.</p>
			<p>Without much fuss, Kaikeyi told him that she now wanted him to grant the two boons he had promised her long ago. An unsuspecting Dasharatha said he would be only too happy to make good his promise. Kaikeyi, unabashedly looked into the king’s eyes and made her claims. Dasharatha was stunned into speechlessness. He wondered if he was having a bad dream! When he recovered from the initial shock, he realized it was reality in its most cruel garb. He agonized at the unreasonable demands made by her. He tried to make her see reason and elaborated on Rama’s virtues. He reminded Kaikeyi of her own love for Rama and the measure in which Rama reciprocated his affections for her. But Kaikeyi was beyond reason. She was relentless in the pursuit of her goal. She taunted the honourable Ikshvaku descendant for going back on his words.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha could not believe his eyes and ears. It seemed incredulous that his beloved queen had assumed such a ruthless and demoniac character. Dasharatha lost his cool and acted like one demented. He raved and ranted, feeling helpless at his plight. He lamented at the misfortune that had suddenly befallen him. He wondered at the evil that possessed Kaikeyi. Neither reason, nor pleading for sympathy moved her. Dasharatha transgressed all bounds of decorum and went down on his knees, pleading with Kaikeyi to be merciful. The queen only spewed more venom, scoffed at him and turned away from his entreaties. Dasharatha collapsed and fell to the floor from sheer exhaustion.</p>
			<p>When Dasharatha recovered from the swoon, he rose and wailed at his predicament. “How will I break this terrible news to Kausalya? How will I tell her that I am the reason for the fate that has befallen her dear son? How will I face Sita with such evil tidings? What will I tell the people of Ayodhya who are joyfully preparing for Rama’s investiture? How can I bear to send my dear Rama to the forest?”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha who was aggrieved and angered by Kaikeyi’s unscrupulous demands, alternated between volleying harsh words at her, and beseeching her to show compassion. The old king appeared to have aged several years in a matter of hours. He bemoaned his folly and misfortune in having taken Kaikeyi for his queen, a woman who was so full of bile and venom.</p>
			<p>Night gave way to a new dawn, and with it arrived the day of Rama’s coronation. Sage Vasishta who was ready to initiate the pre-coronation rituals, asked Sumantra to inform Dasharatha that they must perform the ceremony without further delay as the auspicious time for its conduct, was running out. Dasharatha was still in a state of stupor when Sumantra arrived to convey Vasishta’s message. Kaikeyi used this to her advantage and asked Sumantra to summon Rama to her palace because the king desired to see him.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-2.3">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama honours his father’s promise</h2>
			<p>Rama who had completed all the pre-installation rituals, left with Sumantra to meet his father. He became apprehensive when he saw Dasharatha’s fatigued appearance and distressed look.<strong> </strong>He bowed to his father and king, with due respect. Dasharatha who had a caged look, stared vacantly at Rama and did not acknowledge his greeting. He had become extremely exhausted by the events of the night and gravity of the situation. He felt so weighed down by guilt, that he could barely look his son to his eyes, or even utter his name.</p>
			<p>Rama was unable to comprehend the king’s strange behavior which was so uncharacteristic of him. “Why is father looking so agitated? Have I unwittingly offended him that he is so angry with me?” Rama asked Kaikeyi.</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi who was already deep in the arms of evil, made a calculated and crafty move upon hearing Rama’s words. She replied, “Rama, he is neither in anguish nor is he angry with you. It is just that in keeping his promise to me, he has to convey unpleasant tidings to you. For an honourable and righteous king, it is not appropriate to go back on his words. I will tell you what ails him, if you are prepared to execute his wish.</p>
			<p>Rama who was extremely pained to hear Kaikeyi’s words, humbly assured her. “Mother, I feel ashamed that I have given you room for entertaining such doubts about my devotion to father. I would be only too glad even to give up my life at his bidding. His wish is my command. Please tell me what is it that he wishes me to do.”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi grabbed the opportunity before her and apprised Rama of the boons and how when he heard her wishes, Dasharatha showed unwillingness to grant them. Rama remained unperturbed by Kaikeyi’s revelation, and assured her that, as a dutiful son, he would willingly and happily, honour his father’s promise to her. Kaikeyi who was overjoyed to hear this, made sure that Rama would not delay embarking on his journey to the forest.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha who had remained silent all this while, gave a weak cry of despair and agony when he heard Rama’s words. He fell down unconscious. Kaikeyi remained unmoved. She urged Rama to expedite his move to the woods. Rama gently picked his father up, and before leaving the chamber, spoke to Kaikeyi: “I covet neither the kingdom nor wealth nor the material comforts of this world. I would forever be on the side of Truth and Righteousness. I would go any lengths, even at the cost of my life, to serve my father. Let noble Bharata rule Ayodhya.”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha was tongue-tied with grief and wept bitterly as Rama departed, to break the news to his mother Kausalya. The queen mother was devastated when Rama detailed the turn of events to her. She wailed without restraint, and chided her husband for having lost his sense of fairness, for submitting to the unreasonable demands made by Kaikeyi.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana was infuriated with the king’s conduct and pronouncement. He asked Rama to ignore the biddings of a king gone senile and turned foolish, bullied as he had been, by an evil woman. Lakshmana argued with Rama saying that when situations demanded, it was necessary to go against the wishes and command, even of a father or teacher. “When one fails to distinguish between right and wrong, when one’s judgement becomes cloudy and he errs from the path of righteousness, it is only fair that you should not support the cause. Does father have just reasons for stripping you of your right to kingship? What wrong have you done to deserve being banished from Ayodhya?”</p>
			<p>Kausalya joined hands with Lakshmana in this tirade against Dasharatha. She too advised Rama against fulfilling Dasharatha’s wishes because they merited no worth. Rama remained unwavering in his resolve to carry out his father’s promise. He consoled Kausalya and Lakshmana by giving examples of Parashurama, Sage Kandu, and of King Sagara’s sixty thousand sons who had discharged with great pride, what their respective fathers had commanded. He also extolled the virtues of righteousness, truth and piety to Kausalya, and sought her permission to leave for the forest.</p>
			<p>Rama, who was steady of mind, pacified Kausalya and Lakshmana saying that his expulsion from Ayodhya was destiny driven, and not the handiwork of Kaikeyi or Dasharatha, who were but instruments in fate’s hands. Lakshmana, however, refused to accept Rama’s explanations. He rebuked him for taking refuge in fate to comply with their father’s irrational wish. Lakshmana suggested that Rama should take up arms against injustice and fight for what was right. He said, “Noble brother, you would be doing this in the interests of our people, for the welfare of Ayodhya.” The son of Sumitra was all set to fight on behalf of Rama. His voice reflected the intense anger he felt. He said, “Are these weapons in my possession, embellishments to enhance my physical charm! Of what use are they if I cannot deploy them to fight and trounce enemies, dear brother!”</p>
			<p>Rama who was determined to honour his father’s pledge, fended every plea and admonishment with apt reply. Kausalya realized the futility of arguing with Rama. She, however, begged him to allow her to accompany him to the forest. Rama firmly reminded her of her duty towards Dasharatha. He reiterated that the king needed her support now more than ever, in this dark hour when he felt betrayed by his most cherished wife, Kaikeyi. “If you desert father now, especially after I leave for the forest, he will certainly not survive. You have to be his pillar of support, mother,” insisted Rama. Kausalya recognized the finality in Rama’s tone and resigned herself to the fact that she would not be able to sway him from his stand. She blessed him and bid him do as he deemed right.</p>
			<p>Rama took his mother’s blessing and proceeded to inform Sita of the latest developments. Sita who heard out Rama patiently, was equally firm in her resolve.</p>
			<p>“My abode is where you dwell – be it here in the palace or in the jungles.” Through the tears that welled up in Sita’s eyes as she spoke to him, Rama could see the steely determination in those soft, lotus petal-like eyes.</p>
			<p>Rama’s attempts to convince Sita of the hardships of a nomadic life in the forest, failed to impress her. “What fear would I have in the forest, of the beasts that live in the wild, when I have you, to protect me?” she asked. Sita expressed joy on being given this opportunity to live in the lap of nature, surrounded by mountains, rivers, rivulets, fruit and flower trees and plants, and waking up to ambient sounds produced by the creatures of the jungle. To clinch the matter, Sita even threatened Rama with dire consequences to herself if he did not let her go with him to the forest. Rama gave in, as he did with Lakshmana, who argued that his place was beside his brother at all points of time, no matter where he went.</p>
			<p>In preparation for their forest sojourn, Rama and Sita distributed abundant gifts and wealth to the sages and priests of Ayodhya. Then, along with Lakshmana, they went to take leave of Dasharatha and seek his blessings.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Ayodhya was rife with surmises when its people heard of Rama’s exile and Bharata replacing him as prince regent. A pall of gloom descended upon the city. Groups of people gathered in its streets, expressing shock and displeasure at the sudden turn of events. They cast aspersions on Dasharatha and questioned his motives. As Rama and Sita proceeded towards the king’s chamber, many of these comments fell on their ears but Rama ignored them. He remained calm and undisturbed unlike Lakshmana who was livid with rage.</p>
			<p>Sumantra ushered Rama, Lakshmana and Sita into Dasharatha’s chamber. As desired by the king, his queens were also present there. The emperor reproached himself before Rama for succumbing to Kaikeyi’s unfair demands. He begged Rama to ignore the vow that Kaikeyi had cunningly extracted from him. However, no amount of coaxing or cajoling deterred Rama from his stance. As Dasharatha embraced his son and wished him well, he fell down unconscious from the grief that pierced his heart like a thousand arrows. All those present, wept uncontrollably as Rama exited from the king’s chamber.</p>
			<p>Sumantra, Dasharatha’s most trusted minister and companion, let loose a volley of unforgiving words upon Kaikeyi. He hoped this would make her change her mind and she would relax her stand on Rama going to the forest. Sumantra admonished Kaikeyi for her dastardly deed and accused her of leading her husband and Ayodhya to doom. The loyal minister, without any reservations, vented his wrath on Kaikeyi. He told her that all the scholars and learned men of Ayodhya would rather follow Rama to the forest than be ruled by the son of a wicked woman.</p>
			<p>Sumantra taunted Kaikeyi for following in the vile footsteps of her mother who, even at the cost of her husband’s life, was intent on having her whims satisfied! In the presence of those assembled, Sumantra recalled an event that had taken place years ago. Ashwapati, the King of Kekeya and father of Kaikeyi, was granted a boon that allowed him to understand the language of birds and animals. The boon, however, was accompanied by a warning that he would lose his life if he divulged the animals’ conversations to anybody. One day when Ashwapati and his queen had retired to bed, the king guffawed loudly on hearing the shrill cry of a distant bird. When Kaikeyi’s mother desired to know the reason for the king’s laughter, Ashwapati informed her that he would be dead upon revealing the bird’s words. The queen was still insistent. The wise king who did not give in to his wife’s unreasonable demand, banished her to her parental home.</p>
			<p>When Sumantra finished narrating this incident, he begged Kaikeyi, Oh, royal lady, do not bring such disaster upon the righteous Dasharatha and his beloved Rama. Neither of them will go back on the word given to you! Take back your boons and save Ayodhya from calamity.”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi remained impervious to Sumantra’s entreaties as she had to others. When all good counsel had come to naught, Dasharatha, with a heavy heart asked Sumantra to get the chariot ready to take Rama to the forest. He also told him to assemble a complete army of soldiers, elephants, horses and wealth of every kind to take care of the needs of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita during their stay in the jungles. Hearing the king’s instructions to Sumantra, an enraged Kaikeyi flared: “Would you dare give Bharata the kingdom stripped of all its wealth?”</p>
			<p>Rama immediately intervened and declined to take anything of value with him, except garments of bark as befitting forest dwellers. He declared, “When I have renounced the kingdom to lead the life of an ascetic in the forest, what use would I have for all these riches?”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi, upon hearing Rama’s words, without compunctions, shamelessly handed to the three of them, attires of bark. The queen who had suddenly become heartless, made sure they wore these clothes in preparation for their departure. As the assembly of people gathered in the gynaeceum watched Sita struggle to get into the clothes of bark and Rama help her, they were driven to tears. They were distressed upon seeing their beloved Sita clad in the clothes of a hermitess. They pleaded with her to stay back in Ayodhya. They spoke with disdain of Kaikeyi’s villainy and shot hateful glances at her.</p>
			<p>Sage Vasishta who had hitherto been silent, was immensely moved by Sita’s plight, and condemned Kaikeyi’s behaviour. He chided her for having tricked Dasharatha into making the promise and having brought disgrace to the Ikshvaku family. He warned her that if Sita accompanied Rama to the forest, all of Ayodhya, including Bharata would follow them. He reiterated that Bharata being an honourable prince he would neither comply with his mother’s devious desire, nor accept to be coronated in place of Rama.</p>
			<p>Paying due respects to the peerless Vasishta, Sita however stood firm in her resolve of accompanying Rama to the forest.</p>
			<p>In a voice that reflected his anguish and anger, Vasishta addressed Kaikeyi, “Since it was Rama alone you asked to be exiled, take back from Sita the bark garments you’ve handed her. As your daughter-in-law, she deserves to be richly decked in silken robes and ornaments. She is of her own accord accompanying Rama. She will go to the forest, with all accessories as befitting her stature!”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha experienced insufferable angst as Rama, Lakshmana and Sita prepared to embark on their journey. He ruminated sorrowfully on the sin he must have committed in his earlier birth to beget the present misery. In concurrence with Vasishta’s comments, he insisted Sita be given all riches to see her through the rigours of forest life.</p>
			<p>The three of them took leave of Dasaratha and the queen mothers, after taking their blessings. Rama grieved only at having to leave his ageing parents in the dusk of their lives. Sumitra advised her beloved son Lakshmana to remain unwavering on the path of dharma. She advised him to look upon Rama and Sita as his parents and take care of them.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama leaves for the forest</h2>
			<p>As the chariot began to move with the threesome seated in it, the citizens of Ayodhya followed, wailing loudly and begging Rama not to go. Dasharatha, Kausalya and Sumitra, tears flowing down their cheeks, stood stunned, rooted to the spot where Rama had sought their blessings. They were still in a state of daze, unable to believe what they were witnessing. Meanwhile the crowd that followed Rama’s chariot beseeched Sumantra to ride slow so that they could drink in the splendorous beauty of their Rama for as long as they could.</p>
			<p>A dark veil of sadness and tragedy cloaked Ayodhya in its embrace. Whispers berating Dasaratha and his spineless attitude in the face of Kaikeyi’s wickedness, were no longer hushed.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha was overcome by remorse and became resentful of Kaikeyi. He addressed her, “Oh sinful lady, I curse myself for having wed you, charmed by your beauty. You are no longer my wife. I hereby disown you and will have nothing to do with anyone who associates with you. Should Bharata abide by your evil design and covet the throne of Ayodhya, let him not offer oblations to me after I’m gone from this world.” After venting his anger in this manner, Dasharatha refused to stay a moment longer in Kaikeyi’s mansion. He asked to be taken to the palace of Kausalya, mother of his darling Rama.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha continued to be restless and in delirium. His vision seemed to blank out after he himself had sent away the light of his life, Rama. He sought solace in taking Kausalya’s hand. Kausalya herself was in an agitated and tortured state, having been parted from her dear son. She wondered how her Rama who had never experienced pain or suffering of any kind, would live in the jungle among wild beasts and demons of most horrible nature. She could not imagine the delicate and dainty Sita facing the hardships of jungle existence, living like a homeless wanderer. Kausalya, to whom these thoughts were unbearable, mourned her fate. She said, “I am sure to have separated a cow from its calf in my previous birth. Why else would I be so afflicted in this life?”</p>
			<p>Sumitra, who was committed to righteousness, lauded Kausalya for having given birth to a son as noble and divine as Rama. She consoled her saying, “There is none more virtuous than Rama who is adored by one and all. Look at the compassionate Lakshmana who is so steadfast in his loyalty to Rama! And Sita, a noble soul of royal heritage, truly stands by her husband, sharing his adversity when she could have enjoyed a life of comfort here! Are the three of them, individuals to be pitied and lamented over? Noble Kausalya, cherish them, for they bring undying fame to the Ikshvaku Dynasty. A mother, whose son is Rama, should have no cause for grief.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama halts on the banks of the Tamasa</h2>
			<p>When Rama observed several elderly people of Ayodhya following their chariot, he alighted from it, and walked, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana. It was twilight when they reached the banks of the Tamasa River. The men who followed from Ayodhya slept under the trees on the river bank. Lakshmana and Sumantra prepared a bed of leaves for Rama and Sita to rest upon, while they themselves kept guard through the night.</p>
			<p>Rama woke up much before sunrise. Those who had followed Rama, fatigued by the previous day’s journey, were in deep slumber. Seeing this as the opportune moment to stop them from following him, Rama asked Sumantra to drive the three of them across the Tamasa. He also suggested that Sumantra negotiate turns of the chariot in a manner that would make these people believe Rama had gone back to Ayodhya. Rama’s plan worked. While he crossed the Tamasa with Lakshmana and Sita, the citizens of Ayodhya returned to their city.</p>
			<p>Ayodhya, the city of joy, was now submerged in sorrow. It looked forlorn, shorn of all beauty. The animosity towards Kaikeyi was distinctly discernible amongst the people. “How can we live in this city without our dear Rama? What work do we have in a place where the sinful Kaikeyi holds sway? Has she not brought ruin upon her husband and a virtuous son like Rama, who are both revered for their sterling qualities?” Such were the ramblings throughout Ayodhya.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama meets Guha</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, Rama journeyed past various territories of Kosala. Wherever he went, he heard villagers scoff at Dasharatha for buckling under pressure from his vile queen and delivering a boon so completely unfair. Rama walked on, unmindful of these comments. The threesome crossed the borders of Kosala to come upon a kingdom fed by the sacred Ganga. The river snaked its way, hugged by several hill ranges and verdant gardens that were divinely magnificent. The crystal blue waters of the Ganga was adorned with wading ducks, cranes and graceful swans. These aquatic birds flapped their wings rhythmically to the gentle flow of the river, creating their own mellifluous symphony as they caused ripples in its waters. Lotuses, lilies, hyacinths and a host of other flowers carpeted the river in places, even as marine creatures swam in gay abandon.</p>
			<p>Rama halted on the banks of the Ganga under the flower-laden Ingudi tree. They were in a principality that was ruled by the tribal chief Guha, a dear friend of Rama. Guha who heard about Rama’s arrival in his land, rushed to see him and extended all hospitality to the royals. He had a feast prepared for them which Rama politely declined. He favoured a simple meal of fruits and roots as appropriate for ascetics practicing austerities. As night fell, Lakshmana, Sumantra and Guha kept watch while Rama and Sita slept peacefully. Lakshmana spent the night relating to Guha, the events leading up to Rama’s exile.</p>
			<p>Rama rose early and prepared to travel deeper into the forest after crossing the Ganga. As he made to leave with Lakshmana and Sita in the boat that Guha had got ready, he asked Sumantra to return to Ayodhya. Sumantra turned bleary eyed at having to part from Rama. He expressed dismay at having to henceforth live in a kingdom largely controlled by Kaikeyi who had become vicious and evil. Rama, however, beseeched Sumantra to take care of his father and all his mothers, treating them with equal respect during his absence.</p>
			<p>Sumantra was woeful and pleaded with Rama, “How do I return without you, with an empty chariot to Ayodhya? Allow me Rama, to ride the chariot for you and accompany you on this forest sojourn as your constant companion along with Lakshmana and Sita.”</p>
			<p>Rama responded, “Sumantra, the Ikshvakus have had no greater friend than you. My father needs you now more than anyone else. Impress upon the grieving king and my mother that we are not perturbed or unhappy at having to live in the forest. It is important that you return to Ayodhya and tell mother Kaikeyi to rest assured that I indeed, dwell now in the forest! Without any fears, let her peacefully install her son, and my noble brother, Bharata as prince regent. In this manner the honour of my good father will be vindicated.”</p>
			<p>Rama took leave of Guha and Sumantra and set sail across the Ganga. Since leaving Ayodhya, it was the first night that the threesome spent all by themselves, in Vatsa, the region between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. As night drew its dark shroud around them, they retired to bed with heavy hearts. Rama became restless and despaired over his father’s angst. He worried that Dasharatha would not survive the catastrophe that had struck him. He feared that his mothers Kausalya and Sumitra would be persecuted by the ruthless Kaikeyi. Rama voiced all these fears to Lakshmana and asked him to return to Ayodhya to save their mothers from Kaikeyi who had become despicable. Rama stewed in self-recrimination, and rued that he was of no use as a son to his mother, the vulnerable Kausalya.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana consoled Rama but remained firm on not returning to Ayodhya. “Today I do not wish to be in the company of anyone, not even father, mother or our younger brothers. For that matter I do not even aspire to see heaven without you, dear brother!” With finality in his tone, Lakshmana sealed the subject of being parted from Rama.</p>
			<p>With the break of dawn, the trio resumed their journey through the forests. Towards sunset they reached the hermitage of Bharadwaja in the region of the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna. The sage who was aware of Rama’s banishment from Ayodhya, welcomed them cordially. He played the hospitable host, and made certain that they were suitably fed and well rested. The threesome heeded Bharadwaja’s advice and left for Chitrakoota the next day after seeking the sage’s blessings. Before their departure from his ashram, the kindly seer, with the warmth and concern of a father, performed religious rites to ensure their safe onward journey.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">To Chitrakoota</h2>
			<p>Sita was in raptures as they walked towards Chitrakoota hill which was a carpet of emerald. It was replete with tall trees, dense with foliage in various shades of green. They dripped blossoms in medley hues and bowed down humbly towards Mother Earth, laden with juicy fruits. The twittering of birds and call of crickets was music to the travelers who basked in nature’s glory without feeling the tedium of walking on thorny pathways. Rama, enamoured of the enchanting environs of Chitrakoota, decided to make this place their home. He had Lakshmana build them a hut. In no time, Lakshmana erected a cozy cottage made from leaves and logs obtained from the forest.</p>
			<p>Sumantra learned from Guha that Dasharatha’s sons and Sita, had made Chitrakoota their home. Since his mind was put to rest on receiving these tidings, he returned to Ayodhya. The residents of Ayodhya, still melancholic from the recent happenings, wailed when they noticed Sumantra return without their Rama. Even Nature in the city seemed to be in bereavement. Water bodies had cried themselves dry; plants and trees shed their green drape and looked withered. Birds and beasts no longer made ambient sounds and the forests around the Kosala capital were plunged in deathly silence.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ayodhya plunged in grief</h2>
			<p>Ayodhya was in the grip of an unnatural and disquieting calm as Sumantra entered its gates. He directly proceeded to the king’s palace to deliver Rama’s message to Dasharatha and his wives. The king had many questions for Sumantra. He wanted to know how his beloved child was adjusting to forest life, how the dainty and graceful Sita who was used to royal life walked the jungle path of bramble and bushes, how they slept, what they ate. The questions were as endless as the copious tears that gushed down from his now, ever-moist eyes.</p>
			<p>When Sumantra conveyed Rama’s message to him, Dasharatha was overcome with more grief. He rued his lack of prudence in granting Kaikeyi the boons. He deplored his recklessness in not having consulted his ministers and well-wishers before sending Rama away. Kausalya who was just as devastated, fainted as Sumantra communicated the sentiments Rama had expressed for his parents. Both, Dasharatha and Kausalya repeatedly begged Sumantra to take them to see Rama in the forest.</p>
			<p>Kausalya, unable to bear separation from Rama, taunted Dasharath for the misery he had brought upon them. “Oh king, you who are known for your compassion and kindness, did you not stop to think for a moment, the dire suffering your sons and the young Sita will face in the jungle? A woman’s husband and sons are her prime pillars of support, and you have mercilessly robbed me of both, in my old age. How can I lean on you when you are completely under Kaikeyi’s spell? My son, my Rama in whom I would find solace, you have driven him away to face a harsh life. Being wed to you, I cannot leave you to go and live with Rama in the forest. You have so completely destroyed me. You have not only ruined me, but also Ayodhya, and entire Kosala!”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha winced at Kausalya’s sharp words. Their sting was worse than even the sharpest of weapons. Dasharatha thought to himself: Is it not true that one reaps the fruits of one’s own actions, good or bad? Had he not caused unendurable pain to old and infirm parents when he was young? Dasharatha was haunted by the memory of an incident that had occurred when he was prince regent. He unburdened himself to Kausalya as he felt weighed down by it.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Old curse come true</h2>
			<p>Dasharatha had always been a skilful hunter. He could take aim with his bow at a beast merely by identifying the direction from which sounds emerged, without actually sighting the animal. Once he went out hunting towards the banks of the Sarayu, on a dark night after rains had lashed the forest. The jungle was completely silent. Dasharatha waited for the animals to come out to drink water. Soon he heard a gurgling sound. He believed it to be a creature drinking water. He took aim and hit his target. He was shocked and dismayed when he heard a human voice scream in pain. “Who can be my enemy? Why does he wish to kill me? How will I take this pitcher of water to my old and blind parents? How will they bear to hear of my death?”</p>
			<p>Hearing this piteous wail, Dasharatha immediately ran in the direction of the voice. He was appalled to see a young ascetic lying in a pool of blood, pierced by the arrow he had shot.</p>
			<p>“I am Shravan Kumar,” the young boy revealed to Dasharatha. “I live here with my blind parents. Oh prince, guardian and protector of people, you have caused me grievous injury. I came here to fill water for my aged parents who are thirsty. They would be waiting for me in our ashram. Please give them this pitcher.”</p>
			<p>Dasaratha was filled with remorse for his hasty and careless action. He slumped down beside Shravan Kumar and begged his forgiveness.</p>
			<p>“Please remove this arrow from my body and relieve me of the throbbing ache I feel. Inform my parents of my death at your hands,” Shravan Kumar pleaded as he lay bleeding and in intense pain.</p>
			<p>The young prince gently pulled the arrow out. Shravan Kumar breathed his last.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha was overcome by sorrow and guilt at what he had done. As directed by the dying youngster, he went to the ashram and gave Shravan’s parents the water. He confessed his deed to them. The old couple was inconsolable and saddened at their young son’s untimely and unnatural death.</p>
			<p>“Take us to the spot where our son lies cold,” they told Dasharatha.</p>
			<p>The mortified prince escorted them to the riverside. The pair cried over Shravan’s body, blessed him and performed his last rites. “You too will endure grief after being parted from your son in your old age. You will experience the anguish you have now caused us!” Shravan Kumar’s parents cursed Dasharatha with these words before they departed from this world.</p>
			<p>“Kausalya, my sin has followed me today. It is killing me now. It is the curse of that blind old couple that has brought this unbearable grief upon me.” Dasharatha sobbed, as he related this past event to his wife.</p>
			<p>Reminiscing the episode did not relieve the roller-coaster of emotions that Dasharatha was now experiencing - guilt, intense pain and torment. He felt completely shattered, heartbroken and disconsolate. He mumbled to himself, incoherent, incongruous words, as one demented. He called out “Oh Rama, Oh Lakshmana, Oh Sita …” Night fell and at some time in its dark hours, life ebbed out of the great Ikshvaku king.</p>
			<p>The people of Ayodhya woke up to a gloomy dawn. Dasharatha was gone. The kingdom was without a ruler.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Bharata’s dreams</h2>
			<p>Dasharatha’s body was duly preserved in a trough of oil for his sons to perform his last rites. Sage Vashishta sent word for Bharata and Shatrugna to return to Ayodhya from Kekaya. He instructed the messengers not to convey the news of Dasharatha’s demise to the brothers. He also advised them against referring to the recent events in Ayodhya leading to Rama’s exile.</p>
			<p>At Kekaya, meanwhile, Bharata woke up in cold sweat from a nightmare he had in the wee hours of the morning. The visions that he had seen were foreboding. He dreamt of his father falling off a mountain peak. He beheld in his dream, several other sights that seemed to warn him of impending disaster.</p>
			<p>Bharata’s apprehensions gathered volume when he saw men from Ayodhya approaching Rajagriha. As soon as they entered the king’s court and handed over the presents from Ayodhya, Bharata anxiously enquired after the welfare of each member of his family. Bharata who was only too familiar with his mother’s nature, asked after her welfare in the following words: “How is my mother Kaikeyi, of headstrong disposition and violent temperament, who is ever bent on having her whims and fancies satisfied?” The messengers answered Bharata’s questions, respectfully, without divulging, even in small measure, the haps in Ayodhya. They then asked him to immediately return to their capital, to dispense with urgent work there.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-2.11">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Bharata returns to Ayodhya</h2>
			<p>Bharata and Shatrugna took leave of their uncle and speedily returned to Ayodhya. Bharata felt very uneasy as he approached the city. The air seemed heavy with sadness. He did not see the characteristic mirthful crowd on its streets. As he entered the city through its Victory Gate, he noticed the mournful look on people’s faces.</p>
			<p>“Why Shatrugna, do our people appear so silent and sad? The musical instruments are not playing! Ayodhya seems to be rid of all joy; nothing looks as it should. I am worried that some misfortune has befallen our kingdom,” Bharata expressed his anxiety to his brother.</p>
			<p>Bharata saw signs of calamity everywhere. He was unable to contain himself. As soon as the chariot stopped at Dasharatha’s palace, he rushed in to meet his father. He became more nervous when he did not see the king in his chamber. He immediately hurried to his mother’s palace.</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi greeted Bharata with great joy. She hugged him and said, “Oh worthy son, I hope you had a comfortable journey? How are your uncle and grandfather? What news have you brought for me from my parental home?”</p>
			<p>Though Bharata was impatient to see his father and learn of his wellbeing, he patiently answered Kaikeyi’s barrage of questions. “Everyone is well there, mother. But why is father not to be seen anywhere? The couch upon which he so regally sits, is vacant now! His attendants seem so devoid of their usual gaiety. I must see father now and pay my respects to him,” Bharata said. His voice reflected the anxiety and trepidation he felt.</p>
			<p>Bharata felt the world crash upon him when Kaikeyi informed him of Dasharatha’s demise. He looked at his father’s empty bed and broke down, uncontrollable tears streaming down his face.</p>
			<p>As Bharata fell on his knees and grieved for his father, Kaikeyi, a picture of nonchalance, spoke to her son, “The kingdom of Ayodhya is now yours to rule! It is not becoming of a king to mourn in this manner. Get up, my son and prepare yourself to accept the glory that is coming your way. You should uphold dharma and follow in the steps of your father and forefathers.”</p>
			<p>Bharata was now acquainted with all that had transpired in Ayodhya during his absence. He was stunned at the monstrosity of his mother’s deed. When he recovered from the state of shock, he was filled with sadness and anger. He exploded at Kaikeyi, livid with rage,</p>
			<p>“I am ashamed to call you my mother. You have caused my father’s death. You have sinned by sending my most pious and noble brother to the forest. How could you even think of acting in such a despicable manner? Did Rama not always love you and respect you like his own mother? How could you entertain such heinous thoughts for one, who the whole world loves and admires, for one so full of virtues? Do you not know that I love Rama and look upon him as a father? How could you ever imagine that I would be happy robbing him of the kingdom that justly belongs to him? How could you believe that I would have enthroned myself upon my father’s grave and enjoy a seat that has been usurped from my brother? Mother, you have paid a very heavy price for a throne that I would not ever bother to covet. I would be eternally happy to serve Rama, as my father and king. You have rendered me fatherless, made widows of mothers Kausalya and Sumitra and orphaned the glorious Kingdom of Kosala by killing its ruler. You, whom I loathe to call my mother, are a curse on my very existence. You have indeed brought ignominy upon me. How do I wash this sin committed by you, off myself?”</p>
			<p>Kaikeyi was unperturbed by her son’s outburst. She justified her actions. Bharata, however, made it amply clear to her that he would not be party to her evil designs. A single thought was all-pervasive in his mind. He wanted to beg Rama for his forgiveness and bring him back to Ayodhya. He wished to restore to him the throne of Ayodhya which was rightfully his.</p>
			<p>Bharata strode out of Kaikeyi’s chamber, seething with, sorrow and shame. Along with Shatrugna, he went to meet mother Kausalya in her palace. Kausalya, whose mental faculties were clouded by deep grief, lambasted Bharata with scathing remarks as he approached her. She accused him of perpetrating the tragedy that had befallen her. With sarcasm-laden words, she asked him to ascend the throne that he desired.</p>
			<p>Kausalya’s sharp words stung Bharata. He fell at her feet and sobbed like a child, denying all knowledge of his mother’s dishonourable intentions. Bharata sought to convince Kausalya of his innocence. He assured her he had no role to play in the plot that his mother had hatched. He said, “Mother, if indeed I have sinned, let me suffer the consequences. But what greater punishment could I beget than what I already endure! I have lost my dear father to death; my brother Rama, who I cherish as a father, has been banished. Ayodhya and the world would despise me and hold me accountable for the tragedy that is upon us!”</p>
			<p>Kausalya was moved to tears by Bharata’s earnest words. She was convinced of the purity of his heart and honesty. Kausalya felt remorse for her verbal attack on him. She gathered him in her arms as she would a child, and consoled him.</p>
			<p>Bharata took leave of Kausalya. He informed her of his decision to seek Rama out in the forest and bring him back to be crowned king of Ayodhya.</p>
			<p>Bharata, under the guidance of Vasishta, completed the funeral rites of his father. Though he was impatient to seek out Rama and get him to return to Ayodhya, he had to await the conclusion of the thirteen-day mourning period. He completed all ceremonial precepts for the departed king in keeping with scriptural prescriptions. Once the obsequies were discharged, Dasharatha’s ministers requested Bharata to assume the throne of Ayodhya. They impressed upon him, that an empire without a ruler would always face the threat of invasion by enemies. Bharata declined all entreaties. He did not relent even at Vasishta’s instance that he should assume office of king. He stood firm by his words that Rama alone was the lawful claimant to the kingship of Ayodhya. Bharata compared Rama to the two most illustrious kings of the solar dynasty – Dileepa and Nahusha. He emphasized that Rama alone was worthy of being king. The nobles, ministers, learned men and people of Ayodhya hailed Bharata and lauded the nobility inherent in him.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, Shatrugna reflected on the happenings at Ayodhya when they were away at Keykaya. He wondered at the chain of catastrophic events let loose by the urgings and evil counsel of one woman – Manthara. He was puzzled that even the straight-talking Lakshmana could not prevail upon their father to desist from banishing Rama from the kingdom. An avalanche of razor-sharp words tumbled out from Shatrugna’s mouth when he spotted Manthara amidst other maids, bedecked in all finery. With the ferocity of a wild beast, he dragged Manthara by her hair and whirled her around in anger. Kaikeyi who witnessed this scene, surmised that she might be Shatrugna’s next target. She fled from there to protect herself from his wrath.</p>
			<p>Bharata calmed Shatrugna and told him that he himself would have slayed Kaikeyi, but for Rama. He said, “Forgive her, brother. Do you think Rama would ever pardon us or speak to us if we killed Kaikeyi or even this hunchback! Let us, without further delay, depart to the forest to bring back Rama.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Bharata’s love for Rama</h2>
			<p>Sumantra had got the chariots ready for the journey. Bharata left for the forest with a large retinue, comprising the people of Ayodhya, the queen mothers and an army of soldiers, chariots, horses and elephants. Her son’s verbal arrows finally brought Kaikeyi to her senses. She too joined Bharata’s convoy to bring back Rama.</p>
			<p>As dusk was drawing close, the procession reached Guha’s principality on the bank of the Ganga. Guha, who saw Bharata approach his region with a huge army, anticipated trouble. He suspected Bharata’s intentions and presumed he was here to harm Rama. Guha asked his guards to remain vigilant and watch Bharata’s moves. He took further precautions to ensure all defense measures were in place should Bharata attack his territory. Guha then proceeded to meet Bharata, taking with him fruits and sweets to offer to the prince.</p>
			<p>Sumantra who observed Guha coming towards them with a large group of attendants, acquainted Bharata with the chieftain’s friendship with Rama. He also recounted to Bharata, the great warmth and affection that Guha had showered upon Rama when they had halted a night in his land. Bharata was overjoyed to hear Sumantra’s words and now yearned, more than ever, to meet Guha. Once pleasantries were exchanged, Guha described to Bharata the interactions he had with Rama and Lakshmana during their very brief stay at his place. He eulogized Lakshmana’s reverence towards Rama and the extreme devotion and love he had for him. He told Bharata about the night-long vigil that Lakshmana had kept over Rama and Sita while they peacefully slept. Guha expressed his distress on seeing the princely Rama and Lakshmana wear garments of bark and sport matted locks like ascetics. With moist eyes, Guha told Bharata, “Sons of Dasharatha who were accustomed to silken couches, had slept under trees, on hard ground upon beds made of grass and leaves.”</p>
			<p>Bharata felt deep anguish and was driven to tears as Guha described the plight of his dear brothers and Sita. He felt himself responsible for their state of deprivation. He rued his misfortune in not being able to serve Rama, and admired Lakshmana and Sita for standing by him in his adversity. Bharata instantly decided that he too would henceforth, sleep on a bed of leaves and have his tresses matted like hermits. He desired to serve the exile in place of Rama and thereby honour the promise made by his father to Kaikeyi. He wished to see Rama return to Ayodhya and take on the reins of sovereignty.</p>
			<p>As twilight merged into night, Bharata slept at the very spot on the banks of the Ganga where Rama had rested. At the break of dawn, with the help of Guha’s men, Bharata and his procession crossed the river to sage Bharadwaja’s ashram. They took directions from the seer and continued on their way to Chitrakoota to see Rama.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-2.13">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Brothers meet </h2>
			<p>At Chitrakoota, Sita and Rama enjoyed the bounty of Nature in the midst of which they lived. As they sat soaking in the beauty of their surrounds, Rama observed a cloud of dust being raised at a distance. It was attended by a loud cacophony of sounds. He asked Lakshmana to ascertain the source of the clamour. When Lakshmana noticed the Kovinda tree, the ensign of Ayodhya, fluttering atop the chariots, he guessed that Bharata headed the convoy. Like Guha, he too suspected foul play by Bharata. He believed Bharata had followed Rama to the forest to ensure that he gained undisputed sovereignty of Ayodhya. Lakshmana was ready to fight him. He communicated his thoughts to Rama as he informed him of Bharata’s arrival at Chitrakoota with a vast army.</p>
			<p>Rama allayed Lakshmana’s fears saying, “Lakshmana, do not attribute such uncharitable thoughts to him. Do you not know our Bharata? He knows the way of dharma. It is not to fight or kill that he comes here. He is here to give me back the kingdom. One word from me, and Bharata would even give up his life for me!” said Rama.</p>
			<p>On hearing Rama’s words, Lakshmana cringed with shame for having entertained such ignoble thoughts of Bharata.</p>
			<p>While Rama and Lakshmana were engaged in conversation, Bharata, along with Shatrugna, Guha and Sumantra, approached their cottage. Bharata, who could no longer contain his anxiety and eagerness to meet Rama, had left his army behind, by the banks of the river. Rama came out from the cottage to meet his brother. When Bharata beheld Rama attired in the garb of a recluse, he broke down and fell at his feet, bathing them in a deluge of tears. He begged Rama’s forgiveness and asked him to return home and assume the throne of Ayodhya. “I stand condemned for this cruelty that my mother has wrought on you, Mother Sita and Lakshmana. Hell alone is the place for Kaikeyi on whose account we suffer this fate. Come back, noble brother and lift Ayodhya from doom.”</p>
			<p>Rama was happy to see Bharata. The brothers embraced one another, even as tears choked their voices and they were unable to articulate coherent words. Rama who was full of anxiety about their father, enquired about Dasharatha. Rama fainted on hearing of his demise. Copious tears streamed down his face when he recovered. Lakshmana and Sita were just as inconsolable. They took a dip in the river and offered oblation to the departed king. Rama, as a minstrel dwelling in the forest, could only offer the sacred water of the Mandakini, and balls made from the crushed pulp of the Ingudi fruit to the spirit of his late father.</p>
			<p>Soon, Vasishta arrived at Rama’s hut, accompanied by Dasharatha’s queens and the rest of their entourage. The queen mothers were happy to see their sons. At the same time, it was heart wrenching for them to behold the beautiful Sita bereft of royal trappings. If Kausalya was proud of Janaki’s steadfast loyalty to Rama, she was equally pained to see the daughter of Janaka suffer the rigours of forest life alongside her son.</p>
			<p>Bharata repeatedly implored Rama to return. He refused kingship of Ayodhya, citing appropriate reasons for doing so. “The throne is neither rightfully mine, nor do I possess your capabilities to rule the land,” he said. While he expressed disdain and resentment towards Kaikeyi for the villainy she had engaged in, Bharata did not spare the dead king either. “It is my adherence to morality and kshatriya dharma that prevents me from slaying my mother. I condemn her loathsome act and the dreadful wrong she has done you. I mourn the loss of father. Though I do not desire to speak ill of him, his infatuation for Kaikeyi has led him to his doom. He did not use the judiciousness of his office before banishing you from Ayodhya. He perpetrated a sinful deed only to please a woman. This is not in keeping with the piety, virtue and wisdom for which he was known and loved.”</p>
			<p>Rama tried to pacify Bharata, explaining that death is man’s constant companion that ever stalks him. He urged Bharata to stop grieving for Dasharatha who he said had ascended to heaven after having lived a full and virtuous life. Rama also revealed to him that Dasharatha had been compelled to crown Bharata prince regent because of the promise he had made to Ashwapati, the King of Kekaya at the time of his wedding to Kaikeyi. Rama refuted the aspersions Bharata cast on their father. He explained that the king was bound by his sense of gratitude to Kaikeyi. “Had she not saved him when he was critically injured during the encounter with the demons?” asked Rama. He countered every argument that Bharata laid before him. Rama asked his brother to return to Ayodhya and discharge his duty towards the kingdom and its people.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Bharata asks for Rama’s sandals</h2>
			<p>When Bharata failed to sway Rama from his stance with his arguments, he threatened fast unto death if his brother did not return home and assume kingship of Ayodhya. Even this did not move Rama to budge from his resolve. Bharata realized the futility of his efforts, and agreed to return to Ayodhya. He however, placed before Rama a pair of wooden sandals and asked him to step into them. He informed Rama that he would place the sacred pair on the throne of Ayodhya, as a symbol of Rama’s kingship. “I will reside in Nandigrama on the outskirts of Ayodhya and rule the land on your behalf till you return from exile.”</p>
			<p>Before leaving for Ayodhya, Bharata made a vow in the presence of all those gathered. “If Rama fails to return to Ayodhya on the appointed day upon completion of the fourteen years of exile, I will immolate myself.”</p>
			<p>In keeping with his word, when Bharata got back to Ayodhya, he placed Rama’s sandals on the throne. “Rama is our king,” he told its people. “He is away to honour the promise made by our father. He will return at the end of fourteen years and assume this throne which justly belongs to him. Until then, as his servant, I shall bear the responsibility of protecting you, the citizens of this kingdom.”</p>
			<p>Bharata stayed in Nandigrama and ruled the kingdom with the assistance of able ministers.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama leaves Chitrakoota </h2>
			<p>Rama began to be haunted by the memory of Bharata and his family at Chitrakoota. He felt nostalgic as he recalled their conversations and ached to be with them. He agonized at parting from them once again. He could not remain in Chitrakoota where the memories of his loved ones, rekindled his longing for them. He decided to seek another place in the forest and make it their home. Rama also remembered the promise he had made to the rishis who had fled from the vicinity of Chitrakoota. He had assured them that he would deal with the demons who were terrorizing them, and make the forest safe to live. Hence, along with Sita and Lakshmana, he left Chitrakoota. As they walked, they came upon the ashram of sage Atri and his wife Anasuya. The trio partook of sage Atri’s hospitality and upon his advise, moved on to Dandaka forest where they made their new home.</p>
