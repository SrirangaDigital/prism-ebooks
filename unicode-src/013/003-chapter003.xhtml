		<p>Rama, Lakshmana and Sita entered the depths of the Dandaka forest which was infested with wild animals. Here they were confronted by Viradha, a cannibal of enormous proportions. He pounced on Sita and claimed that he would make her his wife. While Rama wallowed in self-pity on seeing Viradha grabbed Sita, an angry Lakshmana geared himself to fight the ogre. In an earsplitting voice, Viradha asked to know the identity of the threesome. Viradha was in reality, Tumburu, a gandharva who had incurred the wrath of Kubera and was therefore transformed into a monstrous ogre. When Tumburu pleaded for mercy, Kubera told him that he would be liberated from his curse when he would meet Rama and be killed by him.</p>
		<p>A duel ensued between Viradha and the sons of Dasharatha. The brothers axed the rakshasa’s arms. They then dug a pit and buried Viradha in it. The demon was freed from his curse and felt fortunate in having met his end at Rama’s hands. However, before life ebbed out of him, Viradha cautioned Rama about the dangers lurking in Dandaka. He directed Rama to meet sage Sarabhanja.</p>
		<p>Sarabhanja had patiently waited for the auspicious moment when Rama would step into his hermitage. As destined, the sage shed his mortal coils upon seeing Rama, and ascended to heaven. As advised by Sarabhanja, Rama called on Sage Sutikshana who invited him to make his ashram their abode. Rama who had taken it upon himself to protect the rishis of the forest from the demons, politely declined Sutikshana’s offer and continued to roam the various areas of Dandaka.</p>
		<p>Sita, however, was apprehensive of Rama taking up weapons to vanquish the evil spirits in the forest. But Rama, who had vowed to help the sages, dispelled Sita’s fears. He reminded her that it was his duty as a kshatriya, to protect those who sought refuge in him.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama meets Agasthya </h2>
			<p>Rama visited sages in several ashrams in Dandaka. He now desired to meet the great sage Agasthya who lived deeper south in the forest. Agasthya was a very wise and learned seer who was renowned for his exceptional spiritual powers.</p>
			<p>“Sita, do you know how mighty sage Agasthya is? All the rishis went to Mount Kailash to attend the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. But sage Agasthya alone stayed in the south to maintain the balance of the earth!” Rama explained.</p>
			<p>“Once, the Vindhya Mountain grew so tall as to reach the skies. It threatened to block the movement of the sun. The gods sought the help of Agasthya,” Rama continued to recount Agasthya’s various feats, as Sita and Lakshmana listened to him in rapt attention.</p>
			<p>“Sage Agasthya then stood in front of the towering mountain which bowed before him in reverence. Agasthya blessed Vindhya with the words, “May you always remain in this form.” His words were prophetic. The mountain remained bowed, and stopped growing in height.</p>
			<p>On their way to Agasthya’s ashram, Rama, Lakshmana and Sita stopped for a while at his brother’s hermitage. Agasthya’s brother received them cordially and narrated to them the story of the rakshasa brothers Vatapi and Ilvala. The fearsome ogres who were capable of assuming any form, terrorized the rishis dwelling in Dandaka, and killed many of them. Ilvala would assume the form of a learned Sanskrit scholar and invite other erudite men to partake of ceremonial food. Ilvala would use his magical powers to transform Vatapi into a goat. He would then kill the goat, cook it and feed its meat to the unsuspecting seers. When the rishis had partaken of the meal, Ilvala would call out to Vatapi to come out. Vatapi would then emerge, tearing apart, the bodies of the sages. But Agasthya put an end to the demons. When the wicked Ilvala served him the meal, Agasthya consumed it saying, “Vatapi, be digested.” When Ilvala called out to his brother, there was no response as Vatapi had been digested by the rishi!</p>
			<p>Rama took leave of Agasthya’s brother after expressing gratitude for the warmth he accorded them. Agasthya’s sanctuary was enchanting with abounding greenery in the midst of which herds of spotted deer, danced. As the three of them stood lost in their surrounds, the sage came out to welcome them. When his guests had partaken of their meal, were well rested, and ready to leave, Agasthya blessed them and presented Rama with divine weapons. He advised them to spend the remaining years of their exile at Panchavati, a safe haven and place of charming beauty that Sita was sure to enjoy.</p>
			<p>Rama, along with his brother and consort, headed in the direction of Panchavati, as suggested by Agasthya. On their way they stumbled upon Jatayu, the giant vulture. Lakshmana mistook the creature to be an ogre in disguise. The aged and wise bird sensed Lakshmana’s apprehension. He approached the brothers and introduced himself as Dasharatha’s dear friend. He also told them that he and his sibling Sampati were the sons of Aruna, and the nephews of Garuda. The threesome were happy to find a friend in the forest.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Panchavati</h2>
			<p>As they walked the trail canopied by emerald trees, the tranquility of their environs was broken only by the shrill call of birds. Soon they reached Panchavati and were immediately struck by its sublime beauty. They had entered an enchanting world that was a vast palette in shades of green, intermingled with blossoms in motley colours.</p>
			<p>“Lakshmana, this place looks so wonderful. We are surrounded by hills that are so lush with trees,” said Rama, looking around.</p>
			<p>“Look at the sparkling blue waters of the gentle Godavari and the glistening white sands on its banks. Oh, look there, so many deer frolicking with joy!” enthused Sita. She was mesmerized by the acrobatics of the birds. They swooped down upon the lakes one moment, soared high and wheeled in circles through the sky the next moment. She was captivated by this avian drama that unfolded before her. She warmed to the ambient sounds produced by the creatures of the forest.</p>
			<p>“Lakshmana, why don’t you look for a suitable place and build us a little ashram here?” asked Rama.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana at once set about gathering material to construct their home. With great speed and deftness, he raised mud walls and covered the roof with thatch. They settled down to a cozy existence in their new dwelling.</p>
			<p>They spent ten happy years in the forest, living in harmony with nature.</p>
			<p>The woodland had plenty of ponds that were filled with red, pink, yellow and white lotuses. Their broad green leaves carpeted the water. To Sita, the flowers seemed to rise majestically above the muddy waters of the pond. As the rays of the sun fell gently on them, the lotuses slowly opened up and spread their petals in layers.</p>
			<p>Rama, Lakshmana and Sita enjoyed the jet sprays of water from the thundering waterfalls in the forest. The chirping and chatter of birds soothed their ears. Sita loved running after the nimble-footed deer in the woods and watch peacocks dance with their brilliantly-coloured feathers wide open.</p>
			<p>Seasons changed, each bringing with it, its unique beauty. The exiled members of Dasharatha’s family lived happily nestled in the lap of nature.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Soorpanaka</h2>
			<p>One day as the brothers and Sita were engaged in mirthful banter outside their ashram, a beautiful young woman approached them and addressed Rama. “Who are you? You look like an ascetic but carry weapons like a warrior.”</p>
			<p>Rama introduced himself, Sita and Lakshmana to the charming lady who then revealed her true identity to them.</p>
			<p>“I’m Soorpanaka, sister of Ravana, the Lord of Lanka. Two of my other brothers in Lanka, have distinguished themselves. While Kumbhakarna is known for his extraordinary strength, Vibhishana is renowned and respected for his wisdom. Khara is another of my brothers and he rules Janasthana region of Dandaka forest. Dooshana, one of my younger brothers, helps Khara.”</p>
			<p>Soorpanaka was struck by Rama’s effulgent beauty and overcome by passion and desired to make him her husband. Soorpanaka who looked ugly with her deformed eyes, crooked nose and enormous belly, was endowed with magical powers. She used this ability to transform herself into a beautiful woman to attract Rama.</p>
			<p>“Everyone in this forest is afraid of me. But the moment I set eyes on you, I fell in love with you,” she said, her voice filled with arrogance.</p>
			<p>Soorpanaka pointed towards Sita, and said, “Leave this chit of a girl and marry me. I am the one worthy of you!”</p>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana teased Soorpanaka, each pointing to the other as being more suited to be her groom. The demoness was enraged when the borthers poked fun at her. She charged ferociously at Sita and threatened to kill her. Lakshmana immediately rose to Sita’s defense. He pulled out his sword and chopped off Soorpanaka’s ears and nose! She howled wailed in pain as she regained her original form, and rushed out of Panchavati, blood oozing from her wounds. She burst in upon Khara’s court, feeling outraged and insulted.</p>
			<p>“Brother,” she thundered! “Look what the sons of Dasharatha have done to me! Go at once and kill them.”</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.4">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Khara and Dooshana annihilated</h2>
			<p>Khara initially sent some of his men to fight Rama and Lakshmana. Rama easily overpowered these ogres and killed them. Khara who was livid with fury, summoned Dooshana and along with a huge army, marched to Panchavati to fight Rama. His men, who were enthusiastic to see blood and gore, strode ahead, making deadly sounds and raising heroic slogans. Khara observed evil portents as he started out for battle. Rama on the other hand witnessed auspicious omens. He ensured Sita’s safety before he engaged in duel with Khara. He asked Lakshmana to escort her to a safer place.</p>
			<p>As the clash between the titans ensued, heavenly beings assembled in space to watch the scene with bated breath. They wondered how Rama would single-handedly tackle the demons.</p>
			<p>Khara’s men continuously bombarded arrows and darts at Rama. The prince defended them skillfully and killed most of the demons including Dooshana. When the battle raged fiercely, Rama used the divine bow given to him by Sage Agasthya. He broke Khara’s chariot with it. As Khara hurled his mace at Rama, the prince shattered it with his arrows. Soon Khara fell dead on the battlefield like the rest of his army.</p>
			<p>“Hail Rama! Hail the son of Dasharatha! He has killed the rakshasas and restored peace in Dandaka,” shouted the Devas, showering flowers on Rama.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.5">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Akampana reports to Ravana </h2>
			<p>Akampana, a demon who survived the battle, hurried to Lanka to report the debacle to Ravana. In the same breath in which he detailed the death of Khara, Dooshana, and their men, he extolled the indomitable might of Rama. Ravana bellowed when he heard Akampana praise Rama’s skills and strength in such glowing terms. “I will show that mere mortal, my supreme power. Akampana, you will then know who is invincible.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, lord of Lanka, you underestimate Rama’s power. When he is incensed by anger, he can cause floods, pick up the submerging earth, and cause the wind to cease. You cannot conquer Rama in battle or destroy him in any manner. But I do have an idea. Carry off his wife Sita, whose beauty defies all description. Without Sita, the love of his life, Rama will not survive.</p>
			<p>Akampana’s idea appealed to Ravana and he immediately took off on his aerial chariot to Panchavati. On the way he stopped to meet his maternal uncle Mareecha and seek his help in accomplishing his mission. He updated Mareecha on the fall of Janasthana and the death of Khara and his entire army. Ravana then conveyed to Mareecha that he would avenge the death of his brother by whisking Sita away and thereby cause Rama’s demise. On hearing Ravana’s plan, Mareecha advised him against the plot, saying that such an act would certainly bring about his own destruction.</p>
			<p>“Whoever counseled you to commit this vile deed is either misguided, or he does not have your wellbeing at heart. Be satisfied with keeping your wives happy and enjoying life with them. Leave Rama and his wife alone,” Mareecha advised.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.6">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Soorpanaka seeks revenge</h2>
			<p>Ravana heeded Mareecha’s counsel and abandoned the idea of abducting Sita. When he returned to Lanka, Soorpanaka rushed into his chamber with the ferocity of a tornado, causing those present, to tremble in fear. Her thirst for revenge against Rama escalated to monumental levels with the death of Khara. She now sought Ravana’s intervention to crush Rama. She recounted to her brother how Rama and Lakshmana had insulted her and disfigured her.</p>
			<p>“How can you sit here in peace when your land is threatened by two petty creatures from the mortal world?” Soorpanaka hollered at Ravana. “Avenge my defacement. Punish Rama for having slayed our brother Khara. Carry away that lovely Sita and make her your wife.” Soorpanaka cleverly manipulated Ravana and instigated him to achieve her own ends.</p>
			<p>Ravana could no longer contain his desire to possess Sita when he heard his sister describe her beauty in glowing terms. Once again he fell prey to imprudent advice. He succumbed to the temptation of abducting Sita. For a second time he approached Mareecha to help him kidnap Sita.</p>
			<p>Mareecha, who was fully aware of Rama’s supreme power, appealed to Ravana to desist from the dishonourable act. “In committing this unholy crime of coveting another man’s wife, you will gain nothing except death and damnation. Do not be the cause of your own downfall and that of your kingdom.” Mareecha enumerated the innumerable qualities of Rama whose power and prowess, he emphasized, were fathomless. “By indulging in this sinful act, you are playing with fire. Rama’s rage is bound to scorch you to ashes.”</p>
			<p>As if to lend credibility to his counsel, Mareecha recounted to Ravana his own experience of facing Rama. “When he was a mere lad, Rama bound me and threw me into the ocean when I tried to ruin a sacrifice that the great sage Vishwamitra was performing. On yet another occasion I escaped being killed by Rama when I was roaming the Dandaka forests in the guise of a large stag. When I saw him in Dandaka, I charged at him to kill him, seeking revenge for my defeat at his hands, years ago. By dint of my cunningness, I slipped away before I could be hit by his most powerful arrows. But the two ogre friends who accompanied me on that occasion were killed by Rama’s arrows. Since I have escaped death at his hands twice earlier, I no longer wish to confront him.”</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.7">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The golden deer</h2>
			<p>Ravana, however, remained adamant in pursuing his objective. Mareecha reluctantly gave in to his nephew’s whims. Ravana, meanwhile, had his plans well laid out, to the last detail, for Mareecha to follow.</p>
			<p>Ravana and Mareecha flew in the former’s golden chariot and reached Panchavati. Once there, they executed their plan. Mareecha turned himself into a wonderful golden deer and set off to draw Sita’s attention.</p>
			<p>The deer romped and gamboled around the dense trees surrounding Rama’s ashram. The silver spots on his golden body shone like twinkling stars. Sita was gathering flowers in the forest when she spotted the magical deer. She was bewitched by the dazzling splendour of this creature scampering before her.</p>
			<p>She called out to Rama and Lakshmana, “Come out and see this magnificent deer! What colour, what mischievous eyes it has. Look how playful it is. Bring it for me. We will rear it as our pet,” she begged of Rama.</p>
			<p>The ever alert Lakshmana suspected the deer to be a rakshasa in disguise, perhaps Mareecha who was known for assuming this form. He observed, “Has anyone ever heard of, or seen a real deer with such fancy looks, glittering in gold, silver and precious stones!”</p>
			<p>But Sita was so fascinated by the creature that she insisted on Rama fetching it for her. She expressed her desire to have the lovely golden skin of the deer if Rama was unable to bring the creature, alive to her. Rama who did not want to disappoint Sita, gave strict instructions to Lakshmana, not to leave her alone even for a moment while he went after the deer. The spotted creature frisked and frolicked, moving deeper into the jungle, far away from their ashram. Rama followed. When Rama grew tired of the chase, he shot an arrow at it. It pierced its heart and the creature collapsed.</p>
			<p>However, before falling down dead, Mareecha assumed his real form. As planned, he shouted, “Ah Sita, ah Lakshmana,” imitating Rama’s voice. Rama recalled Lakshmana’s astute observation about the deer being Mareecha in disguise when he heard the dying creature call out to Sita and Lakshmana in his voice. Fear gripped Rama. He was sure Sita would be agitated on hearing Mareecha’s words in Rama’s voice. He began to run towards their ashram.</p>
			<p>At the ashram, as soon as Sita heard Rama’s cry of distress, she panicked. She implored Lakshmana to go after his brother and rescue him from the danger that she thought he was in. Since Lakshmana had promised Rama that he would not leave Sita unguarded, he refused to budge. He comforted Sita by telling her that Rama who was unassailable, would come to no harm. But Sita who was gripped by fear, lost all reason. She refused to be pacified. Instead, she accused Lakshmana of having evil designs on her. She charged him of being a wolf in sheep’s guise, an enemy of Rama who feigned brotherly love for him. “Because of your greed to get me, you would allow Rama to die. Don’t you ever be deluded that I would even look at any man other than my Rama.”</p>
			<p>Sita’s words pierced Lakshmana’s heart. Sita who was extremely agitated, continued her invective against her brother-in-law and threatened dire consequences if he refused to go after Rama and save him.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana was no longer able to bear Sita’s barbed remarks. He was also fearful of her threats of ending her life if he refused to seek out Rama and help him. He left her unguarded, and went in search of Rama. An uneasy feeling niggled him as he left their hermitage. Lakshmana had a nasty premonition that he may not see Sita upon his return with Rama.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.8">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana in saffron robe</h2>
			<p>Ravana who had hid himself amidst the thick bushes watched the altercations between Sita and Lakshmana. As soon as he saw Lakshmana depart, leaving Sita alone, he executed his plan. Ravana attired himself in a saffron robe, and wore a garland of rudraksha around his neck. He disguised himself as an ascetic, and with staff and kamandala in hand, he approached Sita, chanting mantras.</p>
			<p>Sita most respectfully, offered him fruits. After making some idle conversation with her, Ravana made his real intentions known to her.</p>
			<p>“I have come to take you as my wife,” he said. “Come, let us go to my kingdom, Lanka.”</p>
			<p>Sita was shocked at his daring behaviour. She derided him with angry words. Ravana turned a deaf ear. Instead, he boasted of being unmatched in might and skills by anyone else in all the three worlds. Ravana who was infatuated with passion to possess her, grabbed Sita and set her on the chariot which then began to rise in the air. Sita cried out to Rama and Lakshmana for help.</p>
			<p>“Oh my lord, where are you? Here is this wicked rakshasa who has evil designs on me. Help, help! Oh faithful brother, Lakshmana, rescue me from this demon!”</p>
			<p>As Ravana’s aerial car rose higher and higher, Sita cried out to all of nature to help her. She called out to the trees and creatures of the Dandaka forest to inform Rama of the grave danger in which she was placed.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.9">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Jatayu fights Ravana</h2>
			<p>Just as the aerial car gained height Sita noticed old Jatayu perched on a tree top. She called out to him, asking him for help. Jatayu who had been asleep, woke up with her wails. He realized that she was in trouble when she called out the names of Rama and Lakshmana. Soon he spotted Ravana whisk her away in his vehicle. He immediately flew in front of the car and blocked its path.</p>
			<p>“Oh learned king, you are a protector of people. It is your duty to honour and protect all women. Are you not committing a grave sin by carrying Sita away?”</p>
			<p>When Jatayu realized that Ravana was in no mood to relent, he challenged him to a fight. “I am old and have no weapons to fight you. Yet I cannot stand by and watch you take Sita away. If you are not a coward, get off your chariot and face me!”</p>
			<p>A clash between the two giants began. Ravana hurled deadly darts at Jatayu. The eagle king tore Ravana’s flesh with his talons. He broke the demon’s chariot into several pieces and killed the mules harnessed to it. He fought like a true hero, but Ravana was too strong for the ageing warrior bird. He chopped off Jataayu’s wings and claws. The bird fell to the ground, grievously wounded.</p>
			<p>Sita who looked upon Jatayu as a father, cried in anguish at his plight.</p>
			<p>“Great king indeed, you are! How valiant you are, to steal another man’s wife in his absence! How courageous you are, to strike an old and unarmed bird! The world will certainly remember you for these shameful deeds!” Sita turned crimson with rage and volleyed these scornful words at Ravana.</p>
			<p>But the ten-headed king of ogres was unperturbed. He tightened his grip on her and soared in the air. He proceeded towards Lanka, flying over mountains and rivers. As Sita looked down she observed a group of vanaras sitting on a mountain peak. With quick presence of mind, she removed her sash and bundled some of her ornaments in it. She flung the package down hoping to draw the attention of the vanaras with it. She expected them to pick up the bundle and turn it over to Rama when he came looking for her. She believed it would serve as a clue to indicate the direction in which she was taken.</p>
			<p>As the chariot rode on in the sky, the Sun hid behind the horizon. The earth was plunged in darkness.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.10">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sita in Lanka</h2>
			<p>“This is Sita. Serve her as you would serve me,” Ravana ordered the rakshasis as soon as he reached Lanka and entrusted her to the care of the rakshasis. He then summoned eight of the most powerful ogres of Lanka and asked them to spy over Rama in Janasthana. The ogres assumed invisible forms and settled down in Janasthana to discharge the task given to them.</p>
			<p>Sita was in tears, overwhelmed with grief. “My lord, I firmly believe you will soon come to save me. It is this belief that consoles me and makes me feel bold to face this demon,” she said to herself.</p>
			<p>Ravana tried to entice Sita with all the gold, jewels and wealth in Lanka. Sita was unmoved and she fearlessly challenged Ravana. She placed a blade of grass between herself and Ravana while talking to him. “Do not entertain hopes of winning me. It is only a matter of time before Rama comes here to rescue me. You cannot escape the ruin you have brought upon yourself by committing this evil act.”</p>
			<p>Sita’s unyielding words infuriated Ravana. “I give you twelve months to decide your fate. Make your choice; either you willingly become my wife, or be prepared to get cooked as meat for my breakfast”, he warned Sita.</p>
			<p>He then turned to the rakshasis attending on Sita and ordered, “Leave her in Ashoka Vana. Break her pride and stubbornness. Make her see sense to accept me as her husband.”</p>
			<p>Ashoka Vana was a breathtaking garden attached to the women’s apartments in Ravana’s palace. It was verdant with trees, flowers and ornamental plants. Deer and peacocks romped freely in the garden. The park had some of the most exotic and colourful birds in the world. The avenues of green trees led to a huge lake with turquoise blue waters. The lagoon rippled with plops made by multicoloured fishes swimming in its glassy waters.</p>
			<p>Water lilies and lotuses blanketed the ponds in Ashoka Vana. Ducks and swans swam gracefully in them, enjoying the warm glow of the sun. Nature’s vibrant hues lifted Sita’s spirits. They appeared to reinforce her faith that her Rama would soon save her from the clutches of evil Ravana.</p>
			<p>At the same time that Sita was placed under the care of the rakshasis at Lanka, Brahma solicited Indra to visit her in Lanka. Since Sita refused any nourishment from the hands of the demon clan, he asked Indra to offer her a meal of milk, rice and sugar – food most appropriately offered to the sacred fire. Nidra the god of sleep accompanied Indra to Lanka in order to put the demons to deep slumber while Indra met and spoke to Sita.</p>
			<p>“I am Indra, come here at Brahma’s behest, to offer you food fit to be served as an oblation to the holy fire. Oh princess of Videha, do not starve from grief for having been placed in this land of demons. Kindly partake of this offering which will nourish and sustain you for years to come,” Indra pleaded with Sita when he met her in Ashoka Vana.</p>
			<p>Sita, who was wary of being deceived by the ogres time and again, and who was also familiar with the unique symbols and emblems associated with various gods, asked Indra to prove his identity. Indra did as asked. Sita was convinced of Indra’s identity. She paid respects to him as she would, her father. She then gladly accepted the offering made by him.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama goes in search of Sita</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, at Dandaka, Rama and Lakshmana realized that Mareecha in the guise of a golden deer, had tricked them. They rushed to their ashram, fearing for Sita. They were alarmed and upset to find her missing. They searched for her everywhere – amidst the dense forests, hills, mountains and river banks surrounding their abode.</p>
			<p>Rama wept in grief. He kept repeating, “What I feared has happened! I am sure the rakshasas have made meat of her! You should not have left Sita alone, Lakshmana.”</p>
			<p>Rama rushed in and out of their hut, looking for Sita in every nook and corner. He frantically ran here and there like a man possessed, asking the trees, the shrubs, the streams, the hills and creatures of the forest, if they had seen his beloved Sita. Fear swelled by the minute when he found no signs of Sita. Tormented by grief, he broke down in uncontrollable sobs. He threatened to dry up the rivers, render birds wingless and incapable of flight, annihilate the world and wipe out the demon race from it.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana felt pained on seeing Rama so distraught. He tried to console and comfort him. He reminded Rama of his innately composed nature and remarked that he was allowing sorrow and anger to cloud his thinking. For a short while, Lakshmana’s composure seemed to act as ballast to Rama’s unstable sensibilities. Rama seesawed between hope and despair, going through a roller coaster of contrasting emotions.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana sought to awaken the sleeping stoic in Rama and inspire him with courage. “Misery is but a passing cloud and who, born in this world is free from it? Rama, we are mere mortals. Even the likes of Indra, Vasishta and Yayati have not been spared from sorrow. Even the gods and celestial beings cannot escape fate. No one, absolutely no one, is immune from pain. Take heart, dear brother and do not give way to depression. Let us seek out the fiend who has brought this misery upon us.”</p>
			<p>The brothers intensified their search for Sita in Janasthana. As they ventured deeper into the forest, they spotted scattered flowers and golden beads which Rama identified as belonging to Sita. They followed the trail and came upon a spot where they saw signs of a recent scuffle. Moving close, they observed blood stains, crushed armour, smashed fragments of a chariot, royal headgear, broken jewels and such other material. They then noticed Jatayu lying in a pool of blood. Initially Rama mistook the bird for a demon in disguise, one who had devoured Sita. He rushed forward to kill the bird. Jatayu then informed Rama of the misfortune that had befallen Sita. “Ravana, the King of Lanka has carried off your dear wife. I tried to stop him. I battled with him and broke his chariot. But he was too strong for me. He cut off my wings and legs. I am on the verge of death. My love for you has enabled me to hold on to my breath so that I could inform you of Sita’s fate. Bless me Rama, so that I may die in peace.”</p>
			<p>Tears welled up in Rama’s eyes as he embraced the dying bird. Dasharatha’s son once again wallowed in self-pity. “I lost my kingdom, have been banished from my land, I lost my father and could not even perform duly his last rites. My wife has disappeared and I have no clue to her whereabouts, and now I have lost Jatayu, a loving ally who was like a father to me. Could anyone be more unlucky than I am?”</p>
			<p>After performing Jatayu’s last rites and laying him to rest, Rama and Lakshmana continued their search for Sita.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-3.12">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kabanda directs Rama to Sugreeva </h2>
			<p>As they wandered into the deep bowels of the forest and wondered where to look for Sita, an ugly and gigantic form suddenly appeared before them. He was a demon with no head or feet. His mouth was on his pot-like belly and the only eye he had was located on his chest! He had two enormous hands with which he grabbed his victims.</p>
			<p>He introduced himself to Rama and Lakshmana as Kabandha and immediately sprung into action. He seized the brothers, one with each hand. In a rare moment of weakness, Lakshmana lost his composure and was overcome with fear. He implored Rama to escape from the clutches of the monster by sacrificing him, and proceed in search of Sita. As Rama urged Lakshmana to keep his cool, Kabandha threatened to devour them. Thinking swiftly, Rama said to Lakshmana, “Let’s cut off his hands.”</p>
			<p>No sooner had the brothers cut off the monster’s arms, Kabandha spoke, “Rama, I paid the price for my evil deeds with this ugly form. Now, I am redeemed by your divine intervention.” Kabandha then breathed his last and ascended heaven.</p>
			<p>Kabandha who was born as a demon, was once a handsome lad. He was granted the boon of long life by Brahma. He became arrogant and assailed Indra on the battle field. Indra struck him with arrows in such a manner that Kabandha’s thighs and face receded into his torso. Unable to bear this grotesque form, Kabandha begged Indra to kill him instead. Indra informed him that he would be freed from his sin when Rama and Lakshmana would sever his arms.</p>
			<p>However, before Kabandha departed he asked Rama and Lakshmana to go to the banks of the Pampa River and meet Sugreeva. “Befriend him and he will help you to find Sita,” Kabandha informed. Sugreeva was a vanara who, after being driven out of his kingdom by his brother Vaali, took refuge in Rishyamooka Hill.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Shabari</h2>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana, acted upon Kabandha’s suggestion and proceeded towards Pampa River. On the way they spotted an ashram. As they approached the hermitage, they heard someone calling out Rama’s name.</p>
			<p>She was Shabari, a disciple of Sage Mathanga. The sage had shed his mortal coils, but Shabari waited for the arrival of Rama as foretold by her guru. She had lost count of the days which passed into weeks, months and years as she patiently awaited Rama’s arrival. It was his name that she had on her lips all the time. Every day she would gather fresh juicy fruits from the forest trees for her Rama who she was certain, would come any day, any time. Years rolled by. There was no sign of Rama. But Shabari did not give up hope. Her heart told her Rama would undoubtedly come, if not today, tomorrow. Countless ‘tomorrows’ had passed by and yet there was no sight of Rama. Shabari was firm in her belief and continued to wait for Rama, gathering fruits for him, every day.</p>
			<p>That evening, as she stepped out of her hut calling out Rama’s name, she saw two men approaching her. In an instant, she knew her Rama had come! She forgot her age and ran towards him calling out, “Rama, my Lord, Rama, Oh Rama.” Rama gathered her in his arms and gently led her to the hut.</p>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana partook of the fruits Shabari lovingly offered.</p>
			<p>“Rama, I held on to this mortal body all these years only to behold you. I’m blessed. Now that I’ve seen you with my eyes, I have fed you with my hands, I have no more desire left. Allow me to depart from this world.” Those were the last words of that saintly woman.</p>
