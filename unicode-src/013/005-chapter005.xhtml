		<img src="images/013_Text_img_0.jpg" alt="logo" />
		<p>The vanaras surrounding Hanuman kept chanting, “Yes, Hanuman, you can cross the ocean in one leap, you can. Hanuman you can, you can …”</p>
		<p>As the chorus grew louder, Hanuman grew in size. When the animated shouts reached a crescendo, Hanuman stood tall, spanning the earth and sky.</p>
		<p>He prayed to all the gods and paid obeisance to his father Vayu. He silently saluted his master, Rama. As he took a deep breath, flexed his muscles, and pressed his feet on the hill, the ground on which he stood trembled, and many trees got uprooted.</p>
		<p>In one quick move, Hanuman lifted himself off the mountain peak and was soon air-borne, soaring far and high, speeding towards Lanka. The uprooted trees which were caught in the momentum of Hanuman’s mighty heave, flew after him, as if they wanted to give him their company. Hanuman looked like an enormous comet on fire as he travelled in space.</p>
		<p>Hanuman’s huge form cast a shadow on the sea as he cruised across the sky, and appeared like a ship that was being tossed about by fierce winds and swelling waves. He looked like a winged mountain, dragging a trail of clouds behind him. The heavenly beings showered flowers upon him and blessed him, and wished him success. The merciful sun kept himself mellow and the Wind god fanned him with cool breeze.</p>
		<p>When Hanuman was half way down to Lanka, a huge mountain rose up from the very depths of the ocean. The golden-hued mountain assumed a human form and stood on its own peak before Hanuman. “Oh noble Hanuman, I am Mount Mainaka. Since you are serving Rama, allow me to be useful to you. I would be greatly honoured if you would descend down on my peak and rest yourself awhile before continuing your journey.” Mainaka spoke to Hanuman and offered him fruits and roots to reinvigorate himself for the long and arduous flight to Lanka.</p>
		<p>The god of the ocean was indebted to King Sagara of the Ikshvaku dynasty. He therefore desired to help Hanuman find Sita, and approached Mount Mainaka to rise up from the ocean bed. “Mighty mountain, you are capable of growing in any direction. Please rise up from the waters and allow Hanuman to rest on you.”</p>
		<p>Mainaka who was obliged to Hanuman’s father Vayu, recounted to Hanuman his own story. “We mountains once enjoyed flying because we had wings. Just like Garuda, we too could fly across the sky at enormous speed. But all living beings including the rishis, devas and gandharvas feared that we might fall upon them and cause them harm. In a fit of temper, Indra aimed his thunderbolt at our wings. I was fortunate to escape his fury because your father, the glorious Vayu, intercepted Indra’s axe as it approached me, and saved me. He dropped me into the ocean with my wings intact.” Mainaka narrated this incident to Hanuman and once again urged the vanara hero to partake of his hospitality.</p>
		<p>Hanuman thanked Mainaka for his offer but politely declined, saying, “I have vowed to myself that I shall not rest until I accomplish my mission and find Sita.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman crosses the hurdles</h2>
			<p>Mainaka joined his hands in salutation to Hanuman who continued his journey towards Lanka with greater speed. The Devas, Rishis, Siddhas and Gandharvas wanted to test Hanuman’s might. They set Surasa, the mother of serpents, to execute their plan. Surasa assumed the form of a hideous monster and blocked Hanuman’s path. She opened her mouth wide and asked him to enter it. “Well, then open your mouth wide enough for me to enter,” said Hanuman, growing to a humongous size. As soon as the demon widened her mouth, Hanuman shrunk himself to the size of a thumb. Even before Surasa realized it, Hanuman entered her mouth, and came out of it, unscathed.</p>
			<p>Surasa assumed her true form when she realised how cleverly Hanuman had tricked her. She blessed him and wished him success in finding Sita.</p>
			<p>Hanuman continued towards Lanka, braving lightning, thunderstorms and torrential rains. He appeared to be gloriously suspended in the sky, like a wingless bird, the size of a mountain. But his troubles were not yet over. An ogress of mammoth size by name Simhika, who saw his enormous form, said to herself, “This creature would make a good meal for me.” She immediately grabbed Hanuman’s shadow and tugged at it.</p>
			<p>Hanuman suddenly felt his strength weaken. When he turned around to determine the cause of the obstruction, he noticed Simhika floating above the ocean. She was a demoness of great strength who could pull anyone simply by wrenching their shadow! When he recognized Simhika, Hanuman swelled himself to look like a huge mass of rain clouds. Simhika then opened her mouth as wide as the distance between the sky and the nether world. Hanuman once again revealed his ingenuity. He reduced himself to a tiny form and jumped into the ogre’s mouth. He came out of her mouth after ripping apart her insides with his claws. She fell into the ocean, dead.</p>
			<p>Hanuman surmounted the various obstacles on his way to Lanka with quick witted intelligence. He reached Lanka without further delay. “I have to be alert now. I should look for Sita without drawing attention to myself,” Hanuman cautioned himself and assumed his normal size.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman in Lanka </h2>
			<p>Hanuman perched himself on a tree on the outskirts of the city, to survey Lanka. Ravana’s kingdom stood splendorous on Mount Trikuta, encircled by a gigantic fort wall. There were armed guards and soldiers everywhere in the fort city. Hanuman pondered, “The rakshasas can neither be won over by good words, nor be appeased with gifts. Diplomacy too will not work with them. How will the vanara army cross the mighty ocean? Only Angada, Neela, Sugreeva and I, can leap across this infinite water body… No, but first things first! Let me find out the whereabouts of Sita.”</p>
			<p>As Hanuman walked towards the fort gate, Lankasri, the guardian<strong> </strong>deity of the city confronted him in all ferocity<strong>. </strong>She glared at him and demanded to know his identity and the purpose of his visit.</p>
			<p>“Lanka is well protected. There is no way you will be able to come in. If you care for your life, just disappear!” she thundered.</p>
			<p>Hanuman remained calm and unperturbed. “Who are you and why are you blocking my entry into the city?” He questioned Lankasri.</p>
			<p>“I am the deity of Lanka who protects the city. I will kill you if you try to make your way in,” she said, in a menacing tone.</p>
			<p>Hanuman ignored her threats. He told her that he was determined to have a tour of Lanka, to enjoy its magnificence.</p>
			<p>Lankasri was infuriated by Hanuman’s insistence and impudence. She gave him a powerful punch.</p>
			<p>Hanuman considered it discourteous to hit a woman with all his might. He therefore clenched his left fist and hit her lightly. But it was enough to shatter Lankasri’s limbs and she fell down with a thud. When she got up, she dusted herself and addressed Hanuman in a voice that trembled with fear: “You are indeed an extraordinary monkey, a hero of great power and intelligence. Now let me tell you a little truth about myself.” The Goddess of Lanka then revealed to Hanuman the prophetic words of Brahma who had said that when a monkey would overcome her, it would spell doom for Ravana and his rakshasa clan. “I have now become aware that you are the monkey mentioned by Brahma. And with your arrival here, our bad time is imminent. Go ahead, enter Lanka and fulfill the purpose for which you are here.”</p>
			<p>Hanuman jumped over the wall and entered the city, placing first, his left foot on its soil. The mansions and skyscrapers of Lanka glittered with gold, gems, ivory inlay sculptures. Colour was everywhere in Ravana’s kingdom – on its streets, its palaces, ponds, parks and forests. Lanka was pulsating with music, dance and merrymaking. While some of the rakshasas were chanting the Vedas, there were others who sang hymns praising Ravana.</p>
			<p>The heroic vanara observed the inhabitants of the city in an intoxicated state. He saw the rakshasas in their many shades of emotions and intelligence. Hanuman’s keen intellect and sharp eyes noticed how even the ugliest among the monsters had dressed with care. He saw the good and virtuous demons intermingling with the evil ones, and yet remaining chaste and untainted. Hanuman saw many beautiful ladies with sound sensibilities. But he saw no signs of Sita.</p>
			<p>Hanuman anxiously searched every nook and corner of Lanka for Rama’s beloved. He conducted a house-to-house search but found her nowhere. Then he saw Ravana’s palace on the mountain top, dazzle under the moonlit night. It was surrounded by a huge moat that was filled with lotus flowers. Hanuman entered the palace courtyard. Every area of the fortress was heavily guarded with elephants, horses, chariots and aerial cars.</p>
			<p>He finally approached Ravana’s personal stronghold where the demon king resided. It was fortified by several gates. In décor it bore semblance to Kubera’s mansion. The stately aerial vehicle, the Pushpaka Vimana, which itself had the appearance of a castle, graced the centre of the palace. It was held aloft by large white swans. It was built by the divine architect, Vishwakarma himself. The chariot of exceptional speed and splendor could travel at any height, unobstructed by anyone or anything, including the wind.</p>
			<p>The Pushpaka Vimana originally belonged to Kubera, the god of wealth. Brahma had rewarded him with it for the austerities he had performed. It was entirely bedecked with gems. Ravana overpowered Kubera and acquired the heavenly car for himself.</p>
			<p>Hanuman entered Ravana’s palace after looking for Sita everywhere else. Fragrance from burning incense and aroma of cooking delicacies, wafted as Hanuman went in. He beheld beautiful women in deep slumber. The floral wreaths on their curly tresses and their ornaments lay scattered around them. Their garments were disheveled as they lay sprawled in undesirable postures. It was obvious to Hanuman that these women had drunk themselves to exhaustion.</p>
			<p>There were several women here, who came from the virtuous homes of rishis, kings, gandharvas, devas and daityas. The daughters of these noble men were objects of Ravana’s fancy. He had won most of them in battles.</p>
			<p>Hanuman’s attention was then drawn to a lavish bed of quartz. It was inlaid with gemstones, ivory and gold. On it he saw Ravana, handsome and resplendent in all finery, blissfully asleep. A few of his wives were lying asleep at his feet.</p>
			<p>On another grandly decked couch, Hanuman saw a woman looking graceful in sleep. The suave beauty of this fair-complexioned lady embellished the very chamber in which Hanuman saw her. He thought she must be the pious Sita and felt overjoyed. His mirth, however, was short lived. Hanuman thought to himself, “She can’t be the devout daughter of Janaka, the righteous daughter-in-law of Dasharatha, and the beloved of Rama. For how would Sita, parted from Rama, sleep so peacefully? Sita of noble disposition, suffering pain on being separated from her dear Rama, would neither touch a drop of water nor sport jewelry.”</p>
			<p>In fact it was Mandodari, the pious wife of Ravana, who Hanuman beheld.</p>
			<p>Even after undertaking a thorough and extensive search in the inner chambers of the palace, Hanuman drew a blank. He did not sight Sita anywhere. He was saddened that his efforts had not yet borne fruit. On the other hand, he was plagued by guilt for having closely scrutinized women who were wives of other men. He felt he had transgressed moral codes in doing so. He battled with his conscience and finally consoled himself thinking, “It is only my deep yearning to restore Sita to beloved Rama that has made me look closely at the women here. I do not entertain any impure thoughts towards these ladies.”</p>
			<p>Faith and doubt pulled like strings around his throat. Hanuman became despondent and his mind gave way to negative thoughts. Could Sita have lost her life pining for Rama? Would that cruel Ravana have killed her for not yielding to him? Is it possible that Sita died of fear, looking at the grotesque rakshasas in Lanka? Perhaps, Sita did not reach Lanka at all! Ravana might have lost his grip on her as he flew across the mountains and oceans. And she might have fallen to her death! Or she might have got suffocated to death because of Ravana’s firm clasp of her throat. Probably, she is still alive, imprisoned in some dungeon in Lanka? Hanuman’s mind was churning with endless possibilities on what might have happened to Sita.</p>
			<p>However, despair and depression soon gave way to renewed hope. Hanuman recovered his equanimity and resolved to continue his search for Sita. Just then his roving eyes spotted an area in Lanka he had not searched. It was the magnificent Ashoka Vana, surrounded by a high wall.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-5.3">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman in Ashoka Vana</h2>
			<p>Hanuman, without losing more time, shrunk himself to an almost invisible size and entered Ashoka Vana. He prayed to all the gods and Devas to help him succeed in his efforts. By now it was daybreak. Hanuman was spellbound by the heavenly park. Spring was in the air. Nature was at its bounteous best in the expansive garden. Flowers were in full bloom. Ashoka Vana was paradise itself. Birds sang from their perch on trees. Peacocks, deer and other animals scampered freely in the vast expanse that was decked in gold, silver, gems and crystals. The mood in Ashoka Vana was chirpy as the rakshasas sang joyously and were engaged in playful activities.</p>
			<p>Hanuman lost himself in the enchanting beauty of Lanka and its Ashoka Vana. He jumped on to a tree that was dense with branches and dark green leaves. From his post on this tree he explored Ashoka Vana, his eyes wandering around its every corner, looking for Sita.</p>
			<p>Hanuman’s eyes fell on a temple that towered tall in the Vana precincts. He then caught sight of a woman surrounded by demons as she reclined against a tree. Hanuman made himself even smaller and leaped on to the tree under which the lady sat.</p>
			<p>He guessed her to be Sita. He had good reasons to suppose so. He saw on her the same earrings that Rama had described when he was leaving Kishkinda. The worn-out garment she wore, was of the same hue as the one she had thrown on Rishyamookha, with her jewels bundled in it.</p>
			<p>She was thin and pale. She wore soiled clothes and little jewelry. Yet she shone like the moon. She looked sorrowful, yet serene. Surrounded by rakshasis she looked helpless yet not lacking in courage. He could hear her heartbeat. It was beating, Rama, Rama. Hanuman joined his hands and bowed his head. All of a sudden he exclaimed: “Behold! I have seen Mother Sita! I have seen Rama’s beloved.” The fears and misgivings that Hanuman had earlier experienced, melted in this newfound rapture of having discovered Sita.</p>
			<p>Sita looked so divinely beautiful in complete contrast to the females sitting around her. Hanuman was charmed by her radiant look and admired her courageous demeanour in the face of adversity.</p>
			<p>“How dignified and graceful she looks even when placed in this miserable plight,” Hanuman thought to himself. He was eager to talk to her. He wanted to convey Rama’s message to her. But he held his patience. He waited for darkness to fall and the rakshasis to sleep.</p>
			<p>Hanuman’s initial euphoria on discovering Sita, soon dissipated and gave way to distress. The princess of Mithila and consort of Rama, born into wealth, had seen neither want nor hardship. She, upon whom attendants waited, was now surrounded by demons of most ugly form, who were bullying her.</p>
			<p>Though Hanuman carefully watched every movement in Ashoka Vana, his eyes remained focused on Sita. As twilight approached, he heard the chanting of Vedas followed by melodious strains from musical instruments. He soon saw Ravana walk towards Ashoka Vana, followed by his many demon wives.</p>
			<p>Ravana cast amorous glances at Sita. To Sita, his smile imparted no warmth to his face; if anything, it made him look more threatening. He shamelessly professed his love for her, describing her beauty, feature by feature. “Don’t imagine you will ever set eyes on Rama again! There is no way he will be able to get you back from me. Why do you pine for one who can offer you nothing but a life of an ascetic wandering in the forest? Marry me, and you will enjoy all pleasures of life. All my consorts will wait upon you. You can adorn yourself with an enormous variety of the most precious jewels you can ever hope to have.”</p>
			<p>Sita shuddered at Ravana’s very sight. Though she sat under the tree in soiled clothes, her thoughts were unsullied. She could think of none other than her beloved Rama. Sita felt repulsed by Ravana’s evil intents. She placed a blade of grass between herself and the demon king. As she wiped the tears that rolled down her cheeks, unchecked, she scoffed at Ravana’s overtures and boldly confronted him: “Don’t you dare compare yourself to my lord who is a fathomless well of goodness. Oh king of Lanka, stop seeking another man’s wife; rest satisfied with your queens. If you wish to save yourself from destruction, seek Rama’s forgiveness and friendship. He is ever-merciful and he will pardon you and protect you. There is none on this earth who can stand up to him. Did you not hear accounts of how he destroyed your brother Khara and hordes of other ogres in Janasthana, single-handed? Restore me to him and rescue yourself from falling down to greater depths of dishonour. Do not bring disaster upon yourself and your people.”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s face contorted with rage on hearing Sita’s sharp remarks. His eyes turned red, his nostrils flared, and his lips drew back from his teeth in a grating snarl. He kept his seething anger in control, and held his fists clasped by his sides. With teeth clenched, he threatened Sita, “You are lucky to get away with what you speak because of my love for you! Otherwise, you would be dead by now! It is high time you yield to my request. You have parried enough. I generously gave you twelve months’ time of which only two months remain. Give me the good news soon.”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s menacing tone made some of the noble ogres wince. They were daughters of gods and gandharvas who had been forcefully coveted by Ravana because he had won them in battles. They reassured Sita with subtle gestures and glances. Emboldened by their supportive gesticulations, Sita responded to Ravana’s warning: “Oh ignoble creature, it certainly appears that Lanka does not have a single well-intentioned soul who can dissuade you from walking this evil path. Be assured that you will not escape punishment for this most immoral proposal that you have made to me, Rama’s consort. Why, I myself have the power to reduce you to ashes this very moment! But I refrain from doing so because I have not sought my Lord, Rama’s permission to do so. Wicked king of Lanka, become aware now, that I was not capable of being seized by you in the first place. What is happening, is destiny’s drama to bring about your destruction!”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s anger increased with each word that Sita spoke. He shot back at her, I could kill you right away instead of pleading with you.” The king of Lanka was unyielding. He wanted to possess Sita at any cost. He ordered the demons to bend and break Sita’s spirits so that she would accede to his wish.</p>
			<p>Ravana’s most favourite wife, Mandodari, tried to calm him down and make him see reason. “Do you not realize that you will only bring misery upon yourself by craving for a woman who does not love you? Instead, you would be wise to love a woman who dotes on you.” Ravana merely guffawed at Mandodari’s logic as he departed from Ashoka Vana to his own palace.</p>
			<p>The monstrous demons began to act upon Ravana’s command. They cajoled, coaxed and bullied Sita to comply with his desire. “You should consider yourself fortunate to be the wife of one who has vanquished the mightiest of gods. What joy or comforts can Rama, driven out of his own kingdom, give you? Oh foolish woman, abandon your stubbornness and marry the powerful Ravana who adores you.”</p>
			<p>Sita felt repulsed by the sinful advice given by the ogres. “My Rama is my most prized jewel. What need have I for comforts when Rama is my consort? Whether he is a king or a wandering mendicant, I will remain devoted to him alone,” Sita retorted.</p>
			<p>Hanuman remained patient on his perch and heard every word of the conversations between Sita and Ravana and those between Sita and the other ogres. He realized in full measure, Sita’s inherent dignity, her divine nature and her love for Rama.</p>
			<p>Within moments, Hanuman also sensed that Sita was reaching breaking point as the ogres tortured and tormented her. Tears gushed down her cheeks and in despair, she wished herself dead. “Eat me if you will, but I will not heed your evil advice,” she said. Sita was rendered incapable of reasoning as the rakshasa women continued to violently bash her emotionally. In sheer desperation, she cried out: “Oh Rama, Oh, Lakshmana, Mother Kausalya, will none of you come to my rescue! Rama, my life is meaningless without you. I don’t see any signs of you coming to save me. I wonder what sin I committed in my previous birth to beget such sorrow now. It is only right that I put an end to myself and to the misery I experience!”</p>
			<p>As Sita sat bewailing her lot, Trijata, an aged ogress who had hitherto been asleep, woke up with a jolt. Seeing Sita threatened by her co-ogresses, she warned them of the impending disaster that would befall them all. Trijata narrated to them, a dream she has seen which augured ill for their king and people. On the one hand, she had dreamt of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana with garlands around their necks, mount a celestial chariot drawn by several horses. On the other hand, she had a vision of Ravana, his siblings and sons, doused in oil, fall headlong from the backs of donkeys.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Sita who was frustrated and depressed, decided to end her life by strangling herself with the cord she used for bundling up her hair. Just then, she observed auspicious signs on her body. Her left eye throbbed, her left arm palpitated and her left thigh pulsated. She felt the presence of Rama beside her. Sita was encouraged by these and other omens she considered as good. Her spirits lifted and with it, her mind cleared of the confusion she had earlier felt.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman meets Sita</h2>
			<p>It was the dark hours of the night and the rakshasis guarding Sita, tired from threatening her, fell into deep slumber. Hanuman was awaiting this opportune moment to approach Sita and convey Rama’s message to her. However, his mind was riddled with questions. How should he approach Sita without startling her? How would he introduce himself to her? Once he identified himself, what would he tell her? Now that I have seen her and know her whereabouts, what if I depart from Lanka without meeting her? If I leave Lanka without reassuring her of Rama’s arrival here to rescue her, she might give up her life! This would defeat the very purpose for which I have come here. But how do I initiate a conversation with the pious Sita? Well, I could talk to her in Sanskrit. But she might mistake me for Ravana in disguise! What if she cries out upon seeing me? The rakshasis would then wake up and seeing me, they would raise an alarm. Hanuman weighed the merits of the options before him. After much deliberation, he decided to remain hidden. He concluded that he would narrate Rama’s story, from his birth, to the present, sitting on the treetop. He would include in this recital his own arrival at Lanka in search of Sita.</p>
			<p>In soft tones, Hanuman began to sing the story and glory of Rama, beloved of Sita. He began extolling the virtues of King Dasharatha of the Ikshvaku family and then went on to recount the childhood and youth of his four sons. Hanuman related in a lucid manner, Rama’s banishment from Ayodhya, his subsequent confrontations with several demons, of how he vanquished Khara in Janasthana and the consequent abduction of Sita. Hanuman completed his rendition by describing Rama’s search for Sita in the forests of Dandaka. He sang the glory of the friendship that blossomed between Sugreeva, the vanara chief and Rama. He narrated how Rama had made Sugreeva the king of Kishkinda after killing his brother Vaali. Finally Hanuman melodiously sang, describing his own role as Sugreeva’s chief minister who had now come to Lanka in search of Sita.</p>
			<p>Hearing the story of Rama, Sita was delighted and scared at the same time. “Who could this be, who is singing beloved Rama’s story in such soothing words? Perhaps, he is a rakshasa trying to trick me?”</p>
			<p>Sita looked all around to locate the source of the voice. As she looked up, she saw a little monkey sitting on the branch above her. While she was wonderstruck on seeing him, she was also terrified at dreaming of a monkey. “Dreaming of a monkey does not auger well,” Sita thought. “But sleep has eluded me ever since I was separated from Rama! No, this cannot be a dream!” she argued within herself. Sita thought the monkey’s words were a figment of her imagination since she constantly thought of Rama. His name alone was eternally on her lips, mind and heart. She prayed to the gods that the monkey’s words be true. As she turned over these thoughts in her mind and oscillated between hope and doubt, Hanuman gently came down from his perch. He stood before her, palms joined and head bowed in reverence to Sita. Hanuman was yet again struck by Sita, who was a picture of beauty, chastity, grace and poise.</p>
			<p>He then spoke to her in a gentle voice, full of respect. “Oh, noble mother, may I know who you are and how you come to be here? From you demeanour and disposition, I gather you are the gracious Sita, consort of Rama, mercilessly carried away by the demon king of Lanka!”</p>
			<p>Sita who was delighted to hear Rama’s name, told Hanuman he was right in presuming she was Sita, Rama’s wife. She then narrated her story to him.</p>
			<p>Hanuman then introduced himself to her as Rama’s emissary. He related to her the pangs of pain Rama suffered after losing her, and how he sought Sugreeva’s help in finding her. Sita, however, was still doubtful of Hanuman’s true identity. Hanuman sensed her hesitation. He immediately took out Rama’s signet ring and handed it to Sita.</p>
			<p>“Mother, Rama asked me to give this to you as proof that I am a messenger sent by him,” said Hanuman, bowing respectfully before Sita.</p>
			<p>Sita was overjoyed at this meeting with Hanuman. She took the ring from him and pressed it to her eyes repeatedly. It was as if she was seeing Rama himself.</p>
			<p>“If Rama is grief-stricken as you say, why does he not come to rescue me at once? If Rama does not save me within two months, Ravana will make meat of me,” Sita lamented. “Ravana is adamant on making me his wife. His youngest brother Vibheeshana, a virtuous soul, admonished him for having abducted me. He has repeatedly advised him to restore me to Rama. But Ravana remains stubborn. Vibheeshana’s wife sent his daughter Kala to inform me of this. O noble Hanuman, ask Rama to come here and fetch me right away!”</p>
			<p>Hanuman responded by telling Sita that Rama would be able to reach Lanka only after he, Hanuman himself returned to Kishkinda with news of his beloved Sita. “But mother, I myself can take you to Rama immediately. You may sit on my back as I leap across the ocean and take you to Mount Prasravana where Rama resides.”</p>
			<p>Sita was overjoyed by Hanuman’s offer. Nevertheless, she declined it, saying: “It would be most worthy of Rama to take me back with him after he kills Ravana. So make haste and return with Rama to deliver me from this evil demon.”</p>
			<p>Hanuman comforted Sita: “Rest assured mother, Rama will surely save you from the wretched Ravana.”</p>
			<p>As Hanuman took leave of Sita, he asked her for a token to take back to Rama as proof of his having met her. Sita responded by telling Hanuman that a message to Rama was the best token she could give him. She narrated to Hanuman an incident that took place when they dwelt in a hermitage near the Mandakini River while serving their exile. A hungry crow that was greedy for meat repeatedly tried to peck Sita when she and Rama were relaxing. To Rama’s amusement, Sita delicately defended herself by making mud balls and throwing it at the crow to shoo it away. The crow showed no signs of relenting. Sita who was exhausted from trying to ward off the crow, sought refuge in Rama’s lap. While they were asleep in each others’ arms, the crow returned to claw Sita’s breasts. Blood from the wound, oozed on the sleeping Rama and he woke up. Rama was enraged with the crow’s act. He pulled out a kusa grass from the garden and made it potent as the Brahmastra. As he made to strike the crow with it, the bird who was in reality Indra’s son, begged Rama for forgiveness. However, the missile once discharged could not be recalled. Rama therefore spared the crow’s life, but blinded its right eye with the weapon. When Sita finished recounting the incident to Hanuman, she questioned, “When Rama, my beloved, was so angered by a crow, that he immediately rose to fight it, why is he keeping quiet when Ravana has whisked me away with mal-intent?”</p>
			<p>Sita then handed Hanuman a piece of her jewelry, saying: “Rama would be happy to see this as proof of your having met me. Give it to him when you reach Kishkinda.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman the destroyer</h2>
			<p>Hanuman desired to instill more confidence in Sita. At the same time he wanted to create fear in the minds of Ravana and his demons. He wanted to warn the demon king of his impending destruction at the hands of Rama.</p>
			<p>After some deliberation, Hanuman once again assumed a mammoth form. He laid waste, the beautiful Ashoka Vana. He did this without destroying the area occupied by Sita in the Vana.</p>
			<p>The sleeping rakshasis woke up, hearing the noises around them. They saw the huge monkey and the havoc he had created. They rushed to Ravana: “There is a huge monkey that has ruined our lovely AshokaVana. We also saw it talking to Sita.”</p>
			<p>Ravana was outraged when he heard this. “Kill this monstrous monkey,” he shouted orders to his guards.</p>
			<p>Hanuman was all set for the confrontation with Ravana’s guards. He brandished his most cherished possession, his tail. He swished it around and leaped from one place to another. He attacked the soldiers and killed them all. When he was satisfied with the chaos he had created, he sat smugly on top of the pillared entrance gate of Lanka. He began singing praises of Rama and Lakshmana.</p>
			<p>Hanuman shook the city of Lanka with loud roars that echoed throughout the region. The rakshasas trembled in fear at this. When Ravana was informed that his guards had been killed by Hanuman, he sent the mighty warrior Jambumali to capture the monkey. Soon messengers brought the news that Jambumali was killed in the battle with the monkey.</p>
			<p>Ravana then summoned his favourite son Aksha and ordered him to fight Hanuman. Aksha, young and radiant with energy, rode on his golden chariot to battle Hanuman. When he saw the son of Vayu, he was impressed with the monkey’s well-proportioned body.</p>
			<p>Aksha said to himself: “This promises to be a well-poised battle. This monkey seems an enemy worthy of a fight.” Aksha sent a volley of arrows at Hanuman. A fierce clash ensued between the two. As arrows rained on Hanuman, he skillfully avoided getting hit by them. He admired the courage and valour displayed by the youthful Aksha. As the battle progressed, Aksha grew mightier. Hanuman charged against his opponent’s chariot and smashed it to pieces. The horses fell dead. Aksha was undaunted. He rose in the air, bow and arrow in hand. The battled raged fiercely in the air. Hanuman delivered the final blow and the young hero fell dead.</p>
			<p>Ravana’s wrath increased manifold when he heard Aksha had been killed. He called for his son Indrajit, the conqueror of Indra.</p>
			<p>“None in the world can equal you in strength or foresight. You have mastery of all weapons. Your knowledge of battle tactics is unparalleled. Further, you have the coveted Brahmastra with you. Go, deal appropriately with this terrible monkey and return victorious,” thundered Ravana.</p>
			<p>Indrajit took Ravana’s blessings and proceeded to meet Hanuman. The two combatants were equally matched in strength and skill. A powerful battle followed. All the celestial beings, the nagas, yakshas and siddhas gathered in the sky to watch this encounter. Darts and arrows flew in the skies. Hanuman rose in the sky becoming bigger than ever. He deftly fielded the weapons hurled at him. No matter how many arrows Indrajit showered on him, Hanuman stood strong.</p>
			<p>“My arrows cannot destroy this monkey. My father was right. I can contain this creature only by using the Brahmastra,” thought Indrajit to himself. The Brahmastra was the most powerful of weapons. Indrajit had received it from Brahma himself because of the austerities he had performed.</p>
			<p>Without wasting time, Indrajit directed the Brahmastra at Hanuman. As soon as it touched him, Hanuman became helpless as he was bound by the weapon. He lay still and awaited the right moment to strike back.</p>
			<p>The rakshasas gathered around him and began merry-making. They abused and shouted insults at him. They threatened to cut him to pieces.</p>
			<p>“This monkey is not one to give up easily. He is perhaps, pretending to lie helpless. He might rise up suddenly and attack us.” Some of the rakshasas began talking amongst themselves.</p>
			<p>“Let us take no chances with him. Let us tie him with ropes,” they concurred. Hanuman was duly bound tightly with ropes of jute and coconut fibre. He was then dragged through the streets of Lanka and taken to Ravana’s court.</p>
			<p>Hanuman surveyed his surrounds as he stood before the demon king. Ravana, clad in golden-coloured silken robes looked resplendent on his throne. The crown on his head glittered with gold and inlaid gems. Hanuman gazed at the rich ornamentation of his court, and at Ravana himself.</p>
			<p>Hanuman had mixed feelings when he beheld Ravana in all majesty and grandeur. He was filled with anger, wonder and pity at the same time. He thought, “What form, what radiance, what strength! If only this king had not swayed from the path of dharma! Not even Indra could have rivaled him in greatness. Alas, Ravana has chosen to bring doom on himself by straying from righteous behavior.”</p>
			<p>“It does not befit a king of your stature and learning, to carry off another man’s wife and hold her captive,” Hanuman tried to convince Ravana of his wrongdoing. “Return Sita with all honour to Rama and seek his forgiveness. If not, Rama is bound to kill you and destroy your kingdom.”</p>
			<p>Ravana was outraged at Hanuman’s words. He ordered his men to kill him. Vibheeshana, Ravana’s righteous younger brother, intervened. “Brother, it is against our law to kill envoys and messengers. Hurt him in any way you would, but do not kill him.”</p>
			<p>Ravana accepted Vibheeshana’s advice. He asked his men to set fire to Hanuman’s most prized possession, his tail.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Lanka set ablaze</h2>
			<p>The guards carried out Ravana’s command with gusto. They dragged the monkey out to the street, doused his tail with oil and set it ablaze. Hanuman then increased his size and made his escape.</p>
			<p>“I must leave signs of having come here,” said Hanuman to himself. “I must teach Ravana a lesson.”</p>
			<p>He began jumping from tree to tree, building to building and set fire to whatever came his way. Everything in Lanka, except the tree in Ashoka Vana under which Sita sat, was up in flames.</p>
			<p>Hanuman was satisfied with what he had accomplished. He extinguished the fire on his tail by diving into the sea. He was ready to fly back to Kishkinda to give Rama the good tidings. Before leaving Lanka, he once again made his salutations to Sita and took her blessings.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The vanaras rejoice</h2>
			<p>Hanuman was soon airborne to join his friends on the other shore of the sea. The vanaras were beside themselves with joy when they saw Hanuman flying towards them.</p>
			<p>When he told his friends he had found Sita, the vanaras were excited at Hanuman’s achievement. They danced, sang, laughed boisterously and made merry.</p>
			<p>“Tell us how you found Sita! How does she look? How did Ravana behave? How did you deal with him?” The vanaras bombarded Hanuman with questions. Hanuman who felt humbled by the experience, calmly narrated the events in Lanka to them.</p>
			<p>“It is only right that we report your findings to Rama who is anxiously awaiting your return,” Jambavan said, after Hanuman finished recounting his visit to Lanka.</p>
			<p>All the vanaras proceeded to Kishkinda to give Rama the joyous news of having found Sita.</p>
			<p>On the way to Kishkinda, the monkeys saw Sugreeva’s most cherished grove, the Madhuvana. The fragrance of flowers, fruits and honey that wafted through the air was too tempting for the monkeys to resist. The vast orchard was well guarded by Sugreeva’s maternal uncle Dadhimukha who was its security chief. The simian force was in ecstatic spirit, buoyed by Hanuman’s success. They desired to celebrate the accomplishment with fun, frolic and feasting. They sought Angada’s permission to enter Madhuvana and partake of the aromatic nectar that hid inside the inviting honeycombs ornamenting several trees. Once inside Madhuvana, the monkeys ran amok in delight. They swung from tree to tree, grabbing and boring their teeth into luscious fruits. They indulged in riotous feasting with singing, dancing, and play, throwing half-eaten fruits at each other. A carnival atmosphere prevailed as the monkeys rejoiced in gay abandon.</p>
			<p>Hanuman who could sense their joy supported their celebration and allowed them to drink honey to their hearts content. The vanaras felt encouraged. They pulled down the honeycombs and devoured the honey, intoxicated like seasoned addicts. They drowned themselves in its sweetness and lost their senses. They went berserk with delight and uprooted trees, trampled plants, plucked flowers and scattered them on the lawns.</p>
			<p>Dadhimukha was alarmed and angered when he saw the monkeys destroy Sugreeva’s prized garden. When he tried to ward them off, the monkeys pounced on him, clawed at him and punched him. Dadhimukha, helpless in the face of the simian rampage, rushed to Kishkinda to inform Sugreeva of the destruction of Madhuvana. Sugreeva, who was in the company of Rama and Lakshmana at that time, was overjoyed upon hearing Dadhimukha’s laments! “I am sure Hanuman and his stalwarts, bring us good news. They must have found Sita! For, without succeeding in their mission, they would not indulge in such unruly feasting.”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva’s voice carried his chirpy spirits as he ordered Dadhimukha to return to Madhuvana and ask Hanuman and his army to return to Kishkinda without further delay. “And yes, let the monkeys rejoice. Let them celebrate their success!” he added.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama overwhelmed with joy</h2>
			<p>Dadhimukha returned to Madhuvana and asked the vanaras to immediately hurry to Kishkinda. The monkeys who felt satisfied with all the feasting, followed Hanuman and Angada to Kishkinda.</p>
			<p>When the vanaras rejoined Rama, Angada and Jambavan recounted to him their search for Sita, Sampati’s tip and the great leap across the sea by Hanuman. The vanara hero who had achieved the incredible feat of crossing the ocean remained humbly silent. He did not utter one word of boast about his rare deed until Rama turned to him and eagerly enquired about Sita.</p>
			<p>“I have seen Mother Sita. I met your pure and divine queen. I spoke to the graceful lady who is your wife. I bring you good tidings. Mother Sita is safe even though she is in the midst of the wicked rakshasis,” Hanuman spoke, bowing reverentially to Rama.</p>
			<p>“Where exactly did you see my beloved Sita? How is she? What did she tell you? Is she being ill-treated by Ravana and the demons in Lanka? Is she looking pale? Has she become thin?” Rama was full of questions to Hanuman.</p>
			<p>“Dear Hanuman, please tell me all,” Rama was overcome with emotion.</p>
			<p>He was overwhelmed by intense waves of pleasure. Tears flowed down his cheeks like a waterfall in deluge as Hanuman narrated his meeting with Sita and the events at Lanka.</p>
			<p>“Without you, Mother Sita finds life unbearable. She is holding on to life only to see you again. She is frail and weak without eating. She is living on air and draws energy from the repetition of her Lord’s name. Her heart beats for her Lord, Rama.. Rama.. Rama..”</p>
			<p>Rama broke down when Hanuman described how he found Sita in Ashoka Vana.</p>
			<p>“Mother Sita wants you to rescue her from Ravana as soon as possible. She gave me her crest jewel to hand over to you as a proof of my meeting her.” Hanuman then handed over to Rama, the piece of jewelry that Sita had given him.</p>
			<p>More tears flowed from Rama’s eyes as he saw the piece of jewelry. Rama lauded Hanuman for the monumental task he had accomplished. “Bless you, dear son of Vayu. It is as if I am seeing my Sita through your eyes. None could have done what you have. You have achieved the impossible! I thank you Hanuman for this great service that you have rendered me.” Rama hugged Hanuman close to him and said, “High-souled Hanuman, what can I give you for this invaluable task that you have accomplished! I have nothing to offer you today except my heartfelt embrace.”</p>
