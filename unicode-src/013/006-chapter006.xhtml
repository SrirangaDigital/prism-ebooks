		<img src="images/013_Text_img_0.jpg" alt="logo" />
		<p>Rama and the vanara force were elated at Hanuman’s feat. They began planning their strategy to enter Lanka and rescue Sita. The sons of Dasharatha knew that they had to move fast as time was running out for them. They had only two months within which to land in Lanka, fight Ravana and rescue Sita.</p>
		<p>At the appointed auspicious hour, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sugreeva’s army, departed for Lanka, proceeding in the southward direction. The vanara force was in joyous spirits. They were happy to be part of Rama’s cause, eager to fight Ravana and secure Sita. They crossed mountains, rivers, cascading falls and forests along the way. The monkeys bathed and played in the water bodies and feasted on the fruits, roots and berries in the jungles. Finally they reached the sea and camped on the seashore.</p>
		<p>When Rama saw the ocean waves rise and fall in rhythmic patterns, he was overcome by a wave of nostalgia. He longed to have Sita by his side and once again began to brood over his separation from her. “Time” was not a healer for Rama. Each passing minute was a burden for him because it increased the pain of separation from Sita.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vibheeshana’s advice</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, Ravana called an assembly of his ministers. He wanted to take stock of the situation and assess the damage caused to his kingdom by a mere monkey.</p>
			<p>“It is evident that Rama is our enemy. How do we strengthen our city and defend ourselves against him?” Ravana addressed his council of ministers.</p>
			<p>The ministers praised Ravana and convinced him of his power and strength. “Why should you fear Rama when you have fought greater beings with aplomb? Our warriors are enough to deal with Rama. We have weapons to crush anyone who challenges you.”</p>
			<p>While the ministers heaped praises on Ravana and his army, Vibheeshana addressed him: “Brother, it is indeed nice to hear what these people say. But it is not good or sensible advice to act upon. I do not desire to flatter you. I wish to save you from grave danger while it is still possible. Rama had done us no harm. If he fought and killed our men in Dandaka forest, he did so only in self-defense. He did it to protect the inhabitants of the forest. Yet you carried his wife away. This unpardonable sin does not befit you. It is against dharma. Even now it is not too late to make amends. Restore Sita to Rama and he will forgive you.”</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana’s pleas to Ravana fell on deaf ears. “No. Never! I will neither restore Sita nor ask Rama for forgiveness,” Ravana roared. His eyes turned red with rage and he defiantly announced, “I will fight Rama in battle. Nothing, or no one can make me change my mind.”</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana who loved his brother persisted in his good counsel. He drew Ravana’s attention to the evil portents observed in Lanka since Sita’s arrival. Sacrificial fires were engulfed in smoke, reptiles surfaced in the palace kitchens, udders of cows ran dry, flocks of crows gave harsh cries, swarms of vultures hovered over the city and wild animals howled outside the city gates. “The forces of evil have been let lose. It is only wise that you restore Sita to Rama,” Vibheeshana pleaded.</p>
			<p>However, Ravana was beyond reason. He was not prepared to restore Sita to Rama.</p>
			<p>Kumbhakarna, another younger brother, who loved Ravana very much, voiced his honest thoughts to him. “Beloved brother, if you had any grouse against Rama, you should have confronted him with it. You did not act right in carrying Sita away. Actions that flout moral codes of conduct and ethics surely result in sin.”</p>
			<p>Ravana stubbornly stood his ground.</p>
			<p>“Well, if you have made up your mind, I shall fight the sons of Dasharatha and slay them. Victory will be yours, brother,” said Kumbhakarna, with an air of finality.</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana was steadfast in his resolve. He did not wish to stray into the path of adharma. He extolled the virtues of Rama and sang praises of his valour and might. He made one final effort to make Ravana see sense. “Our defeat is certain if we fight Rama. I beg you brother, return Sita. She rightfully belongs to Rama and no one else. Save yourself from this sinful act and also our people from destruction.”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s son Indrajit scoffed at Vibheeshana whose wisdom was known to equal that of sage Brihaspathi. He ridiculed his uncle for lacking in valour, courage and the spirit of heroism. In angry tones laced with sarcasm, he said, “Being a descendant of the great Pulastya, what shameful words do you utter, uncle! Are you afraid of these mere mortals, Rama and Lakshmana? You insult our lineage by giving father such cowardly advice!”</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana responded to Indrajit’s tirade with calculated anger, “You are still too young and do not have the capacity to see right from wrong. By goading him on this evil path, you are only ensuring his doom.”</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana held his ground. Ravana was equally unyielding. “You talk like a coward, brother. If I act upon your words, it would only bring dishonor to the rakshasas.” It was obvious that Ravana was lost to reason. Vibheeshana realized there was no place for him in Lanka because he did not wish to be a party to the wrongful deed his brother was intent on committing. He renounced all his possessions and left Lanka to join hands with Rama.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vibheeshana joins Rama </h2>
			<p>When Sugreeva noticed Vibheeshana and a few of his armed companions approach their camp, he became apprehensive. He suspected Vibheeshana’s intentions and believed he had come as Ravana’s spy. While Sugreeva watched Vibheeshana with alertness, the latter stopped midway in flight. He addressed Sugreeva, “I’m Vibheeshana, Ravana’s brother. I refused to support my brother in his unholy quest. I have been unable to dissuade Ravana from committing the dishonourable act of coveting Sita. He is unyielding. Four of my close friends and I, have therefore abandoned Lanka and have come to seek refuge in Rama.”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva conveyed Vibheeshana’s words to Rama. At the same time, he cautioned Rama to be careful in dealing with him. Rama promptly called an assembly of the senior members of the vanara force and consulted them on the issue. Angada suggested testing Vibheeshana’s trustworthiness. Other vanara elders suggested spying on him to ascertain his true intentions. “One’s face mirrors one’s inner feelings and nature. I do not see lie and deceit on Vibheeshana’s face, nor do I get a hint of it in his voice. Let us accept him as one of us,” Hanuman expressed his opinion when Rama asked him to do so.</p>
			<p>Rama was delighted to hear Hanuman echo his own sentiments. “Yes. Moreover, how can I refuse to protect one who seeks refuge in me?” The issue was settled without much fuss, to everyone’s satisfaction.</p>
			<p>Rama received Vibheeshana with great love. Vibheeshana and his friends prostrated at Rama’s feet. The pious and noble brother of Ravana then apprised Rama of the events in Lanka that led to his departure from the kingdom. He also explained how even Kumbhakarna disapproved of Ravana’s act, but chose to stand by him out of loyalty to his brother. Vibheeshana said, “Though I love my brother, I cannot take sides with adharma. Inspite of my best efforts I failed to persuade Ravana to restore Sita to you and seek your pardon.”</p>
			<p>Rama could see it was not an easy decision to forsake one’s own brother for the cause of dharma. Yet, here was Vibheeshana who acted with courage at the risk of being misunderstood for deserting his brother. Rama embraced Vibheeshana. He also promised to crown him as the king of Lanka after fighting the war with Ravana and defeating him. In the presence of the vanara forces, Rama carried out the consecration of Vibheeshana with holy water from the sea.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Ravana made an attempt to win over Sugreeva to his side. One evening, Sugreeva saw a parrot flying across the sky. It landed on his shoulder. It was a rakshasa by name Shuka in disguise. He was a messenger from Ravana who incited Sugreeva to desert Rama and return to Kishkinda with his vanara army. Sugreeva spurned Ravana’s offer of friendship and sent away the envoy from Lanka.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama prays to the ocean </h2>
			<p>Rama, along with Vibheeshana and the vanaras strategized for the war. They first had to find a way to cross the mighty ocean to reach Lanka.</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana then suggested to Rama to seek the help of the ocean to enable them cross it. “Since King Sagara of the Ikshvaku linage was instrumental in digging the ocean, thus giving it life, the ocean will surely help you, Rama,” said Vibheeshana. His advice appealed to Rama and the vanara chief.</p>
			<p>Rama prayed to the ocean to provide a passage so that he and his army could walk across to Lanka. For three days he prayed and there was no response from the ocean. This made Rama angry. He said, “If well-meaning sentiments and virtues such as patience, politeness, pity, and plain speaking are perceived as signs of meekness, let me show the ocean what I can do!”</p>
			<p>Rama then threatened to dry up the ocean and cause all the creatures dwelling in it to disappear. He picked up his bow and took aim at the ocean.”If you do not grant us a passage, I know how to make one,” he said, in a quiet yet menacing voice. As Rama strung his bow, the world was plunged in darkness. All the natural forces began to display abnormal behavior.</p>
			<p>It was then that a splendorous figure rose from the ocean. He was the lord of the ocean, who stood reverentially before Rama with folded hands. He pointed out to Rama that the five elements had to obey the eternal laws of nature. “There is a way to travel across the ocean,” he said. He suggested that Rama should build a long causeway to connect the two shores. “But rest assured that the creatures of the sea will not harm your force. The alligators, sharks and all other animals that inhabit my realms, will remain non- aggressive. You may carry on the building of your bridge without fear of being attacked by them,” the lord of the ocean promised. Rama accepted the suggestion and lowered his bow.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">A squirrel’s contribution</h2>
			<p>He approached Nala, the vanara engineer, to build the giant causeway across the sea. Nala, the son of the divine architect Vishwakarma, was only too happy to oblige Rama. The monkeys, under the watchful eyes of Nala, transported huge boulders and dropped them into the sea to build the bridge to Lanka.</p>
			<p>Rama was very happy to see the high energy level, passion and dedication of his army towards constructing the bridge. Many forest animals and birds were watching the vanaras at work. Among them was a squirrel that was devoted to Rama. Though small in size, it too wanted to chip in its bit towards his cause. It carried small pebbles in its mouth and dropped them into the sea alongside the boulders. The squirrel repeated this continuously and effortlessly. A monkey who saw its activity mocked at it and asked it to stay away, saying it would die if it came under the boulder or feet of the vanara army. Upon this, all the other monkeys and bears joined in ridiculing the squirrel and laughed at it. The squirrel was driven to tears but it continued to pick the pebbles and told the vanara force that it too wished to help them in getting Sita free from the clutches of Ravana. Rama was overwhelmed to see its devotion. As he watched this sight, the squirrel which was now carrying a bigger pebble stumbled and fell from a height. Rama moved swiftly and caught it on time. The squirrel felt overjoyed at Rama’s touch. Rama stroked it lovingly and gently dropped it to the ground. It is widely believed that the stripes we see on a squirrel’s back are the result of Rama’s caressing stroke on this squirrel’s back. Rama then showed the monkey army how the pebbles that it had thrown into the sea served to fill the gap between two boulders. He made them realize that its contribution was as big as that of any other member of his army.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Walk on the sea link</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile the work on the bridge made brisk progress. When it was finally ready, Vibheeshana and the huge vanara army set out on it for a long walk to the island fortress of Lanka. While Hanuman carried Rama on his shoulder, Angada took Lakshmana on his. The vanaras raised victory cries and marched ahead, eager to battle. Soon they reached Mount Suvela on the seashore and rested on it for the night.</p>
			<p>The following morning, Rama took a good look at Lanka, resting majestically atop the Trikuta Mountain. The city of Lanka was beautiful and prosperous. Rama felt sad that for one man’s folly the entire population of Lanka was going to suffer. At the same time, he reminded himself that he should focus on overcoming Ravana. Sugreeva marshalled his troops and systematically organized their formation in preparation for war.</p>
			<p>When Ravana learned of Rama having crossed the sea with Sugreeva’s forces, he sent two of his ministers, Suka and Sarana to penetrate the enemy camp. He ordered them to spy on their foe and assess their strength, their numbers and the weaponry at their disposal. The demon ministers entered Sugreeva’s army, disguised as monkeys. But Vibheeshana recognized them and took them to Rama. They confessed to being spies sent by Ravana. Rama set them free with a message for Ravana, “Tell your king that tomorrow’s dawn will spell doom for him and his grand city of Lanka.”</p>
			<p>Suka and Sarana, while conveying Rama’s message to Ravana, extolled the virtues of Rama. “Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva and Vibheeshana, are very virtuous. Moreover, they have such matchless weapons, that we do not stand any chance of winning against them. In fact, Rama alone is capable of destroying Lanka. O king of Lanka, wisdom therefore lies in making peace with Rama by restoring Sita to him.”</p>
			<p>Ravana remained unyielding. “Even if gods asked me to return Sita, I would not do so!” The king of Lanka was only interested in getting the information that the two ministers had gathered from the rival camp. Suka and Sarana duly gave Ravana a detailed report on the organization of the vanara army, highlighting the skills and strengths of each commander. Once he received this information, he expelled the two ministers from his court for having praised the enemy forces. He dispatched yet other ogres to Rama’s field to carry on espionage.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana’s deceit </h2>
			<p>Ravana was disturbed by the reports he heard of the advancing enemy. He tried to induce fear in Sita to get her to submit to his overtures. He commanded Vidyujjihva, his court magician to produce an illusory head of Rama. At the behest of Ravana, Vidyujjihva brandished the head before Sita at Ashoka Vana as proof that Rama had been killed.</p>
			<p>Sita burst into tears upon seeing Rama’s head, and soon fainted. When she recovered, she lamented her fate and spoke with disdain of astrologers who had predicted long life for Rama. She shot a fiery glance at Ravana who urged her to submit to him now that Rama was dead. “Kill me right away and let my body be placed alongside Rama,” she wailed. As Ravana was threatening Sita, a messenger arrived from his court, bringing news that required him to act urgently. As soon as Ravana left Sita and Ashoka Vana, Rama’s head too disappeared!</p>
			<p>An ogress by name Sarama took pity on Sita who was distraught with grief on learning of Rama’s death. She comforted Sita and disclosed to her the fact that Rama was well and alive. Sarama revealed to Sita that the head was an illusory one created by the court magician. In addition, Sarama kept Sita apprised of the proceedings in Ravana’s court. She informed Sita that Ravana’s mother Kaikasi, had urged her son to restore Sita with due honour, to Rama. “But Ravana will listen to no one. Virtuous Sita, you must not let your confidence in Rama fail you. Very soon, he will defeat Ravana and take you back with him,” Sarama consoled Sita with these words.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">A grandfather’s advice</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, Lanka resonated with the sounds of kettledrums and conches. Rama’s forces were closing in on Lanka, and were close to the city’s outskirts. Ravana addressed his council of ministers reprimanding them for being intimidated by Rama’s supposed prowess. He reminded them of their own expertise and heroism. When Malyavan, Ravana’s maternal grandfather heard him speak with such confidence, he advised him. “It is wise to go for war if you are superior to your adversary in strength and skill. But if you see yourself losing, or if you are equally matched with your enemy, it is best, and in everyone’s interest, to make peace. You would be wise to restore Sita to Rama and make peace with him.”</p>
			<p>Ravana stubbornly persisted. Malyavan continued to address him, “Ravana, realize that you have immunity from death at the hands of gods, demons and yakshas. But you are now facing human beings, monkeys and bears against whom you are not protected. Do you not see several bad omens that we have been observing in Lanka for some time now? Give up your evil design while there is still time. Moreover, we firmly believe that Rama is none other than Vishnu in human form. So there is no way you can conquer him. Make peace with him, Ravana and save yourself and our people from certain death and destruction.”</p>
			<p>Ravana who was firmly rooted on the path of ruin scoffed at his grandfather and accused him of having joined forces with Rama. He then posted his ablest commanders at the four gates of Lanka to thwart the vanara army’s entrance into the city.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.8">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama’s message to Ravana </h2>
			<p>Rama, along with Lakshmana, Vibheeshana and Sugreeva climbed the vantage point on Mount Suvela to assess the happenings in Lanka. As they were surveying the environs of Lanka, Sugreeva spotted Ravana on the terrace of the tallest tower in the city. On sudden impulse, the vanara king took one long leap and landed on the terrace, taking Ravana by surprise. He knocked down Ravana’s crown and gave him a push. One moment Ravana was down; next moment he bounced back on his feet and took Sugreeva by his neck. The two wrestled for a while. Then as Ravana came closer, Sugreeva bounded back to Mount Suvela as the vanara brigade raised a war cry.</p>
			<p>Battle cries were heard in Lanka to the beating of drums and trumpets. However, before beginning an onslaught on Ravana’s forces, Rama sent Angada with a message to the Lord of Lanka. “Oh great sinner, your end is approaching. Rama is at your fort gate, ready to fight you. Haughty king, if you love your life, if you are repentant for your evil deed, restore Sita to him. Beg Rama’s forgiveness. He is merciful.”</p>
			<p>Angada continued to deliver Rama’s message to Ravana, “The choice is yours; either fight Rama and die in battle, or surrender to him and seek his mercy. But if we know you well, you would elect to fight. Bid your family and citizens farewell. Have a last look at your beautiful Lanka which you have ruined by sheer arrogance. Vibheeshana who is just and righteous will be crowned king.”</p>
			<p>Ravana became wrathful on hearing Angada’s words. He called out to his men and ordered: “Grab him and kill him!”</p>
			<p>As Ravana’s guards made to seize Angada, the monkey rose up in the sky. He lifted the two guards, one in each hand, soared high, and flung them down.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile the vanara army surrounded Lanka on all sides. Rama then allocated his forces to fight Ravana. He assigned a specific task to each of his stalwart vanara commanders.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.9">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The war begins</h2>
			<p>The battle between the two sides began in all ferocity. It raged unabated through the day and continued into the night. Horses galloped with riders and elephants marched with soldiers mounted on them. All kinds of weapons flew in every direction, each meeting its target. Soldiers who had fallen, cried loud in pain and agony. Lanka’s fertile, brown earth turned red with the blood bath. Both sides witnessed heavy loss of life.</p>
			<p>Angada took on Indrajit and overpowered him. He killed his charioteer and horses, wounded Indrajit and smashed his chariot. Fatigued from the onslaught, Ravana’s son disappeared from the battlefield. Angada was applauded by his vanara compatriots for defeating Indrajit. However, because Indrajit had been granted a boon by Brahma that he could become invisible at will, the enemy presumed he had fled the field in fear.</p>
			<p>Indrajit who was enfeebled by Angada, fumed and frothed at this insult. He remained invisible, and shot serpent darts at Rama and Lakshmana. The brothers who became bound by the darts, fell down and became immobile. Indrajit, who believed them to be dead, boasted about how he had successfully defeated and killed them. He then pierced all the other vanaras with his arrows and struck terror in the monkey camp. The vanaras too thought the Dasharatha siblings to be dead, and began to mourn them. Vibheeshana, however, consoled Sugreeva and the vanara force, and asked them not to despair, and remain optimistic. He asked them to protect the brothers until they regained consciousness. “Rest assured that Rama is not going to die. The brave and courageous sons of Dasharatha have only fainted. It is just a matter of time before they recover from the swoon.”</p>
			<p>Indrajit who was convinced he had killed Rama and Lakshmana, conveyed the news to Ravana. The king of Lanka was elated at his sons’s feat and hugged Indrajit. He then called Trijata the demoness who was guarding Sita in Ashoka Vana. He asked Trijata to convey to Sita the news of the death of Rama and Lakshmana. He also asked Trijata to take Sita on the Pushpaka Vimana for her to see their dead bodies. Trijata carried out Ravana’s orders. Sita was heartbroken when she saw Rama and Lakshmana lie ensnared, pierced by countless arrows and darts. She looked frail and wretched as she sobbed inconsolably.</p>
			<p>Trijata, the good-natured ogre, immediately reasoned with Sita. She convinced her that Rama and Lakshmana were unconscious, but not dead. “If indeed they were dead, there would be pell-mell among his army. But look there, the monkeys appear to be guarding the brothers. Why would anybody protect the dead? Look at the faces of the fallen heroes – there is no pallor in them to indicate death. Do you not see their faces radiate a spark? Trust me O princess of Mithila, I would not lie to you, for you have conquered me by your noble disposition. Rama and Lakshmana are invincible and even the combined forces of the gods and demons cannot vanquish them.” Sita prayed for Trijata’s words to be true.</p>
			<p>As Sugreeva and his army grieved over Rama and Lakshmana, Rama regained consciousness. When he rose and saw Lakshmana lie lifeless, disconsolate. “With my beloved brother gone, of what use would my very life be to me?”</p>
			<p>Rama felt devastated upon seeing Lakshmana lie inert, bathed in blood, arrows all over him. He felt defeated at the hands of destiny. He thanked Sugreeva and his army profusely for rendering him every possible help in locating Sita. He asked all of them to go their way since all was now lost.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.10">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Garuda to the rescue</h2>
			<p>As Sugreeva was pondering over the turn of events, they were interrupted by lightning and thunder. The sky was overcast with dense clouds and a strong gust of wind whipped up dust and fallen leaves in its wake. Uprooted trees fell into the sea causing alarm among the marine creatures. Suddenly, Garuda, the mount of Vishnu, appeared before them. When the serpents, in the form of arrows binding Rama and Lakshmana, saw their arch enemy Garuda approaching them, they immediately slithered away in fear. Garuda wiped the faces of Rama and Lakshmana, wished them good luck and embraced them. By the mere touch of Garuda, the brothers were restored their powers.</p>
			<p>As Garuda took leave of them, he cautioned them to remain vigilant against the ogres on the battle field. “They are treacherous by nature and will take recourse to devious means to win. Rama, you have done well to kill most of the males in Lanka, except for the aged and youngsters. You will succeed in vanquishing Ravana and getting Sita back.”</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.11">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The battle resumes</h2>
			<p>Once again there was jubilation in the monkey camp. A great battle followed. When Ravana lost his most capable contingent of warriors one after another, he himself appeared on the battlefield to face the enemy. It was a fierce clash of goliaths. Ravana struck the monkey force with thousands of arrows. Many of them lost their lives. The monkey brigade feared Ravana and sought shelter in Rama. Rama was ready with his bow to strike terror among the forces of Ravana. The heroic Lakshmana wanted to take on Ravana. Rama acceded to his request. He cautioned Lakshmana to be wary of the demon’s moves, keeping in mind his strengths and weaknesses. “Ever be alert, keep your eyes focused and defend yourself well with the weapons you wield,” Rama advised. The brothers embraced and Lakshmana marched ahead to confront Ravana.</p>
			<p>The battle between Ravana and Lakshmana raged relentlessly. Arrows flew in a continuous volley, wounding both of them. Ravana finally used the javelin that Brahma had presented to him. He sent it flying at Lakshmana. Though Lakshmana saw the weapon approach him and tried to counter it, the javelin had done the damage. It pierced Lakshmana on the chest and gravely wounded him.</p>
			<p>Hanuman who saw Lakshmana fall down unconscious, darted ferociously towards Ravana. He dealt the demon a heavy blow on his chest. As Ravana slumped to the ground, blood splattered from his ears, eyes and mouth. Hanuman picked up the unconscious Lakshmana and carried him to Rama. Soon enough, both, Lakshmana and Ravana regained consciousness and were ready for combat. Hanuman asked Rama to perch himself on his shoulder and fight the Lord of Lanka. As Rama rushed towards Ravana, he told the demon king that no matter which god or deity he approached, defeat and death at his hands was certain. “While you cannot escape from me after having offended me, your sons and grandsons will meet the same fate at the hands of Lakshmana.”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s anger increased several times on hearing Rama’s words. He hit Hanuman with arrows that were potentially more dangerous and harmful. When Rama saw the wounds on Hanuman, he was enraged. He smashed Ravana’s chariot, and then with a vengeance, shot an arrow at Ravana that pierced the demon’s chest. Ravana fainted from its impact. Rama asked Ravana to return to his palace, take rest and come back the following day to continue the battle.</p>
			<p>Ravana’s chariot was shattered to pieces. His horse and charioteer were killed. Rama had handled the situation in a judicious manner and added insult to injury. Ravana’s ego was hurt.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.12">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kumabhakarna </h2>
			<p>Ravana recalled the words of Brahma who had warned him against human beings. He recollected an event from the past. King Anaranya of the Ikshvaku lineage once cursed Ravana saying that one of his descendents would be the cause of his death in battle. “Perhaps, Rama is the one at whose hands I’m fated to die!”</p>
			<p>Ravana who was visibly shaken by this confrontation with Rama, recalled other incidents from the past. He had incurred the wrath of Goddess Uma. When Ravana once lifted Mount Kailasa, Uma cursed him saying that a woman would be the ultimate cause of his death. Nalakubera, the son of Kubera, and Brahma too, had cursed Ravana with death if he cast evil designs upon any woman. Ravana recalled another incident when he had ridiculed Nandiswara for resembling a monkey in looks. Nandiswara cursed Ravana saying that his destruction would be brought about by monkeys who would fight him in battle.</p>
			<p>Ravana summoned his ministers and asked them to wake up the slumbering Kumbhakarna. It was a tall task to wake up the sleeping giant before his due time. The demon who was ordained to sleep for six months at a stretch had gone to sleep barely a month ago. The ogres wondered how they would wake him up. They proceeded to his grand mansion located in a cave in the subterranean region. They carried with them humongous mounds of food, garlands and perfumes. When they entered his chamber they were greeted by the sounds of his sonorous snoring. The ogres staggered and stumbled as they were pushed by the force of the wind that blew from Kumbhakarna’s nostrils as he breathed. They tried to tickle his sense of smell and rouse him from sleep, using the aroma of meat and fragrance of flowers and incense. They played loudly on drums, trumpets and other musical instruments to wake him up. But to no avail. The ogres then beat, thrashed and struck him all over his body, tore at his hair, bit his ears and nose, hoping to awaken him.</p>
			<p>Finally Kumbhakarna woke up when a huge herd of elephants was made to walk over him as he lay stretched in sleep. Kumbhakarna woke up, unhurt. He roared, ravenous from hunger. He devoured enormous quantities of meat of different kinds. When his hunger was sated, he demanded to know the reason for being woken up. He proceeded to his brother’s palace when he was informed that Ravana had summoned him.</p>
			<p>The vanaras ran here and there in a chaotic manner upon seeing the gigantic figure of Kumbhakarna. He appeared menacing as he walked the streets of Lanka. Rama wished to know from Vibeeshana the identity of this massive ogre. Vibheeshana responded by telling Rama that he was one of Ravana’s brothers who had defeated Indra and Yama. Vibheeshana also gave Rama a brief history of Kumbhakarna. Kumbhakarna, the most gigantic of the ogres, had a voracious appetite, even as an infant. He would devour and digest, thousands of creatures. He once destroyed a tusk of Airavata, the celestial elephant of Indra. He then delivered a smarting blow to Indra. The gods including Indra feared that there would be no creatures left on earth if Kumbhakarna gobbled them at the rate he did. They approached Brahma for a solution to the threat posed by the colossus. Brahma cast a spell on Kumbhakarna to remain eternally buried in sleep. Ravana intervened on behalf of his brother. Brahma relented and modified his curse. He said that Kumbhakarna would sleep continuously for six months, following which he would enjoy one day of wakefulness.</p>
			<p>Ravana briefed Kumbhakarna about the heavy casualties his army had faced in battle. He urged his brother to take on Rama and the vanara forces. Ravana embraced his brother and adorned him with ornaments before the latter left for battle. Once again there were ill omens as the demon of massive proportions led his forces to battle.</p>
			<p>There was pell-mell among the bears and monkeys as Kumbhakarna struck terror in them by his mere presence. A stampede ensued among the monkey troops as they saw Kumbhakarna make towards them. Angada rebuked them saying that even their wives would scoff at them for being cowardly and beating retreat. The simians who felt ashamed on hearing Angada’s words, returned to fight, even if it meant dying in battle. They lifted mountains and peaks, uprooted huge trees and hurled them at Kumbhakarna. Ravana’s brother simply intercepted them all and split them with little effort, in mid air.</p>
			<p>The prodigious Hanuman, struck Kumbhakarna a powerful blow by lifting up a mammoth mountain peak and hurling it at him. The demon reeled under its impact and blood gushed from his body. He got up with redoubled vigour and dealt Hanuman a piercing punch with his sharp pike on his breast. The son of Vayu was rendered powerless. When the vanara army saw their most indomitable leader fall down injured, they once again began to withdraw from the arena. The mighty Nila, one of their principal commanders, restored their confidence. The monkeys relentlessly pounded Kumbhakarna with trees, crags, peaks and fists, but to no avail. Angada put up a courageous fight only to fall unconscious with injuries. The demon brother of Ravana was too powerful for the vanara force. They were killed in large numbers and greater numbers lay grievously wounded. They were gripped with fear as they saw some of their great leaders fall under Kumbhakarna’s brutal offensive. Sugreeva too fell senseless on the field. The ogre captured the fallen Sugreeva and started walking towards Lanka.</p>
			<p>Hanuman, who bounced back from Kumbhakarna’s ferocious blow, buoyed the sagging spirit of the warring monkeys. Meanwhile, Sugreeva recovered consciousness as he was being carried by Kumbhakarna on his back. The king of the monkeys, clawed at, and tore the demon’s ears and bit off his nose. Kumbhakarna who was writhing in pain, flung Sugreeva to the ground. As soon as Sugreeva hit the earth, he leaped into the air and joined hands with Rama, who now entered the battlefield, to fight Kumbhakarna.</p>
			<p>As the ogre of mammoth size began to devour the monkeys by the thousands, Lakshmana escalated his own confrontation with greater vigour and fury. Kumbhakarna now saw Lakshmana’s fighting skills and abilities in a new light, with more respect. Yet, he insisted on fighting Rama alone, and defeating him. His words reeked of arrogance as he said, “It is Rama alone I seek to fight and kill. When he is slayed, the entire vanara force will be destroyed.” Kumbhakarna then rushed towards Rama, raining a torrent of weapons on him. Rama countered these missiles with the bow of Rudra, rendering Kumbhakarna’s arsenal, powerless. When Kumbhakarna heard the twang of Rama’s bow, he lunged forward laughing hideously. He claimed he would devour Rama, as effortlessly as he had, members of the simian troop.</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana, who was seething with anger at Kumbhakarna’s words, charged ahead of Rama, to fight his elder brother. Kumbhakarna who saw his brother’s eagerness to fight him, addressed him with affection, “Beloved brother, you are the only one amongst us who has dared to stand on the side of truth and righteousness. You have sought Rama’s refuge and by his grace you will reign over Lanka. But for now, I who am engaged in battle and see neither friend nor foe, beg you to move away from my line of firing. For, I do not wish to kill you.”</p>
			<p>It wrenched Vibheeshana’s heart to hear his brother’s words. His eyes welled up with tears as he moved away from the line of action. He watched with an aching heart, the clash between his brother and Rama. A violent encounter followed. Kumbhakarna intercepted the missiles rained on him by Rama. The scion of Ikshvaku then axed the mighty demon’s right arm which bore semblance to a huge mountain peak in weight and magnitude. As his gargantuan arm fell down, it crushed thousands of monkeys under its weight. The surviving monkeys stood by their dead fellowmates and witnessed the most gruesome encounter between Rama and the demon. Rama soon severed Kumbhakarna’s left arm as the latter raised it to hurl a weapon at him. More vanaras lost their lives, crushed under the weight of the ogre’s second arm. Rama sheared off each limb of Kumbhakarna, and finally the valiant ogre’s head rolled down, chopped off by Rama’s missile. Several mansions, gates and defense walls of Lanka lay waste under the burden of the falling skull. There was great cheering among the gods, Gandharvas, sages and celestial beings as Kumbhakarna lay annihilated.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana’s grief </h2>
			<p>Ravana was beside himself with sorrow on hearing of Kumbhakarna’s death. Kumbhakarna, his right hand had fallen prey to Rama and the demon king of Lanka was certain his own end was near. “What shall I do with this kingdom, or with Sita, after you, my dear brother, have departed from this world!” he cried. “I do not even wish to remain alive any longer. I rue that I did not heed the sagely council of Vibheeshana. I have brought calamity upon myself and on our entire kinfolk, as he had rightly pointed out.”</p>
			<p>Trisira, a son of Ravana, was appalled to hear his father speak in defeated terms. He chided Ravana for wallowing in sorrow and self-pity. He goaded his father to pick himself up and resume fighting. He asked him not to feel overwhelmed by the situation and turn chicken-hearted which was most unbecoming of a king and warrior of his class. He instilled confidence in Ravana by recounting to him his skills and abilities, of his potent power with which he was capable of winning over the three worlds. Trisira, took it upon himself to defeat Rama. The spirits of the Ravana’s army was bolstered when they heard Trisira speak with such valour and courage. Ravana gave orders to Trisira, his other sons and brothers to prepare afresh for another campaign against Rama.</p>
			<p>The renewed struggle once again witnessed a terrible blood bath. Both sides suffered heavy loss of lives. The battle field had turned into a vast mound of debris, ridden with fallen mountains, uprooted trees and flesh and limbs of mortally wounded creatures. As the battle escalated to a feverish pitch, Angada, Nila and Hanuman, slayed the sons and brothers of Ravana, including the daring Trisira.</p>
			<p>The fall of Trisira, led Atikaya to take up cudgels on behalf of Ravana. Atikaya who has mastered the Vedas, equalled his father Ravana in might. He was proficient in the use of mystic missiles, a blessing that he had obtained by propitiating Brahma. Atikaya challenged Rama to a fight, whereupon Lakshmana stretched his bow to strike him. Atikaya who was arrogance personified, addressed Lakshmana: “You are still too young to fight me. I am invincible. You are no match for me, for I am Kaala, or Time itself. There is none who can overpower or kill me. If you cherish your life, retreat from battle and let Rama face me.”</p>
			<p>Lakshmana became furious on hearing Atikaya speak with such haughtiness. He shot back at him: “If you are as powerful as you claim, let your actions bespeak your skills. Just as a small-statured Vishnu covered all the three worlds in three strides, I too, though young, will deliver you to the abode of Yama.”</p>
			<p>The verbal altercations between Atikaya and Lakshmana, was followed by a deadly clash between them. According to a boon granted to Atikaya by Brahma, this son of Ravana could not be destroyed by any weapon except the missile presided over by Brahma. At the height of the fight between the stalwarts, the wind God appeared before Lakshmana and prompted him to use the Brahmastra on Atikaya. Lakshmana did as advised and severed the demon’s head.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Indrajit’s Brahmastra</h2>
			<p>Ravana grieved for Atikaya as he did for his other deceased sons and siblings. But he stubbornly stood his ground and expressed his desire to see the war through to its conclusion. He feared for the safety of Lanka and gave orders for greater fortification of the city, especially of Ashoka Vana where Sita was held captive.</p>
			<p>The young and spirited Indrajit, Ravana’s eldest and favourite son, boosted his father’s floundering spirits. He assured him that none could ever vanquish their lot so long as he, Indrajit himself, was alive. He bragged about his own skills on the basis of Indra’s exceptionally powerful arrows that he possessed. Indrajit prepared to confront Rama and Lakshmana after duly propitiating Agni, the God of Fire. He then made himself invisible and began systematic destruction of the vanara force. The monkeys stood firm and brave, facing Indrajit in invisible form and embracing death for Rama’s cause.</p>
			<p>The battle progressed. Indrajit invoked the dreaded Brahmastra. In order to show due respect to the potent weapon presided over by Brahma, Rama and Lakshmana willed themselves to be bound by it. When Indrajit saw the brothers had fallen and were lying motionless, he rejoiced and claimed victory over them. He left for Lanka to convey the joyous news to his father – of the defeat of the sons of Dasharatha at his hands.</p>
			<p>The entire vanara army despaired on seeing the heroes fallen. Vibheeshana, however, urged them to remain confident and courageous. He dispelled the fears they entertained by telling them that Rama and Lakshmana had opted to remain unconscious as a mark of respect to Brahma whose missile had been used by Indrajit to overpower and overwhelm them. Hanuman and Vibheeshana then set about comforting the injured among their troop. Jambavan, the wise bear also lay wounded in the clash. When he heard Hanuman’s voice he called out to him and said, “Hanuman, you alone can help the monkeys and our wounded vanara force in the war against Indrajit. You must use your insurmountable skills and fly out to the Sanjeevani Mountain to bring, four life-saving and medicinal herbs from there. These herbs are capable of restoring the dead to life, healing injuries and restoring the body to its original glory.”</p>
			<p>Hanuman felt inspired by Jambavan’s words and by the faith the elderly bear reposed in his abilities. The mighty Hanuman stood towering over the Trikuta Mountain, ready to take off on yet another mission that had been entrusted to him. One huge purge, and Hanuman was air borne, on his way to cover thousands of yojanas to reach the Himalayas. When the herbaceous plants saw Hanuman approach them, they hid themselves from his view! The resolute Hanuman, in his inimitable fashion, gave a tremendous roar and seized Sanjeevani Mountain with one swift movement of his hand. He carried the treasured peak to bring back to life his entire army of vanaras and bears. The fragrance from the herbs infused new life into the simian army and they resumed their battle against the ogres. Meanwhile, Ravana, as part of his war tactics, disposed off into the sea, the dead ogres belonging to his army. He did this to ensure that the enemy would not have a count of the remaining demons. They would therefore, not be able to gauge the strength of his army in terms of their numbers.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Makaraksa killed by Lakshmana</h2>
			<p>The army of monkeys re-entered Lanka with burning torches. The ogres who were positioned at the strategic gates of Lanka, fled upon seeing the rejuvenated monkey force. Meanwhile, the monkeys got busy destroying Lanka, setting fire to everything that came their way. Lanka was doused in fire. As the battle raged, Angada killed several of the ogre commanders. Kumba and Nikumba, sons of Kumbhakarna were killed by Sugreeva and Hanuman. When Ravana heard of their deaths, he ordered Khara’s son Makaraksa to fight the monkeys. All kinds of missiles were hurled and brave warriors on both sides met their bloody end. Many of the injured monkeys could not withstand the volley of weapons discharged by Makaraksa and his army. They fled the field in fear. When Rama noticed his vanara force run helter-skelter, he intercepted the hail of shafts that flew from the enemy camp. An overconfident and conceited Makaraksa, challenged Rama to fight him. He bragged that it was only a matter of time before he made mincemeat of Rama. He dared Rama, eager to avenge the death of his father at Janasthana. A close encounter followed between them. As Rama twanged his bow, its sound reverberated throughout the battlefield like a loud thunderclap. All the heavenly beings watched the combat as the titans inflicted deep gashes on each other. Rama soon killed Makaraksa’s charioteer and shattered his chariot to pieces. Makaraksa who was incensed by this, flung his pike at Rama. In a split second, Rama smashed the demon’s pike into several pieces. Makaraksa charged at Rama like an enraged bull. The son of Dasharatha used his all-powerful weapon on the demon. It pierced Makaraksa’s heart and tore it asunder; life soon ebbed out of the youngster.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.16">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Lakshmana slays Indrajit</h2>
			<p>Ravana and Indrajit had elaborate consultation following the fall of Makaraksa. Ravana commanded Indrajit to take on Rama and Lakshmana in battle, maintaining visible or invisible form. Indrajit offered oblations to the fire and after performing the necessary rituals, left for war. With his extraordinary strength and skill he had conquered even Indra in combat and had never lost a war. “These sons of Dasharatha are mere mortals. I shall easily destroy them and win this war for my father”, Indrajit said to himself. He immediately assumed an invisible form and proceeded to the battlefield. Arrows, spears and missiles rained down upon Rama’s army. Lakshmana sought to put an end to Indrajit by using the mystic missile of Brahma upon him. Rama reprimanded him for the rash action, saying, “It is not fair to destroy the entire army of rakshasas by using this potent missile, when it is Indrajit who fights us by making himself invisible. Let us, in unison, bring all our other weapons to bear upon him and destroy him.”</p>
			<p>The shrewd Indrajit divined the brothers’ intentions. He immediately used his conjuring skills to good effect. He created an illusory image of Sita and placed it on his chariot. He then directed his army of ogres to surround the chariot and wield weapons at ‘Sita’. It was his intention to hoodwink Rama and Lakshmana into believing Sita had been killed by them. Indrajit put his plan to action when he saw the monkey force rush towards his chariot. He pulled Sita by her hair and struck her hard. Sita, pained by the blow and tug at her hair, called out to Rama to rescue her. Hanuman’s heart bled when he saw the brutality that Indrajit inflicted upon her. He began a tirade against Indrajit and rushed at him. The simian troop followed him. As Hanuman looked on in horror, Indrajit split the illusory Sita, asunder. Hanuman was struck with grief and he rushed towards the enemy force with murderous intent and ferocity. He hurled a huge rock upon Indrajit’s chariot. The charioteer who saw the rock coming rode the vehicle to safety. Nevertheless, thousands of ogres lay crushed under the rock as it hit ground. The monkeys felt encouraged by Hanuman’s act. They darted towards Indrajit. The vanaras created havoc in the battlefield. Hanuman then proceeded to meet Rama to inform him of Sita’s demise at the hands of Indrajit.</p>
			<p>Rama fainted on hearing of Sita’s tragic end. Lakshmana consoled him and prepared himself to kill Indrajit and avenge Sita’s death. However, when Vibheeshana heard the news, he immediately restored order in Rama’s army and turned his attention to Lakshmana and Rama who had fallen down unconscious. He informed the brothers that Sita could not be dead and it was nothing but magic performed by Indrajit. Vibeeshana allayed Rama’s fears by saying, “It is merely an illusion that Indrajit has created to cause chaos among our forces. I beseech you Rama, to please send Lakshmana to fight Indrajit and put an end to him.”</p>
			<p>Vibheeshana continued talking to Rama, “Indrajit has gone to Nikumbhila sanctuary to perform a pre-war ritual and pour oblations into the fire. According to a boon that he has been granted by Brahma, if he is allowed to conclude this ritual successfully, no force on earth can destroy him. It is only wise that you immediately dispatch Lakshmana to kill Indrajit before he offers oblations to the fire deity.”</p>
			<p>As Rama, Lakshmana and the vanara forces proceeded to Nikumbhila, Vibheeshana spelled out a course of action for Rama to follow to bring Indrajit out of his invisible form. Rama and his army acted upon Vibheeshana’s plan and began to shower arrows upon the demon army so that at least some of them would hit their invisible target – Indrajit. Lanka was in the throes of a great battle that saw weapons race with great speed in every direction. The demons grew desperate as the monkeys bombarded them with massive crags and massifs. Indrajit’s army became dispirited with the onslaught by the vanaras. When Indrajit was informed of this, he was so troubled that he abandoned the rites midway, to join the battle, without concluding the ritual he had begun. When the rakshasa force saw Indrajit’s preparedness to resume fighting, they hovered around him. Hanuman immediately uprooted a gargantuan tree and flung it at the charging demons, creating havoc among them. A vicious clash of the rival armies followed. Indrajit rode on his chariot right in front of Hanuman and rained weapons upon him. As Hanuman and Indrajit were engaged in a scuffle, Vibheeshana directed Lakshmana to slay Indrajit as the latter hastened to kill Hanuman. He also pointed out to Lakshmana, a banyan tree where Indrajit would offer oblations to the fire spirit. “Act fast, Lakshmana,” Vibheeshana spurred him. “Intercept him now, before he pours the oblations into the fire. This is your only chance to overpower and kill him. Hurry O Lakshmana before he reaches the banyan tree.”</p>
			<p>Lakshmana immediately challenged Indrajit to a duel. Indrajit noticed Vibheeshana standing next to Lakshmana when he accepted Lakshmana’s challenge. Indrajit rebuked his uncle and scorned at him for being disloyal to his own kinsman and joining hands with the enemy. Vibheeshana reiterated his stand to Indrajit, recounting Ravana’s misdeeds: “Your father has done everything possible to ensure doom for himself. He had mindlessly slaughtered seers, forcefully carried another man’s wife and coveted what is not rightfully his. I abandoned him for these very reasons only after advising him on a number of occasions against pursuing these evils designs. Unfortunately, your end today is certain, and nothing, or no one can change that!”</p>
			<p>A titanic battle ensued between Indrajit who rode on a chariot, and Lakshmana who was perched on Hanuman’s back. It was a fight between equals. As soon as Vibheeshana sensed Indrajit was becoming desperate, he advised Lakshmana to strike him. Lakshmana acted with great speed. He first slayed Indrajit’s charioteer and then smashed the chariot to pieces. Finally he severed Indrajit’s head.</p>
			<p>The heavens rejoiced at Indrajit’s fall. There was music, dance and merriment accompanied by bands and other musical instruments. Victory cries reverberated throughout the city. Rama felt elated at Lakshmana’s accomplishment. All the injured vanaras were treated with the herbs and healed.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana’s rage</h2>
			<p>Ravana felt shattered on hearing of Indrajit’s death at the hands of Lakshmana. Nothing mattered to him any more. His fury amplified and he desired to avenge his son’s death and that of all his kinsmen. He brandished his sword and made towards Ashoka Vana. He loudly announced to his ministers that he would seek his revenge by killing Sita. Sita trembled with fear when she saw a blood-thirsty Ravana approach her, sword in hand and fibrillating with malevolent energy. She wondered, “Is it that he has come to kill me because I have not surrendered to his obnoxious desire? Could it be that he has killed my beloved Rama and is now here to make me his consort! I guess I deserve this punishment for not having heeded the noble Hanuman’s wise counsel. Did he not offer to carry me on his back and unite me with Rama? Had I listened to him, I would not have had to see these days! Mother Kausalya would be devastated to know that her only son is dead, killed by Ravana.” As Sita continued to lament she cursed Manthara for having been the root cause of all her troubles and misery, and that of Dasharatha’s family.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, the good natured Suparswa, an upright and wise minister in Ravana’s court, advised Ravana against slaying Sita. “Is it righteous for a younger brother of Kubera to kill a woman? Show your ire upon Rama alone, by challenging him to a fight. Do not malign yourself further by destroying Sita.”</p>
			<p>Ravana heeded Suparswa’s judicious counsel and walked back to his palace.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.18">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Daring vanaras</h2>
			<p>The clash between the vanaras and demons continued ruthlessly. There was blood and gore everywhere and large parts of Lanka lay in ruins. The ogres went about hitting and killing everyone. Rama too was uncompromising. He destroyed the enemies’ chariots, elephants, horses, demons and all. The rakshasa who were so overwhelmed by Rama’s vicious assault upon them, cursed Soorpanakha for having incited and instigated Ravana to kidnap Sita and face the consequences of such an ignominious act. After all, was it not Soorpanakha who had egged Ravana on this path of destruction, to achieve her own end! The ogres recalled several instances that testified to Rama’s supreme power and invincibility. Did Rama not single-handedly kill the monstrous Viradha and other mighty warriors and demons? Rama had dealt with so many of them, all alone. Were these deaths not enough to knock sense into Ravana and prompt him to restore Sita to Rama? If only our king had done this, Rama would have forgiven him. It would have ended the hostilities between them and we would have been spared this battle and bloodshed. If only Ravana had heeded Vibheeshana’s and Kumbhakarna’s wise counsel, we would not be facing misery and destruction today. The rakshasas wailed ruefully as they undoubtedly acknowledged Rama’s supreme powers.</p>
			<p>The ogres bemoaned the loss of their dear and near ones in a needless battle brought on by Ravana’s impiety, arrogance and obstinacy. They recalled Shiva’s promise to the gods when they sought his protection against the brutality of Ravana and his demons. “Did Shiva not tell the gods that a woman would bring about Ravana’s downfall and thereby redeem them from the demons? Sita is that woman because of whom we will be wiped out! We have nowhere to go, nobody to turn to. Vibheeshana was indeed wise to join hands with Rama,” the demons spoke amongst themselves and felt sorry for the fate that had befallen them.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-6.19">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana joins the war</h2>
			<p>Ravana heard these laments from every home in Lanka. He was unperturbed. He instructed his men to march to the battle arena and vanquish Rama. He vowed to avenge the death of his brothers and sons. The entire Universe trembled as Ravana thundered down the streets of Lanka on his chariot, crossed the city gates and rode towards Rama. As he exited from the northern gate to confront his foe, the sun went down the horizon and darkness enveloped the city. There were omens portending misfortune -- a meteor fell from the skies, and clouds rained blood; crows and vultures emitted piercing and eerie cries while dogs howled. But Ravana marched forward, headstrong, claiming that Rama would not live to see the rising sun.</p>
			<p>The vanara forces scattered and ran in all directions, felled by Ravana’s missiles. Sugreeva rallied around them, reminding them of their noble cause. He seized a mammoth tree and armed with it, wrought untold destruction upon Ravana’s army. He rained rocks on them causing them to crush under the weight of these boulders. Virupaksha, the demon commander of extraordinary power, mounted an elephant and attacked Sugreeva. A fierce war followed. Virupaksha’s mount fell with a thud. The demon alighted from it and lunged upon Sugreeva. They fought like true warriors, falling down now and bouncing back in an instant. In a swift movement, Sugreeva struck Virupaksha on his temple bone, and killed him instantaneously. One by one, the stalwarts in Ravana’s army fell in battle, defeated by Sugreeva and his forces. Angada killed Mahaparswa, one of the last among Ravana’s most brilliant commanders.</p>
			<p>With the fall of Mahaparswa, Ravana fought with redoubled vigour. Arrows and missiles covered the sky as Rama and Ravana confronted each other with their forces. Lakshmana fumed with fury as Ravana sent flurries of darts at Rama. He severed the head of Ravana’s charioteer and smashed to bits, the demon king’s bow. Vibheeshana struck down with his mace, the horses reined to Ravana’s chariot. A beleaguered Ravana, who was now without his charioteer, leaped out of his vehicle. His face turned crimson and his eyes were blood shot with ire. He flung a sharp and pointed lance, poisoned at its tip, at Vibheeshana. But fortunately for Vibheeshana, Lakshmana intercepted it and split it into shards. The son of Dasharatha then ran towards Vibheeshana to protect him from the volley of arrows that Ravana hurled upon him. Ravana became furious and yelled at Lakshmana: “You chit of a mortal! I will kill you this very instant with my javelin which is infallible.” The potent javelin was especially designed by the demon Maya for Ravana. The king of Lanka aimed it at Lakshmana’s chest. The speed and force with which Ravana threw the weapon, it not only pierced Lakshmana’s chest, but went through his body and into the earth and the Ikshvaku prince fell to the ground.</p>
			<p>Rama’s eyes welled up with tears as he saw Lakshmana fall to the ground, unconscious and bathed in blood. As he embraced his beloved brother, Rama asked Hanuman, Sugreeva and the rest of the vanara forces to stand guard over him while he himself fought Ravana. The combat between them gathered momentum and an assortment of weapons were employed. Ravana fled in fear when Rama closed in upon him.</p>
			<p>Rama then turned his attention to Lakshmana who was lying motionless in a pool of blood, struggling to keep himself alive. Once again Rama was overcome by sorrow and wept bitterly. “Of what use would victory against Ravana be if I am to lose my beloved Lakshmana? Perhaps, with difficulty one may find a spouse as pious and chaste as Sita, but where would I find a brother such as Lakshmana! Without doubt I too shall give up my life if my dear brother were to depart from this world. What will I tell his mother Sumitra who dotes on him? How will I console her? O Lakshmana, warrior of exceptional skills, why do you lie so motionless, without even blinking an eyelid? Look at me, talk to me, dear brother! Open your eyes, wake up!”</p>
			<p>Susena, a prime commander of the vanara force comforted Rama by telling him that Lakshmana was far from dead. He convinced Rama that his brother was alive, by pointing to the various vital bodily signs he observed in him. Once Rama regained his composure, Susena asked Hanuman to make haste and procure the life-saving herbs from the Mahodaya Mountains. Without delay, Hanuman swiftly proceeded to Mahodaya Mountain and returned in good time with huge chunks of the mountain containing the herbs. Lakshmana was restored to life and healed.</p>
			<p>Rama embraced his sibling and held him close to his bosom, happy to see him spring back to life. Lakshmana immediately reminded Rama of his pledge to annihilate Ravana. He gently chided his older brother for displaying despondency and giving way to despair. “It is out of character for a prince of your stature and calibre to show such weakness in the face of slight adversity. It is high time you killed Ravana and rescued Mother Sita,” Lakshmana urged Rama.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana’s spirited talk inspired Rama to resume his battle against Ravana.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Indra sends his chariot to Rama</h2>
			<p>Once again there was a relentless shower of armaments on the combat zone. Heaven and earth were lit up in flames and the earth was drenched in blood. The gods and demigods who witnessed the violence below from their celestial abodes expressed concern at the ill-matched combat. They found it unfair that while Rama stood on the ground, he faced Ravana who fought from his chariot. Indra immediately summoned his charioteer Matali. “Take my chariot and serve Rama as charioteer in the war against the demon king of Lanka”, he ordered. Indra also sent with Matali, his own bow, arrows, armour and spike for Rama to wield against Ravana and gain victory him.</p>
			<p>As Matali descended from the heavenly world to the battleground, he stood before Rama and conveyed Indra’s message to him and handed over the special arms to him. The goliaths, well matched in all respects, were now poised for an epoch-making battle. To the beating of war drums and blaring of trumpets, Rama and Ravana confronted each other in violent combat. Ravana shot thousands of arrows at Rama, pierced Matali with several shafts, struck the horses and tore apart Indra’s chariot with a single arrow, bringing down its ensign. The seers, sages and divine beings agonized at Rama’s plight. He was so overpowered by the continuous and aggressive assault upon him by Ravana, that he could barely fit the arrows to his bow! The gods kept cheering Rama, goading him to return triumphant in the encounter. Ravana maintained the momentum of his blitz on Rama. He pulled out one of his unassailable and most potent darts that was capable of annihilating all enemies at one stroke. Ravana’s army was delighted to see their king raise the weapon against Rama. Ravana addressed Rama with great scorn and arrogance, “This most powerful dart will see you and your brother reach Yama’s abode this very instant!”</p>
			<p>Ravana gave a revolting laugh as he shot the dart at Rama. The weapon came hurtling forward with great velocity, making a deafening sound in its wake. Rama strung his bow with several arrows to intercept the deadly shaft, but to no avail. When Rama saw that his weapons were consumed by the gigantic spear sent by Ravana, he decided to use Indra’s celebrated javelin which Matali had handed over to him. As the lance darted from the hands of Rama, a brilliant molten of lightning lit up the skies. Within moments, it split Ravana’s fearful pike into myriad fragments and rendered it impotent. Rama then sent a barrage of arrows at Ravana which pierced him all over his body. Ravana was exhausted and felt stinging pain on his sides where the spears and pikes had struck him. He bellowed savagely in pain, anger and fear. He continued to fling all kinds of projectiles at Rama, who remained unflinching when struck by these missiles.</p>
			<p>Rama addressed Ravana in a voice that was laced with sarcasm. “Yes, you are indeed a hero as you consider yourself to be, having carried away another’s wife. You are undoubtedly a champion who whisked away a woman who was alone, helpless and unguarded. You should be ashamed of this heinous act, for having transgressed all moral codes and ethics. Today you shall aptly bear the fruits of all your gallant deeds.”</p>
			<p>Rama continued his onslaught of missiles at Ravana with reinforced vehemence. The monkeys were buoyed by Rama’s spirits and they felled Ravana with rocks and crags. The Lankan king who was shelled by a torrent of weapons and huge objects from all sides, became dazed and confused. He was unable to think clearly and use the appropriate weapons on his enemy. Ravana’s charioteer who perceived the king’s befuddled state of mind, secretly led him away from the arena. Ravana became enraged at his charioteer’s furtive action. He rebuked him with harsh words: “Why have you brought this ignominy upon me? Why did you, in such a surreptitious manner whisk me away from the battleground? Upon whose orders did you do this? Do you think I am a coward to run away from the attack of a mere mortal? Or is it that you have sold yourself to my enemy because you think I have become powerless and inefficient to defend myself?”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s charioteer patiently heard out the king’s outburst. He then responded to Ravana’s verbal volley by telling him that it was sheer affection for the king that made him withdraw from the field. “Oh king, you were extremely fatigued from the fight and were in no position to overcome your adversary. Your horses too were completely exhausted. There were ill omens that did not auger well for you to continue the combat. And above all else, is it not my responsibility as your charioteer, to assess the circumstances prevailing and then make a move in your best interests?”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Aditya Hridayam</h2>
			<p>Ravana was satisfied with his charioteer’s explanation. He returned to confront Rama. Meanwhile Rama too was exhausted from the gruesome encounter with the demon king. As he stood surveying the situation and pondered over his next move, sage Agasthya appeared on the scene. He advised Rama to recite the supremely powerful and immortal ‘Adithya Hridayam,’ an ode to the Sun god. “This prayer propitiates Lord Brahma who is present in the orb of the Sun. Victory will certainly be yours my child, if you chant these verses. Prayer to the Sun God who is an embodiment of all gods, will enable you to conquer all your enemies,” Agasthya explained to Rama.</p>
			<p>Rama, heeded the words of the sage and prayed to the Sun god with due reverence and was all set with renewed vigor for a fresh conflict with the demon. As Ravana’s grand and mighty chariot flew out of the gates of Lanka towards Rama, the scion of Ikshvaku cautioned Matali. He asked him to be on guard and negotiate the chariot in a manner that would allow Rama to attack his opponent from a vantage point. Rama added, “My apologies to you Matali, for making these suggestions. I am aware of your high caliber and capability, and hence do not need to tell you what to do. Yet, I counsel you for I am extremely excited and agitated about vanquishing Ravana.”</p>
			<p>Matali was pleased to hear Rama’s words. He deftly rode the chariot towards Ravana who hailed a torrent of arrows at Rama. Though Rama’s anger was provoked by this barrage of weapons, he acted with patience and intelligence. He pulled out Indra’s bow and arrows of extraordinary impulse and speed, and directed them at Ravana. The celestial beings gathered together in the skies to witness the fight, and waited and prayed for Ravana’s defeat. Ravana’s camp observed several foreboding signs while the vanara army saw propitious omens. As the combat headed to its climactic stage, Rama returned blow for blow and tore apart the ensign and flag of Ravana’s chariot. A veritable second sky was created by the fearsome collision of weapons that illuminated the space between earth and heaven. As Ravana’s spears stung Matali, Rama turned livid with rage. He sent a stream of darts against the demon. The duel between the goliaths continued unceasingly through day and night.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana vanquished</h2>
			<p>Rama shot a serpentine arrow at Ravana, chopping off his head, only to find another take its place! As Rama severed Ravana’s newly grown head, another sprung up in its place! This went on endlessly and left Rama ruffled. He wondered at the efficacy of his weapons which had, on earlier occasions, effectively destroyed so many ogres.</p>
			<p>At this juncture, Matali reminded Rama to use the Brahmastra to vanquish Ravana. He said, “The hour of Ravana’s doom as prophesized by the gods has arrived. It is time, O noble Rama, for you to use this most powerful weapon upon him.”</p>
			<p>Rama immediately pulled out the Brahmastra that was gifted to him by sage Agasthya. He aimed it at Ravana. The weapon emitted a fiery flame as it sped with lightning speed towards the king of Lanka. It pierced his chest and shattered it. Ravana’s bow slipped from his hand. He gave a terrifying shriek and with a final cry of despair, fell down, dead. Ravana was vanquished.</p>
			<p>All the Devas, gods and sages rejoiced at Rama’s victory and showered flowers upon him. There was great jubilation among the vanaras.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana’s death lamented</h2>
			<p>While the vanara force felt intoxicated with joy, a pall of gloom enveloped Lanka as the ogres wailed for their fallen emperor. There were heart-wrenching cries in the city as its people mourned their illustrious king, who had brought destruction upon himself. Vibheeshana burst into tears on seeing his brother lie cold upon the bare earth, soaked in blood. “O beloved brother, you who were so learned, have met such an end! It pains me greatly to see you sprawled lifeless, rid of all glory and splendour! Why, dear brother, did you not heed my words, as I begged, beseeched and even admonished you, to give up the path of dishonor that you were treading upon?”</p>
			<p>As Vibheeshana grieved for the departed soul, Rama consoled him saying, “Ravana lies defeated, not because he lacked valour or courage. He has reaped the consequences of his sins and has met his end for the good of the world. He fought like a true warrior and therefore should not be mourned. We have accomplished our objective. It is only right that you perform his last rites as ordained by the scriptures.”</p>
			<p>Ravana’s numerous consorts burst into loud wails, beating their chests and rolling on the ground. Mandodari, his queen agonized over his death. Even in grief she reasoned, “It is hard to believe that you, who remained undefeated by all gods including Indra, have met your end, at the hands of a mere mortal! I am convinced that it is Lord Vishnu himself in human form, helped by a pantheon of gods in monkey and bear forms, who has put you to eternal sleep. Did you not realize this fact when your brother Khara was killed single-handedly by Rama? How is it that you did not perceive it to be the handiwork of Vishnu when a mere monkey came to Lanka looking for Sita and left it, devastated?”</p>
			<p>Mandodari was visibly shattered by her husband’s death. She continued to lament, recollecting instances from the recent past. “You invited death by abducting Sita and casting evil designs on her. Did you not realize that her piety and chastity are an embodiment of fire that would consume you? Are some of your consorts not more beautiful than Sita! You were so smitten by her that you chose to remain stubborn even though Vibheeshana, Kumbhakarna, your grandfather and I pleaded with you on several occasions not to indulge in this act of adharma!”</p>
			<p>None could stop Mandodari’s outpourings as she continued, “I was proud of the three exceptional men in my life; you my husband, Maya my father, and Indrajit my son. All you glorious stalwarts, have now left me alone and gone to your graves. The curse of every woman who has been widowed because of you has brought about my widowhood.” Mandodari fell upon her husband’s inert body, weeping uncontrollably.</p>
			<p>Rama then ordered Vibheeshana to perform Ravana’s obsequies. Vibheeshana expressed his reluctance to complete the last rites to one who had strayed from the path of dharma. “Though I love him dearly as my brother, I have no respect for him. He tread the path of evil, aspired to make another’s wife his own and needlessly brought harm upon several thousands of good souls. How can I perform his funeral rites?” Vibheeshana addressed Rama in all humility.</p>
			<p>“Death ends all feelings of hatred and acrimony,” Rama told Vibheeshana. “Your brother was brave and valiant and was never known to have been defeated in any battle. I have emerged victor and you have made contributions to this. It is only right that I show you my gratitude by guiding you to do what is right and befitting. In death, he is as much mine as he is yours. Our task has been accomplished and the onus rests on you to conduct the ceremonial rites for your brother’s final journey. The world will sing your glory for upholding the tenets of dharma.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vibheeshana’s coronation </h2>
			<p>Vibheeshana performed Ravana’s rites as advised by Rama. Matali ascended to his abode in the heavens after Rama expressed his profuse gratitude to him and to his master, Indra and bid him farewell. Rama then embraced Sugreeva for the tireless and unfailing assistance he had rendered along with his vanara force. The son of Dasharatha then called upon Lakshmana to make preparations for Vibheeshana’s installation to the throne of Lanka. With due pomp and pageantry, Vibheeshana assumed kingship of Lanka.</p>
			<p>At Rama’s instance, Hanuman sought Vibheeshana’s permission to proceed to Ashoka Vana to convey to Sita the happy news of Rama’s triumph over Ravana. Tears flowed down Sita’s face when she heard of Rama’s victory. She looked at Hanuman in stunned silence, unable to express her joy. When she regained her composure she thanked the son of Vayu and praised him for the huge role he played in Rama’s success against Ravana. Hanuman, with folded palms and head bowed, sought Sita’s permission to kill all the female demons surrounding her. After all, had they not terrorized her and caused her immense misery!</p>
			<p>Sita who was full of compassion, gently admonished Hanuman for wanting revenge. She said, “No. Noble son of Vayu, it does not befit you to kill them. They had only discharged their duty as ordered by their king. Now that he is dead, they will not harm me. Moreover, are you not aware of the age-old adage that was in reality spoken by a bear to a tiger? It runs thus, a man of superior virtues does not retaliate in a sinful manner, towards one who commits offence. It is not for the virtuous, to return evil for evil. The good and righteous, embellish themselves with right conduct even in the face of adversity and wickedness.”</p>
			<p>Sita rose still further in Hanuman’s esteem when he heard her loving words. He took leave of her saying that she would soon see her beloved Rama.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sita faces the fire ordeal</h2>
			<p>At Rama’s behest, Vibheeshana met Sita at Ashoka Vana and informed her that she would soon be in the presence of Rama. He asked her to prepare herself appropriately for the occasion. In the meantime, Vibheeshana readied a majestic palanquin to carry Sita from Ashoka Vana. As he announced Sita’s arrival, Rama was overcome by an avalanche of mixed emotions. He was joyous and despondent in equal measure upon seeing his dear Sita who had lived for so long in the abode of a demon.</p>
			<p>The monkeys and demons watched in fascination as Sita alighted from the palanquin and turned towards her beloved.</p>
			<p>As she walked towards him, head bent low, Rama’s heart swelled with love for this adorable lady who had been separated from him and had undergone untold suffering. Yet, when he spoke, his words were bereft of all emotion, and in fact, had a steely edge to them. “I have avenged your abduction and have rescued you from Ravana’s evil intents. But you have lived in another man’s dwelling for so long. How can I take back such a woman?”</p>
			<p>Sita felt her heart pierced by a thousand arrows when she heard Rama’s harsh words, uttered in the presence of all those assembled. Head still bent down, Sita addressed Rama in angry tones: “How is it that you speak to me in a manner that a common man would adopt towards an ordinary woman? Do you doubt my fidelity towards you? Is it that I willed myself to be carried away by the demon? Do you not believe that I became a victim of fate? Do you not believe that my mind and heart which alone are under my control, forever utter your name and have craved only for you? By speaking to me in this manner, you not only insult and pain me, but cast aspersions on my very character!”</p>
			<p>Sita turned to Lakshmana and asked him to kindle a fire so that she could enter it to prove her chastity. Rama remained silent. The fire was prepared. Sita first circumambulated her husbad Rama who had disowned her and then approached the blazing fire.</p>
			<p>She joined her palms in salutation to Agni and all the gods and addressed them in turn.</p>
			<p>“My heart never parts from Rama. Even if Rama does not know this truth, surely Oh Agni, the witness of the world, you know it.”</p>
			<p>“In act, thought and speech, I’ve always been faithful to Rama. Even if Rama does not know this truth, surely Oh Agni, the witness of the world, you know it.”</p>
			<p>“Oh Surya, Oh Chandra, Oh Vayu, Oh devas of four directions, Oh devas of the day-time and the twilights and the night, and Oh Mother Earth, you are all witnesses to what I am, though Rama has turned blind to my virtues”</p>
			<p>“Oh Agni the very embodiment of purity, I seek refuge in you.”</p>
			<p>As she went around the fire, the sages, gods, and the gandharvas gathered to witness Sita who was as pure as the sacrificial fire, seek refuge in that very element.</p>
			<p>The assembly of gods, demi-gods, celestial beings, demons, people and vanaras, waited with bated breath to witness the truth. Sita, the epitome of virtue and righteousness, remained a picture of divine charm as she entered the blazing fire. For a moment, Rama was forgotten and all eyes remained fixed on Sita. She glowed with purity and serenity as she sought to become one with fire.</p>
			<p>The congregation was unable to witness Sita’s ordeal. They closed their eyes tight until they heard the divine voice of Agni. Now all eyes turned towards Agni who appeared in all his splendour with Sita alongside him. “Oh Rama, behold your Sita, who is as pure as ever. Sin cannot even touch this blessed lady who remains untainted of mind and body. I hereby order you to accept Sita with every honour due her!” Rama, his eyes brimming with tears rejoiced on hearing the fire god’s words, even as Agni led Sita to him. The assembled crowd shouted in joy, “Hail Mother Sita, Glory be to her!”</p>
			<p>Rama, who had appeared to be as hard as diamond a short while ago, now appeared to be as soft as a flower. His eyes welled with tears of joy. In a voice trembling with emotion, Rama spoke to Sita as he held her close to him.“Did I not know of your pure heart and mind, Sita? I knew in my heart, you are ever pure; but I wanted the whole world to know it. Now, no one can ever point a finger at my beloved, merely because she resided in the abode of Ravana! Come dear, your ordeals are over. Let us return to Ayodhya and join our loved ones.”</p>
			<p>There was much joy and merriment as Sita was reunited with Rama. But amidst all this rejoicing, Rama did not forget his vanara friends. He beseeched Indra to bring all the vanaras killed or maimed in battle, back to life and good health. Indra who acquiesced Rama’s request, restored the vanquished monkeys and bears to life.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama’s coronation</h2>
			<p>Rama had accomplished his task of annihilating Ravana. He duly oversaw Vibheeshana installed as king of Lanka. He now prepared to leave for Ayodhya as he had successfully completed his fourteen-year-term in exile. Rama politely declined Vibheeshana’s invitation to prolong his stay in Lanka and partake of his hospitality. “I do not wish to delay my departure to Ayodhya because I am restless to see Bharata. I can barely wait to meet my dear brother,” Rama responded.</p>
			<p>The prince of Ayodhya thanked Vibheeshana profusely for his kindness and for being a most gracious host. However, since Rama wanted to reach Ayodha in quick time, he accepted Vibheeshan’s offer of travelling to his kingdom by the Pushpaka Vimana, known for its incredible speed. Vibheeshana, Hanuman, Sugreeva and the entire vanara force expressed their ardent desire to accompany the princes to Ayodhya to behold the spectacular sight of Rama being crowned king. Rama who was overjoyed at this, gladly agreed to their request.</p>
			<p>Together with Sita and Lakshmana, Rama ascended the Pushpaka Vimana, followed by the rest of their entourage. As the aerial car sped towards its destination, Rama pointed out to Sita the various spots where they had searched for her and how at each place he and Lakshmana had faced and destroyed ogres. En route, they made a brief halt at sage Bharadwaja’s ashram to enquire after his welfare and that of the citizens of Ayodhya.</p>
			<p>As they approached Ayodhya Rama asked Hanuman to convey the news of his imminent arrival to his cherished friend Guha. He also wanted Hanuman to proceed to his capital to learn of the welfare of its people, to know if they were happy under Bharata’s stewardship. Rama asked Hanuman to apprise Bharata of all the events that had happened after Bharata’s departure from Chitrakoota. Rama also asked Hanuman to observe Bharata’s attitude, gestures, responses, reactions and facial expressions as he narrated Rama’s trials and tribulations while in exile.</p>
			<p>Rama confessed to Hanuman, “It is easy to become addicted to fame and fortune. Who would not want to covet such a kingdom as Kosala, which is endowed with abundant wealth? It is possible that having ruled the empire for so many years, Bharata now aspires to be its sovereign. If that is true, I would only be too delighted to see him as king of Kosala. It is important for me to know Bharata’s mind, Hanuman. Make haste and report to me, my brother’s state of mind and that of my people.”</p>
			<p>Hanuman first met Guha and informed him of Rama’s return. He left Guha dancing and crying in joy upon hearing such good tidings. Within a stone’s throw from Ayodhya, Hanuman beheld Bharata, an emaciated figure, steeped in misery at having been parted from his beloved Rama. Hanuman observed that he lived like an ascetic, with matted locks, dressed in bark garments with skin of a black antelope tied around his waist. It was apparent that Bharata survived on fruits and roots alone and practiced austerities that only great seers undertook. When Hanuman approached him and told him that Rama was only a few miles away from him and Ayodhya, tears welled in his eyes and Bharata fainted, overwhelmed with joy. As soon as he recovered from the swoon and gained composure, Hanuman related Rama’s story to him. Bharata heard him with deep anguish and shed copious tears as Hanuman recounted Rama’s suffering and Sita’s plight at Ravana’s hands. When Hanuman concluded his narration, Bharata embraced him and promised to bestow upon him all kinds of wealth for bringing him the only news that he ever wanted to hear – of beloved Rama’s return to Ayodhya.</p>
			<p>The city of Ayodhya drowned in the nectar of joy at Rama’s homecoming. A spirit of cheer and carnival atmosphere prevailed. Joyous shouts of “Here comes Rama. Here comes the glorious son of Dasharatha! Hail Rama our king,” reached deafening proportions as the Pushpaka Vimana touched down at Ayodhya. Streets of the city were choked with people who came out to see their dearest prince. Bharata prostrated before his brother who gently picked him up and held him in a close hug. Tears flowed in a deluge when the brothers united. Bharata embraced Sugreeva and proclaimed him to be their fifth brother. “It is our good fortune that through the gesture of goodwill, you extended your hand in friendship to Rama. And is not a good friend, as good as a brother!”</p>
			<p>Rama who had been most anxious to see Bharata, was relieved and happy to meet him. He then rushed to meet his mother Kausalya. She had become pale and weak from sorrow, having lost her husband and being separated from her son and daughter-in-law. Rama touched her feet and sought her blessing. He then paid his respects to Sumitra, and Kaikeyi, the queen mother who had brought him fame and had enabled the gods to be delivered from the misery wrought on them by Ravana and his demon race.</p>
			<p>Ayodhya returned to a state of calm after the initial euphoria subsided. Bharata who had eagerly awaited Rama’s return, addressed Rama most reverentially, and in all humility: “Beloved brother, it is now time for you to take charge of our kingdom which rightfully belongs to you.”</p>
			<p>The queen mothers, sages and scholars, and the council of ministers agreed with Bharata. Rama was crowned king in a grand celebration befitting royals, and Bharata was installed prince regent.</p>
			<p>In the history of ancient India, Rama Rajya was a golden period where its people enjoyed peace and prosperity because it was ruled by an emperor known for his sense of justice and compassion. Nothing was more important to him than the welfare of his people who held him close to their heart. Dharma reigned supreme in the vast land, without a trace of greed, lust and avarice. The kingdom of Kosala witnessed no theft, no murders and no harassment of its womenfolk. It was a land where no father performed the funeral rites of a son, and no young woman was made a widow. Ayodhya and Kosala enjoyed Divine Bliss under Rama, who was ably assisted by his brothers, for thousands of years.</p>
