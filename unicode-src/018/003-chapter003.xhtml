		<p>Mudra means symbol. Mudra means insignia. Mudra means commitment. Samudra means full commitment. That is why God is called as Samudra - as He has full commitment in everything and never does anything half-heartedly.</p>
<p>According to Gheranda Samhita, Mudras and Bandhas are done to steady the body. Mudras and Bandhas help in preventing the dissipation of energy, and help in redirecting the energy. Bandhas are the lock and mudras are the lock over a lock.</p>
<p>Hata Yoga Pradipika talks about Maha Mudra, Maha Bandha, Maha Vedha, Jalandhar Bandha, Uddyan Bandha, Moola Bandha, Viparta Karini Mudra, Khechari Mudra, Aswini Mudra, Vrajoli Mudra, Shambhavi Mudra and Shan Mukhi Mudra.</p>
<p><em>Ha</em> means sun,<em> Ta </em>means moon. The seat of moon centre is the <em>Sahasrara chakra,</em> and the seat of sun system is the <em>Manipura </em><em>Chakra</em> at the navel. Our active life continues as long as the nectar remains in the <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> at the crown. Just like pressing the accelerator in the car draws more fuel, when we breathe rapidly, we draw more nectar from the <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> which flows into the <em>Manipura Chakra</em> where it gets consumed. Bandhas like Jalandhara bandha, Kriyas like Vasudeva Kriya, Viparita Karani, asanas such as Shirasasana, Sarvangasana, Vrischikasana etc. reduce the consumption of the nectar (<em>Amruta</em>) at <em>Manipura Chakra</em> and preserve the body’s vitality.</p>
<p>By manipulating our prana or vital energy, we can direct it towards better health, well being and personal transformation.</p>
<p>Mudra is defined as <em>Mudham Dadaati Devaanam Dravayasya </em><em>Asuraarapi</em> – ‘That by which the divine beings get happiness and the negative forces and diseases are driven away’. Mudras are used in <em>Tantra puja</em>.</p>
<p>Mudras are classified in to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kaya Mudra</strong>mudra through body- Viparitakarani, Yoga mudra, Manduki Mudra etc)</li>
<li><strong>Mana Mudra </strong>(mudra through the senses on the face- using lips, eyes, nose, ear, tongue – Shambhavi, Kaki, Akashi, Nasika Dristi, Shanmukhi, Khechari)</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hasta Mudra (hand mudra)</h2>
<p><strong>Dhanvantari Mantra (Healing mantra):</strong></p> 
<p class="verse">Om Ayam me hasto Bhagavan ayam me bhagavattaraha <br /> Ayam me viswa bheshajaha ayam Shivabhi marshanaha</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="dev">ॐ अयं मे हस्तो भगवानयं मे भगवत्तरः । अयं मे विश्ववेदसोऽयं शिवाऽऽभिमर्शनः ।</span></p>
<p><strong>The broad meaning of this mantra:</strong> “The Supreme Lord resides in my palms as the greatest healer. All the medicinal herbs of this world are in my palms. By His Grace, through these palms I heal myself and I will be an instrument in healing others.”</p>
<p>The body is made up of 5 elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. When these five elements are not in balance we get various physical and psychological ailments. The energy from the body radiates out mainly through the tip of the nose, lips, fingertips and toes. When the thumb is brought in contact with the other fingers, energy is directed back to vitalize various parts of our body. This is called a circuit bypass. Mudras and bandhas go hand in hand. Bandhas help in locking in the energy, whereas mudras help in redirecting the energy.</p>
<p>Mudras are the expression of our inner feeling. In the Tantra shastra, Mudra is defined as ‘the one which gives happiness.’ Mudras form a part of yoga and are together referred to as Yoga Mudra. Mudras done using hands are called Hasta Mudra. Indian classical dances such as Bharata Natyam, Yakshagana, Mohini Aattam, Kathakali, Kuchupudi, Oddissi make use of mudras to express their art forms. In the temples deities show different mudras. Of those the most well-known mudra is the abhaya mudra (reassuring mudra). In Tirupathi, Balaji’s statue depicts that ‘if you surrender to my feet, your problems are knee deep - and you can easily walk through them.’</p>
<p>The five fingers represent the five elements (tatvas):</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb: Fire <em>(agni)</em></li>
<li>Index Finger: Air <em>(vayu)</em></li>
<li>Middle finger: Space <em>(akasha)</em></li>
<li>Ring Finger: Earth <em>(pritvi)</em></li>
<li>Small finger: Water <em>(jala)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fire is the most important of the five elements. When the fire element becomes weak in the body, various ailments come to the body. Through the practice of Mudras the fire element (thumb) is joined with the other elements (other fingers) to vitalize those elements also.</p>
