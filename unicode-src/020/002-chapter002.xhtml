		<p>Manali Kallat Vainu Bappu was born on August 10, 1927 in Chennai and brought up in Hyderabad. His ancestors hailed from Kannur in Kerala, but several members of the family had also migrated to Mangalore and nearby places. Sunanna, his mother hailed from Thalassery. She lost her father at an early age, and was brought up by her maternal aunt. His father was Manali Kukuzhi Bappu. Vainu Bappu was born two years after their marriage. He was their only child.</p>
		<p>Father worked as an astronomer at the Nizam iah Observatory, Hyderabad. A rich nobleman of Hyderabad, Nawab Zafar Jung, started a private observatory in Hyderabad in 1901. It had a telescope with a 15-inch diameter lens, the largest in India at that tim e. It was form ally established as the Nizamiah Observatory in 1908 by a firman of the Nawab of Hyderabad. In the years 1914 to 1937, the observatory participated in an international program called “Carte-du-Ciel” or astrographic sky survey, in which it mapped and catalogued as many as 800,000 stars in both the southern as well as the northern parts of sky.</p>
		<p>Kukuzhi Bappu was a very active astronomer. He used to contribute a large num ber of observations to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association. He also participated in the “Carte-duCiel” program and his signature can be found even today on the photographic plates, which have been carefully preserved at the Department of Astronomy, Osmania University.</p>

		<p>Vainu’s early years were spent in Hyderabad. He first joined St. Anne’s Convent and later I slam ia High School. His maternal uncles were well educated. One was an engineer and the other had a M.A. degree in English. He worked as a head master in a high school, teaching English. They had a great influence on Vainu. They used to present him books on birthdays and this induced a healthy reading habit in him. He had a similar influence from the father’s side. His paternal grand-father was a noted author in Malayalam. His father also had a good collection of books. More than this, his mother had a big influence in his early days. Though not skilled in the traditional ‘3Rs’, she knew the value of education and her main aim was that he should do well in his studies. She would wake him up at five in the morning, and she herself never went back to sleep to keep a watchful eye and provide him with coffee and whatever he wanted. Even during vacations, she kept vigil, though relaxed a bit. Later Bappu used to tell his wife,” just when my holidays started, I used to look forward to sleeping for a longer time. But my mother would wake me up at six in the morning and say “this is the time you should be reading general books and enlarge your knowledge base.” This had a great influence on Bappu later in life. He could speak with authority on many subjects- music, cinema, flowers, trees, etc leave alone astronomy.</p>
		<p>After high school, Bappu joined the Nizam’s College in Hyderabad in 1942. His childhood friend L.K. Doraiswamy (who later retired as the Director of National Chemical Laboratory, Pune) has very interestingly narrated the education system, admission to colleges and so on of that time. It also echoes the kind of friendship that young Vainu Bappu was capable of forging with the people around him , which he maintained to the end of his life (see appendix 4). He was then below the age limit for admission to the University and a special exemption had to be sought. Being the youngest in the class. his friends used to call him the “baby” of the class, but during the examination time they would flock around him to get help in many subjects, because he could solve many problems they could not. He was also the secretary of the college physics association.</p>
		<p>Vainu had a great love for poetry. Wordsworth, Shelly, Keats, Kipling were all his favorites. Urdu poetry, particularly Ghazals, fascinated him. Mirza Ghalib was his favorite Urdu poet.</p>
		<p>He was not, however, a bookworm . He had a fascination for adventure. As a young boy, Vainu had a secret ambition to become an aircraft pilot, chiefly because of the spirit of adventure. One of his favorite books was the “Spirit of St. Louis”, which immortalizes the saga of Charles A. Lindbergh, who flew a single engine airplane on a non-stop flight from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927. He loved other sports too- particularly cricket. Even when he grew up, this craze for cricket continued. Though he never took leave from work for any reason, cricket was an exception. During the Pongal holiday, he used to visit his father-in-law in Chennai. At that time if there was a cricket Test Match, the holiday would extend to all six days of the match! He will go to watch the match with his father-in-law who was also a cricket fan. Later in life, he developed interest in tennis and golf. He had a great interest in painting and was an ardent lover of nature. He gave expression to these qualities when he took personal interest in developing the landscapes for the institutions and observatories he built at Bangalore, Kodaikanal, and Kavalur. He even designed domes for the observatories. Today, they stand as testimony for his artistic vision. In this aspect, he adm ired another great I ndian scientist Hom i Jehangir Bhabha, the father of I ndian nuclear science and technology.</p>
		<p>The seeds of his interest in science in general and astronomy in particular were sowed much early in life. Young Vainu used to accompany his father to the observatory and quickly learnt the operation of telescopes and other instruments. Not only that, he used to regularly read the papers published in the Astrophysical Journal. Later he would say, “I learnt my astronomy on the lap of my father”. Bappu also got a lesson of life from his father who used to advise his son, “Whatever you do, do with deliberation”. Vainu Bappu followed this advice throughout his life.</p>

		<p>This early exposure to astronomy proved to be a great asset for his career later in life. As an example of his early interest in science, Prof. Ramaseshan cites an incident. In the 1943 Annual Meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences held in Hyderabad, Sir C.V.Raman was to deliver a series of lectures. Vainu did not want to miss them. So every day he used to cycle more than 16 kilometers each way, after college, to attend the lectures.</p>
		<p>In spite of all these young Bappu was shy by nature, spoke only when spoken to, and incredibly self-conscious. L.K. Doraiswamy recalls, “an incident that has remained unfaded in my memory was the occasion when C.V. Raman gave a talk at the college. By unanimous consent, Vainu was chosen to introduce him. We discussed his introduction in great depth for days before the event. Phrases like “There is no need to introduce the sun to the tropics” and many similar ones were considered and rejected, till the final few lines were carefully crafted. The moment arrived. Vainu stood up and walked to the podium, with a sheet of paper in his hands. He stood, and stood – petrified! No words came. Finally he blurted out: “I present to you Sir C. V. Raman” (or something close – I do not fully recall), and made a hasty retreat to his seat”. On another occasion, while walking across the cricket field in the Nizam College, he had one side of his face covered with books, and with Doraiswamy on the other side, whispered to him “is anybody watching?” But, in due course some shyness and nervousness to give speeches had gone. Later in his career he spoke with utter clarity, making complex issues look simple- the hallmark of a great scientist and speaker.</p>
		<p>It is astonishing to note that Vainu published his first scientific paper in 1946, at the age of just 19 when he was still an undergraduate student of the Nizam College (affiliated to the University of Madras) in Hyderabad. It was a study of variable starsin the constellation Eridanus.</p>
		<div class="inlay">
			<p>Variable stars are fascinating objects to the astronomers. They vary in their brightness on timescales of a few seconds to several days or even years. Some are periodic variables and some are irregular in their light variation.</p>
		</div>
		<p>By then, Vainu had collected material for another paper on the spectrum of night airglow using a spectrograph, which he alone had designed and built. To record the spectrum he had to expose a photographic plate to the night sky for six consecutive nights through his bedroom window.</p>
		<p>Bappu completed Bachelor’s degree in 1946 from the Nizam’s College. During this period, he published two more papers in the journal Current Science. In 1949, he completed M.Sc degree in physics from the same institution.</p>
		<p>His choice of subject for further studies was obvious. It was astronomy. But, there was no institution in India offering courses in astronomy. He was offered a research fellowship to work on a project on telecommunication at Battersea Polytechnic in London. In the absence anything else, he was thinking of accepting it, when fortuitous circumstances presented a unique opportunity towards realization of his goal.</p>
		<p>That unique opportunity was the visit of two renowned astronomers to India; Sir Harold Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal, UK and Professor Harlow Shapley of the Harvard University, USA. Vainu had read in the newspapers that they would be com ing to Hyderabad. He attended all their lectures, made notes and decided to meet Prof. Shapley to find out if there was any opportunity for him in the USA. He went to meet Shapley at his hotel. But Shapley’s secretary would not let Bappu m eet the professor without appointment and Shapley had already fixed up another appointment. Bappu insisted that he is a student and should meet the professor. While Shapley agreed to meet him for a short while, the meeting went on for one and half hours! Bappu must have impressed the professor, who promised to do his best to get him to Harvard College Observatory where he worked. Thanks to Shapley’s efforts, Vainu found himself in Harvard University in early 1949 on a Government of Hyderabad scholarship to do his research in astronomy. From then on Bappu never turned back. Later he would say, “I will never forget in m y life that m eeting with Harlow Shapley”. That meeting gave a prolific astronomer, not only to India but also to the world.</p>
