		<p>Just before independence, the Government of India realized the importance of practical astronomy and decided to take steps to revive the country’s glorious past. A committee was set up in 1945 under the leadership of the renowned Indian astrophysicist Prof. Meghnad Saha to make recommendations in this regard. The committee had several sittings in Kodaikanal and Bangalore. In its recommendations, the Committee suggested a long-range plan and some imm ediate initiatives. The im mediate initiatives were regarding modernization and expansion of Kodaikanal Observatory, which was under the Meteorological Department of the Government of India, and establishment of small observatories at the Universities of Delhi, Agra and Benares to be used for teaching and training graduate students. The long-range plan was to establish “an astronom ical observatory provided with a large sized telescope for special stellar work” so that Indian astronomers could independently do som e front line research. The proposals had the backing of many scientists of the day including Sir C.V. Raman.</p>
		<p>Prof. A.K. Das was the Director of the Kodaikanal Observatory. He proposed the procurem ent of a large telescope in the first five-year plan and selected a site near Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, keeping in view its importance as a center of ancient Indian astronomy. However, due to financial reasons the project was dropped.</p>
		<p>At that stage, he decided to give priority to those recommendations that could be immediately carried out. The solar observing facilities at Kodaikanal were upgraded with a new solar tower telescope and a coronagraph with a monochromatic filter for continuous monitoring of solar chrom osphere. With these facilities the Kodaikanal Observatory was able to actively participate in the International Geophysical Year, 1957-58.</p>
		<p>Prof. Das retired in 1960. The government started looking for an able and inspiring leader to take his place. Vainu Bappu was the natural choice. The Kodaikanal offer had a dramatic touch. Reminiscing that event Yemuna says, “Dr. Vikram Sarabhai had come to Nainital with his family. Bappu knew them well. One day when they were visiting us, Bappu received a phone call from Mr. Krishna Rao, Director-General of Observatories. He said that Prof. Das had retired and he wants Bappu to take over as the Director of Kodaikanal Observatory. Bappu had just then nurtured the Nainital Observatory and placed it on a course of growth with a select band of young astronomers. He did not know how to respond to the offer and asked for some time. He discussed the matter with Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, who encouraged him to accept the offer.</p>
		<p>In April 1960, Bappu handed over the responsibility of the Nainital Observatory to the young group of astronomers he had trained and took over as the Director of Kodaikanal Observatory. He was the youngest director to be appointed at 33, in its 60 years history. That was the beginning of a glorious chapter not only in Bappu’s life but also in the history of Indian astronomy. Twenty-five years later Prof. Bhattacharyya, a long time colleague writes, “It is impossible to describe the present growth of Indian astronomy without mentioning his monumental contributions. His uncommon devotion, far-sightedness and scientific achievements adorn the present chapter of the history of Indian astronomy”.</p>

		<p>Just before Bappu took over, a new telescope- Grubb-Parsons solar telescope- had been installed at Kodaikanal. However, the operation of the telescope was hindered by the faulty design of the dome. Therefore, Bappu had to dism antle the whole structure and design a new one, which not only removed the defects, but also stands out today as an example of a graceful dome architecture. During this period, a large number of Ph.D students as well as some professional astronomers joined Kodaikanal. In addition to allocating projects for them, Bappu took personal interest in training them in the various techniques of observations. K.R.Sivaraman, who obtained a transfer from the Poona office of the India Meteorological Department to Kadaikanal and was assigned the study of comet Ikeya-Seki which was making its appearance then, recalls his experience of learning at Bappu’s hands. He writes, “I was passing through an experience that I consider most valuable in my life- to learn the methods of analysis with he and me sitting together for hours – day and night, taking me through the various steps. My joy was boundless. He had a special way of transmitting the excitement and enthusiasm.”</p>
		<p>As mentioned earlier, Kodaikanal Observatory was established in 1899. The observational data at Kodaikanal had two hundred years of history, carried over from the Madras Observatory. Bappu reviewed som e of the observations recorded by his predecessors and produced a number of important research papers. At the same time, he wanted to initiate some new programs. The first job that Bappu undertook was to establish an optics workshop under the supervision of Sri A.P.Jayarajan, a highly skilled optical instruments man. Jayarajan was quick to organize an optical shop on a modest scale where he could grind, polish and test m irrors and lenses needed for the spectrometers and other instruments.</p>
		<p>This workshop was an addition to the already existing mechanical workshop, and was meant to augment the technical capabilities of the observatory, where new instruments could be designed and built and older ones serviced. In course of time, the workshop grew in size and in capability to take up the massive work of grinding and polishing the mirror for the largest telescope in the country. We will see more about this later.</p>
		<p>Bappu also introduced modern electronic control systems to the existing telescopes and initiated investigational studies in solar physics. Telescopes must not only be able to help humans to see the happenings in the sky, but also record them for future studies. Hence, sophisticated spectrometers were developed as part of observational system.</p>
		<h2>A Stellar Observatory</h2>
		<p>Kodaikanal had done frontline research work in solar physics and solar astronomy. Bappu desired to create an equally good observatory for stellar observation. The requirements of a stellar observatory are different from those of a solar observatory. The Sun is about 150 million kms away from Earth. In astronomical sense, it is so close that light emitted by the Sun takes only eight minutes to reach the Earth. The next nearest star, alpha Centauri, is nearly 300,000 times farther away. Its light takes four years to reach the Earth! Hence, though many stars are far brighter than the Sun, they appear as mere specks of light for an observer on Earth because of their distance. That being the case, stellar signals are much fainter than solar signals, and need instruments that are more sensitive and the recording of the images needs much longer exposures. However, Kodaikanal was not the most suitable place for a stellar observatory. It is in the path of two monsoons which reduce the number of days of cloudless clear sky. Therefore, he was again on the hunt for a new site for a stellar observatory.</p>
		<p>One of the choices was Ujjain, because of its historical association with ancient Indian astronomy. Ujjain, because of its higher latitude, was more suited to observe the northern sky. However, the bigger telescopes in USA and Europe were already set to observe the northern sky and there was no point in competing with them. His idea was to observe the southern sky, which is much more accessible from the Southern part of the country - the Indian peninsula. Hence, Bappu wanted to have the new observatory in the south.</p>
		<p>In addition to the location of the site with respect to geography, there are three parameters for deciding the suitability of a location for a stellar observatory. The first is how many clear and cloudless nights in a year one can have? This is not something that one can say off-hand like the Malnad sky is more often cloud covered than the one over a dry place. One has to examine years of scientific data collected by the meteorological department to arrive at a scientific conclusion.</p>
		<p>The second one is what astronomers call the ‘seeing’. The sky may be clear, but when stars are observed through a telescope, they appear to be dancing. This reduces the resolution or sharpness of the im age. I t is the sam e phenomenon that causes the familiar twinkling of the stars. It occurs because of temperature fluctuations in the air caused by factories, vehicles and other types of heat generating sources. For this reason, even clearer nights, if the atm osphere is dry, m ay becom e unsuitable for observation. Hence, one looks for a green cover, away from modern civilization and with cooler air temperature. The third point, as discussed earlier, is the light pollution of the night sky caused by streetlights, vehicular lights, etc. This not only reduces the sharpness of the spectrum, but may also introduce new lines, confusing the observer.</p>
		<p>Bappu and his team, with a telescope in hand surveyed the entire southern India. Away from civilization, moving from hill tops to deep jungles, they scanned the sky from Thirupathi to Kanyakumari. Reflecting on those days Bappu writes, “Poor observing conditions at Kodaikanal, especially during night hours, prompted the search for a site for a field station for stellar telescopes. A site survey team set out on April 10, 1962 to examine the observing conditions in the Yellagiri and Javadi Hills. The team set up camps deep in the interior of the forests on Yellagiri, principally inhabited by tribals. A portable telescope was used to study the image definition and quality. At last the sandal wood forested Javadi Hills in Tamil Nadu was found to be most suitable. It is surrounded by hills creating a natural trap for still air. The dense forest reduced ground heating, produced a stable local atmosphere minimizing the perturbations caused to the incoming stellar light.</p>

		<p>Thus, a new star on the map of Indian astronomy was born. The Kavalur Observatory, named after the nearby village, came up on a 100-acre forestland. By 1967, a 38 cm telescope, though small by modern standards, was installed and stellar observations started right earnestly. Then, he persuaded the authorities to place orders with the famous Carl Zeiss Company of Germany for a much larger, onemeter (mirror diameter) telescope. And that was another exciting story.</p>

		<p>In an hour-long chat, Mr. Jayarajan, now 87 years old, emotionally reminisced those days. “The one-meter Carl Zeiss telescope to be installed in Kavalur was a highly sophisticated instrument at that time. Bappu himself was full of energy and enthusiasm, which was highly infectious,” he recalled. “He was very farsighted. His idea was that after Germans had come and installed the telescope, we should not go back to them for maintenance, servicing and repairs. We should be able to do all that ourselves. Hence, even before they arrived, not only did he learn the German language, but made me also do so. During the installation, he was present all the time, watching every step. As the director, he could have simply deputed someone else and taken it easy. That was the kind of involvement he had”.</p>
		<p>Installation of a telescope is only one part of the complex program. Unlike at the time of Galileo when human eyes were the only recording apparatus for the events seen through the telescope, twentieth century astronomers had lined up a whole lot of sophisticated instruments as accessories. These included sensitive photographic plates, high gain photomultipliers and image intensifiers to study faint objects, spectrum scanners controlled by on-line computers, data handling devices, and so on. Even before the telescope was installed, Bappu initiated capacity building in telescope technology by setting up an electronics instrumentation group led by J.C.Bhattacharya and an optical shop where A.P.Jayarajan began acquiring skills in mirror grinding, figuring, polishing and testing. Simultaneously a number of smaller telescopes (a 75 cm reflector, 60 cm Schmidt telescope) fabricated in the Kodaikanal optical shop were also installed and brought into operation at Kavalur.</p>

		<p>Because of this advance planning, when the Carl Zeiss telescope was installed in 1972, it was immediately available for observations. Within a month after the installation, it was associated with an interesting discovery in the solar system. The occasion was an occultation. Occultation is an event in which light from a star is blocked by another object, say the moon or a planet. By observing the light from the star during an occultation, astronomers can derive a wealth of information about the temperature, pressure, density profiles and composition of planetary atmosphere. On 7 June 1972 the third Jovian satellite, <strong>Ganymede occulted the star SAO 186800</strong>. Writing about this occultation, Prof. D.C.V. Mallik, a senior astronomer notes that the astronomers at Kavalur had just then carried out an important observation which, for the first time, gave an indication of the existence of an atmosphere in the Jovian satellite Ganymede. It was a fulfilling experience as it was perhaps the first significant use that they made of the newly acquired 102 cm Zeiss telescope.’’</p>
		<p>Five years later, using the sam e telescope Indian astronomers made the surprise discovery of rings around the planet Uranus. This time it was the occultation of the <strong>star SAO158687 by the planet Uranus</strong>. The astronomers planned to use the occasion to study the atmosphere of Uranus. But surprisingly, as the star moved behind the planet they observed dips in the brightness of the star, both while entering and leaving the shadow of the planet. Though it was first interpreted as due to the presence of an unknown planet, it was soon realized that Uranus may be surrounded by a ring system. It was earlier presumed that only Saturn had such icy rings. From preliminary observations five rings were deduced. In fact, similar observations were made by US astronomers from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and by another team of astronomers at Perth in Australia. Since these teams could confirm and publish their results earlier, the credit of the discovery goes to them. Vainu Bappu was so excited by this discovery that the artist in him expressed through a painting of what he imagined to be the rings of Uranus. Recent observations and imaging by space craft Voyager 2 and Hubble Space Telescope now put the rings to be 15 with varying brightness and width (some only a few kilometers across) and several moons.</p>

		<p>Another important event in the astronomical history of India was the birth of the Astronomical Society of India. In a gathering of astronomers from across the country at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore it was unanimously decided to create the Astronomical Society of India (ASI). Bappu was the first president of ASI.</p>
