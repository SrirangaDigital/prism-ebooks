		<p><em>SMT. THANKAMANI KUTTY, wonderful both as an artiste and a teacher of Bharatanatyam and Mohiniattam, has planned this book for the young ones who want to take their first steps in the exquisite dance form, Bharatanatyam which has no parallel in this country. I know of no other person who is better equipped than her for this job. She knows the form inside out, and she is as expressive on stage, in bringing out the unchanted sources of grace and majesty of it, as she is before her students who are electrified by her distinctive style of teaching. </em></p>
		<p><em>Indian dance, in all its classical and regional varieties, is now a part of world culture, and is being accepted far beyond the national boundaries of the country, not only by immigrant Indians, but also by people of land who have little knowledge of, or exposure to, Indian culture. This shows that dance, along with music, is the most universal art form and can break the cultural barriers more easily than the rest. I therefore think it an excellent idea to write a simple manual in English, in which short, easy steps are shown towards achieving a credible command on these dance forms. Dance of course is more of a </em>‘‘<em>Gurumukhi Vidya</em>’’<em>(Guru-dependant discipline) than any other such arts, but oral tradition has long since been replaced by literate and lately, printed tradition and one must take all the advantages available in the form of media for communicating to a wider audience. A book on dance, particularly an intricate dance form like Bharatanatyam, does not lead to the mastery of the form automatically, nor does anyone harbour any illusion about that. But a book such as this is still a big help and saver of time and effort, as it provides access to information that can be used and absorbed even when one is not practising. </em></p>
		<p><em>Smt. Kutty has done a fine job in writing this book. Her presentation is lucid and business like and I am sure young aspirants in Bharatanatyam will benefit immensely by making this book their constant companion. </em></p>

		<h1 class="level1-title text-center" epub:type="title">FOREWORD</h1>
		<p><em>At no stage in the history of mankind have people universally taken so much of interest in the classical dances. </em></p>
		<p><em>Long strides have been taken in every field of human endeavour, so it is but natural that these disciplines should also reflect the age. A standardised and systematic approach towards understanding these disciplines, is essential for further improvement. </em></p>
		<p><em>In my long experience as a teacher of the dance form of Bharatanatyam. I have not known of any attempt having made so far, to standardise a syllabus for beginners, ensuring discipline, which is an indispensable part of learing, the basics of the said art form. </em></p>
		<p><em>I have also realized that it is not enough for the teacher alone to know what is to be taught to the pupils at different levels. The teaching and learning process combine to create a common sharing ground of knowledge for teachers and pupils alike, when the pupils are made aware of the programme that the teacher intends to follow, in advance. This goes a long way towards creating a good teacher-student relationship. </em></p>
		<p><em>I have written this book, based on the carefully formulated course of teaching that I have followed and have mainly adhered to ‘Bharata’s Natya Sastra’, Nandikeswara’s ‘Abhinaya Darpana’ and other books that I have used as reference. </em></p>
		<p><em>My aim has been , to guide a sincere enthusiast of Bharatanatyam through the very basics of the form and thus to prepare him/her for the advanced stage of learning. </em></p>
		<p><em>I also hope that my endeavour to systematize the general education of our classical arts would be beneficial to all the aspirants of Bharatanatyam and to the lovers of this art form. I aspire to bring about the basic schooling of Bharatanatyam, so that the outcome of the much devoted and painstaking practice does not go wasted. </em></p>
		<p><em>I greatly acknowledge the encouragement received from Respected Sri Pabitra Sarkar, the Vice-Chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta. </em></p>
		<p class="text-right"><strong><em>Thankamani Kutty</em></strong></p>

		<p class="text-center"><strong>BHARATANÂTYAM</strong></p>
		<p>A dance style truly Indian &#38;#38; devotional in character which evolved from its ritualistic roots through the ages to its present highly developed fine art form. It owes its existence to royal patronage and the devadasis who practised and preserved it, aiming spiritual identification. Closely adhering to ‘Bharata’s Nâtya Sâstra’, a comprehensive compilation of the then prevailing dance, drama &#38;#38; music between 4th Century and 1st Century B.C. and Nandikeswara’s ‘Abhinaya Darpanâ’, the name ‘Bharatanâtyam’ itself is about 200 years old and may have been compounded from the three syllables BHÂ (Bhâva or Emotion), RÂ (Râga or Melody), and TÂ (Tâla or Rhythm) and ‘NÂTYAM’ Or Drama.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>IMPORTANCE OF HAND GESTURES</strong></p>
		<p>The art of hand gestures is so vast that it covers all the aspects of human life and the universe. They are capable of expressing a number of things, including abstract concepts like beauty and truth. The hands become the vehicle of ‘dance-speech’ and can translate song words into sign words. The language of hand guestures enables the dancer to express practically anything. It augments the communication, enhances the impact of Abhinaya and endows it with poetry. The hands have life-Hastaprâna and invest the classical dance form with an enchanting quality.</p>
		<p>Nritta Hastâs are decorative hand gestures. It is used to enhance the beauty of the dance.</p>
