<p>One of the striking features of the Indian Classical dances is the use of the hand gestures of ‘Hasta Mudrâs’. The hand gestures are taken from the two most authentic dance text books -Nâtya Shâstra &#38; Abhinaya Darpanâ. Hastâs are classified into three categories - NRITTA (pure dance), ASAMYUTA (Single) and SAMYUTA (double) hastâs.</p>
<p><strong>NRITTA HASTÂS:</strong> When a single hand or both hands are used purely for decorative effect and without intending to convey any meaning, they are called Nritta Hastâs.</p> 
<p><strong>ASAMYUTA HASTÂS:</strong> When a single hand is used as a codified gesture, it is known as an Asamyuta Hasta.</p> 
<p><strong>SAMYUTA HASTÂS:</strong> When both hands are used in combination, they make a Samyuta hasta.</p>
<p><strong>NRITTA HASTÂS:</strong> In pure dance movements thirteen hand gestures are mostly used.</p>
<p>(See the enclosed pictures)<br />They are as follows :<br />PATÂKÂ, TRIPATÂKÂ, KARTARI MUKHA, KATAKÂ MUKHA, ALAPADMA, MUSHTI, SHIKHARA, SUCHI, TÂMRACHUDA, KAPITTHA, MRIGA SHIRSHA, SWASTIKA AND AVAHITHA.</p>

<p>Bharata Nâtyam is basically a devotional dance, so before and after every dance session be it a recital or a class, the dancer commences with Salutation, which is known as Tatti Kumbidal in Tamil language.</p>
<p>The simple movement of Salutation signifies high sentiments. The dancer prays for forgiveness for stamping Mother Earth. The salutation starts in SAMAPÂDA position stamping each foot alternatively with KATAKÂ MUKHA MUDRÂ in front of chest. Then comes SIKHARA MUDRÂ which indicates the eight corners of the Universe, followed by PATAKA MUDRÂ to pay respect to Mother Earth, then comes ANJALI MUDRÂ. The ANJALI MUDRÂ above the head is a spiritual salutation to the Almighty God, at the forehead, denotes on intellectual reverence to the teacher and at the chest level, signifies a sincere greeting to the friends and audience from the region of the heart.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">(2) NÂTTADAVU</h2>
<p>NÂTTA’ (ÂLIDHA) means to stretch. From the ARAMANDI (ÂYATAPÂRSHVA feet position), one leg is stretched outwards in any direction striking the floor with the heel (ANCHITA feet position) and is then brought back to the original position or behind of the other PÂRSHVA feet position. There are thirteen important variations of this ADAVU.</p>
<p>The syllables are as follows :</p>
<p>TAI  YUM  TAT  THÂ  TAI  YUM  TÂ   HÂ</p>
<p>a) The hand movements for NÂTTADAVU start with ADHASTHALA TRIPATÂKA mudra in both arms stretched sideways horizontally. Taiyum when the foot is in Alidha (or Natta) position, the respective hand is upturned as UTTHÂNA and for TATTA it becomes ADHASTHALA again.</p>
<p>b) The same movements as described above are repeated twice on each side.</p>
<p>c) The hands and feet for Tai Yum Tat Tha are same as (a). For ‘Tai’ the right TRIPATÂKA is drawn near the right side of the chest as UTTHÂNA simultaneously the right toes hit the floor behind the left foot. On ‘Yum’ the left foot is stamped, at the same time the right hand becomes ADHASTHALA.On ‘TA’ the right hand is again pushed out to its former position as UTTHÂNA and the right foot is in ALIDHA and ANCHITA foot position. On ‘HA’ the hand becomes ADHOMUKHA and the foot comes back to the starting position. Same movements are repeated on the other side.</p>
<p>d) The movements of (c) are repeated twice on each side.</p>
<p>e &#38; f) The NÂTTA position could be both the front or side; the hand has to be in line with it. For ‘TAI YUM’, the ALAPADMA hand is stretched out and for ‘TAT THA’, the hand is near the chest as KATAKÂMUKHA. For ‘TAI YUM TÂ HÂ’, the same movements are repeated on the other side.</p>
<p>g) The NÂTTA of the leg is in front with two ALAPADMA stretched near the toes for ‘TAI YUM’. For ‘TAT THA’, the hands are near the chest as KATAKÂMUKHA. For ‘TAI YUM TÂ HÂ’ the same movements are repeated on the other side.</p>
<p>h &#38; i) in the next two, three types of feet positions are used :</p>
<p>ÂYATA, ÂLIDHA &#38; PRERITA. The hand gestures are KATAKÂMUKHA &#38; ALAPADMA.</p>
<p>j) With the feet in ÂYATA position jump with both feet on the syllable TAI, on YUM, the right heel is stamped on the floor away from the left foot, on TAT, the left toes stamp the floor behind the right foot, on THÂ, the right foot comes back to the starting position stamping the floor. For TAI YUM TÂ HÂ same movements are repeated on the other side. The hand gestures are KATAKÂMUKHA &#38; ALAPADMA.</p>
<p>k) This variety is jumping with both feet on TAI, stamping the right heel on YUM, the left foot is brought behind the right foot on TAT and these last two sequences are repeated three times finishing at the starting position. The hand gestures are the same as (j).</p>
<p>During the faster speed, the 2nd step in case of (j) and the 2nd, 4th &#38; the 6th step in case of (k) is done with stamping the foot (for the right and left side) instead of the heel.</p>
<p>l) The right TRIPATÂKA hand from NÂTYÂRAMBHA posture is lowered near the right toes for TaI. The body is also bent down alongwith the lowered hand. For YUM, the PARSHVA-ÂYATA, left foot is stamped. For TAT, the lowered hand is raised above the head, simultaneously the right toes hit the floor behind the left foot. Fot THÂ, the left foot is again stamped. This sequence is repeated three times after which the adavu finishes with TAI TAI DHI THI TAI which has to be explained in class.</p>
<p>m) On TAI, the right foot is extended (ANCHITA) to the side. On YUM, the left foot is stamped, on TAT, the right toes hit the floor behind the left foot, on THÂ, the left foot is stamped on the floor, on TAI, jump with the feet together, on YUM, the left foot is stamped on the floor, simultaneously the right foot is brought upto the knee of the left foot, on TÂ, full sitting position on toes, on H, getting up with the feet together (SAMAPÂDA).
