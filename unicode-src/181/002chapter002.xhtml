		<p>It is well established that coffee drinking originated in Arabia. The popular legend of how a goatherd named Kaldi in Abyssinia found his goats happily dancing and prancing one evening after eating the coffee berries is the oldest reference to this beverage. The goatherd brought this phenomenon to the notice of a mufti who experimented with the berries and made a brew using the beans. The mufti who had a problem of falling asleep during his prayers now found himself exhilarated and able to keep awake longer. His seminary came to be known as the ‘wakeful monastery’. This news soon spread, and the concoction gained popularity in the Muslim seminaries in the neighbourhood.</p>
		<p>The earliest written reference to coffee is by Rhazes (850-922A.D.) who was a highly respected philosopher, astronomer and physician in Baghdad. The concoction made from coffee bean was known as bunchum at the time, and it was ‘primarily’ recommended for its medicinal properties. In Yemen, this drink gained rapid popularity, and was referred to as Kohwah – precursor to its present name: Coffee.</p>
		<p>Coffee drinking became ritualistic, and the potion was consumed by the devoted dervishes. Most of those in Muslim seminaries in Arabia used to conduct their religious discourses in the evenings to avoid the blistering heat during daytime. Drinking Kohwah kept them alert and awake late into the night. By the end of the fifteenth century, coffee drinking spread to Mecca, Medina and Cairo. It was only a matter of time before the general public too took a liking to this beverage. Soon the quality of the decoction was improved by roasting the beans.</p>

		<p>It was in Mecca that the first coffee houses known as ‘Kaveh Kane’ were established. These became recreational centres where people played chess, listened to music and danced. This resulted in poor attendance at the mosques and a section of the rigid clergy started arguing against the beverage. They equated coffee drinking to consumption of wine which was strictly prohibited. Around 1511, the governor of Mecca banned the use of coffee and shut down all the coffee houses. However, the governor’s ‘indiscreet zeal’ was disapproved of by his lord and master: the Sultan of Egypt. Coffee houses were reopened, but many activities such as gambling, singing, and dancing were forbidden.</p>

		<p>With the passage of time coffee drinking flourished and spread to other parts of Middle East, in spite of several attempts by the religious zealots to label the beverage as against the tenets of Islam. People of Constantinople took to the drink and the concept of coffee houses was elevated to a higher level. Kaveh Kanes became like clubs where like minded people could drink coffee and indulge in recreational conversation. In some of the coffee houses in Damascus there were orators who were hired to tell stories – ‘Thousand and One Nights’ being the favourite. Women too drank coffee but only in the privacy of their homes. Around the 17th century, refusal or denial of providing coffee for the wives was a legitimate cause for divorce amongst the Turkish men!</p>
			<p>Leonhard Rauwolf, a renowned German botanist was the first European to make a written mention of Kohwah in 1573. Venetian traders introduced coffee into Europe in 1615. They called the beverage ‘Cavee’ and it became trendy in Venice. With coffee becoming increasingly popular in Rome, it came under criticism by the clergy who denounced it as an invention of Satan! Pope Clement VIII was approached by the priests to prohibit the consumption of what they called the ‘Devil’s Drink’ by Christians. The priests further informed the Pope that the drink was being introduced by the infidels to entice Christians to fall into a trap set by Satan.</p>

			<p>Pope Clement VIII was curious and wanted to make a thorough study of this beverage. He asked for the concoction to be brought to him for inspection. The Pope found the aroma so pleasant and inviting that he was tempted to taste the drink. After drinking it he exclaimed: ‘Why, this Satan’s drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We shall fool the Satan by baptising it, and making it a truly Christian beverage.’ To the astonishment of the priests, Pope Clement VIII ceremoniously baptised coffee and proclaimed it as a truly ‘Christian beverage’. This papal act gave a strong fillip to coffee and its popularity started spreading all over Europe.</p>
			<p>The credit for establishing the first coffee house in the Western world goes to Italy, and they called it a Caffe. The French and the Austrians were quick to follow the Italians. They vastly improved upon the concept of coffee houses. European coffee houses attracted all classes of people. During the early part of the day came the merchants, lawyers, physicians, brokers, workers and wandering vendors. In the afternoons, and until the late hours came the leisure classes including the ladies.</p>
			<p>Even though many English travellers had knowledge of the beverage and had written about it, the first coffeehouse to be established in England was only in 1650 at Oxford. Coffee became very popular amongst the students at Oxford. It was only a matter of time before it spread to other parts of England and Ireland.</p>
			<p>Coffee was publicly sold in Holland in 1664 and coffee houses sprang up in various parts of the Country. However, the Dutch had started trading in coffee years earlier. With demand for the beverage increasing manifold, the Dutch experimented with growing the beans in Ceylon and in Java, Indonesia. Systematic cultivation of coffee was started in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1690.</p>
			<p>Coffee was introduced to America by Captain John Smith who in 1607 founded the colony of Virginia. With more and more immigrants flooding the Colony from Europe, coffee became as popular as tea. The United States of America is now a major consumer of this beverage.</p>
			<p>With the growing popularity of the refreshing drink, it soon attracted taxation. There was also constant slander and persecution of the beverage from certain quarters – especially the religious zealots in Arabia and Europe. There were also adverse propaganda and attacks on coffee by the pub and ale-house keepers who found their business being usurped by the coffee houses. But coffee withstood all these attempts to discredit it, and continued to gain further popularity. It became increasingly fashionable to drink coffee especially in coffee houses. With the passage of time various new techniques of brewing coffee emerged.</p>
			<p>By about 1715 there were reportedly more than 2000 coffee houses in London. During this critical period in English history people were tired of misgovernment and coffee houses became the sanctuary where political reforms were freely discussed. It is said that England’s great struggle for political liberty was actually fought and won in the coffee houses. Coffee soon acquired a reputation as a beverage which encouraged revolutionary thoughts and changes in society. Wherever coffee was consumed revolution was not far behind.</p>
			<p>By the nineteenth century coffee houses all over Europe were places where intellectuals gathered and discussed various issues. Newspapers became popular in coffee houses and many came to catch up with the latest news. There were several philosophers, writers, and artists who had their own favourite coffee house and anyone wanting to meet these gentlemen could do so at their most preferred haunts. There were animated discussions but unlike in the pubs and ale houses none were intoxicated. In Austria, some of the regulars such as psychologist Sigmund Freud had the name and address of their coffee houses printed on their letterheads.</p>

			<p>Demand for coffee started growing exponentially all over Europe and in their respective colonies. Coffee cultivation was started in various parts of Africa, South America and Asia.</p>
			<p>Modern coffee houses such as Starbucks, Costa, Barista, et al can be found all over the world, and coffee is witnessing a surge in consumption in all the emerging economies. Coffee is now associated with IT professionals who have named one of the main software languages after coffee, namely: Java. Computer programmers are known to consume large quantities of this refreshing beverage which stimulates their brains to come up with better programmes. It is now known as a drink favoured by the geeks. In India, Café Coffee Day has successfully catered to the need of the geeks, and one can find hordes of them spending hours over a cup of coffee in the ambiance of modern coffee houses.</p>
