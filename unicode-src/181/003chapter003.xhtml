		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Plantation Life in the 1880s</h1>
		<p>It was in eighties (1880s) that I came out to Coorg (Kodagu) for a visit and stayed for fifty years. Life in a coffee district in those days differed widely from that in towns and gay hill stations which offered a constant variety of amusements. Here, Europeans were sparse and widely scattered, and often a distance of twenty or thirty miles intervened between estates and European neighbours.</p>
		<p>Upon first coming out, therefore, a woman was apt to find life more than a little dull, especially if she had been brought up in a town. But she soon got used to changed conditions, and settled down quite contentedly to the quiet lot of a planter’s wife. The state of the crops, the aspect of the clouds, the conditions of coolie labour, and other matters incidental to coffee planting would gradually assume for her an all-absorbing interest, and in a year’s time she would probably wonder how any other life could have held any charms for her.</p>
		<p>On a coffee estate, the day began early. At six-thirty, one was wakened by the clanging of the estate bell, which summoned coolies to muster-roll before starting their day’s work. At the same hour, the early cup of tea materialised for the dorai and doraisanny (Master and Mistress). Then at seven, out on the verandah, chota hazri – a substantial meal of porridge, eggs and bacon, coffee and fruit. For the dorai there came the morning round on the estate. For his wife the walk, or ride, before engaging in the usual household routine, such as the ordering of meals, the weighing-out of all the commodities required for the day, seeing that the drinking water was boiled, and, by using a lactometer, finding out that the milk had not been watered, and so on.</p>

		<p>Then the twelve o’clock breakfast – usually a substantial meal of many courses, at which the dorai presented himself, hot and tired, after much wrestling with coolies and maistries.</p>
		<p>For those who were near tennis courts and men’s and women’s clubs, tennis, whist (bridge had not yet arrived), and billiards filled in the afternoons and evenings until the eight o’clock dinner. But for people like ourselves, miles away from such distractions, there was little to fill in the time beyond boring rambles on the estate until nightfall and, when alone, early to bed.</p>
		<p>The daily round varied according to the time of year. There were three seasons – the monsoon, from early June until September; the cold weather, from then until February; and the hot weather, until May. For the housewife, the monsoon was the most trying time if she were isolated from neighbours. Being the time for planting, her husband was fully occupied with estate work during the greater part of the day, so she had many lonely hours to put in. If, however, she developed a taste for gardening, she could pass many pleasant hours in pursuit of her hobby, and she was amply rewarded for the time and trouble which she lavished on her garden. Flowers grew in profusion, and after the rains a well-kept garden with its blaze of scarlet poinsettias, masses of delicate blue plumbago, tuberoses, heliotrope and gardenias, besides glowing beds of English annuals, presented a sight hard to beat for wealth and variety of colour.</p>
		<p><strong>The Scot Connection:</strong></p>
		<p>In our province, besides a fair sprinkling of Scots, there was quite a large element of Highlanders. This is explained by the fact that a native of Skye was one of the early pioneers of coffee in South India. Through his influence, many Highland boys gravitated to Coorg, where they found careers as planters. When sufficiently well off, they imported sisters who, in due course, married and had families. Thus, the Highland colony grew and multiplied. English people were apt to regard the Scots with a kindly tolerance.</p>
		<p><strong>Capital Capers:</strong></p>
		<p>Mercara (Madikeri) – the capital of the province – was a pleasant little station some twenty-five miles distant. It was mostly inhabited by government officials and a few retired planters.</p>
		<p>Here, during a few weeks in the hot weather, the Commissioner held court. Those of us who could not afford the more expensive sea changes to Colombo or Rangoon, usually gravitated to Mercara where, for about a month, we rented bungalows at exorbitant prices, paid calls on the residents according to Indian custom, wrote our names in the Commissioner’s book, and received invitations to the many gay activities got up for the benefit of visitors. These included dinners and dances, tennis tournaments and gymkhanas, race meetings and early morning riding picnics. As all this went on mostly without a break, we used to arrive back on the estate exhausted wrecks. It was, however, a wonderful change, and made up for many dull days throughout the year. By the time we returned, the hot weather was almost at its end, and the monsoon and hard work for the planter loomed near.</p>
		<p><strong>A New Year’s Party :</strong></p>
		<p>And then, a party given by Harry Graham to usher in the New Year stands out in my memory. Harry was a well-to-do bachelor who liked entertaining and who prided himself on doing things in better style than anyone else in the district. If a dinner is to be judged by the profusion of its courses, the splendid repasts at which we periodically assisted always excelled in this respect. Harry, being a Scot, was rather economical of speech, and we always figured at those symposiums because George, who never knew when to stop talking, was counted on to keep things going and talk agreeably to the ladies.</p>
		<p>In our district, my husband had a wholly exaggerated reputation as a witty conversationalist, which made him a welcome guest at any dinner table. Shortly after our marriage, I came to realise my own complete insignificance in the general scheme of things, and when we were asked to parties I knew full well that it was not owing to my own personal worth or charm, but because George could keep a dinner table interested and amused with a great deal of nonsense.</p>
		<p>On this occasion, we were told that oysters from the West Coast, sixty miles distant, were to be the chief item on the menu, and as there was no railway, coolie-runners were to be posted every five miles to ensure that the delicacies should arrive in a perfectly fresh condition. Humble people like ourselves had to be content with things out of a tin, presented in the guise of “oyster fatties” or “oyster escallops”, but to Harry, who was prosperous, expense was no object.</p>
		<p>We had a ride of eight miles to negotiate, and I remember I was strangely attired in a black lace evening dress covered with a riding apron, and a moth-eaten fur cape. This was to avoid the fag of changing, and bachelors’ bungalows in those days were rather deficient in bedroom appointments. But George elected to send his evening kit -which was packed in a flat tin box -on ahead. In Harry’s spare bedroom I was engaged in adjusting my hair in front of an inadequate glass with an eruption of black spots, which had an annoying habit of swinging round and hitting me on the face, when I heard a blast of lurid language issuing from the adjoining dressing room. On investigation, I found George in his shirt sleeves contemplating with horror the bodice of a pink satin evening dress, which he presently rolled into a tight ball and flung into the furthermost corner of the room. Other articles of female attire, such as a frilly petticoat, shoes and silk stockings received the same drastic treatment. I recognised the pink satin as the property of Mrs. Brown Jones whom I knew was due to dine at a bungalow eight miles away. The obvious solution was that our respective coolies had foregathered at a wayside arrack shop, and that in the darkness the boxes had got mixed up, for after all one flat tin box -the usual receptacle in those days for carrying clothes -was much like another. Although not naturally vindictive, the thought of Mrs. Brown Jones having to sit down to dinner in a tweed riding habit, amidst an assemblage of pretty frocks, did not excite my sympathy, for a month before she had not only bribed away my cook with the offer of bigger wages, but had by the same ignoble means lured away the only coolie on the premises who had the intelligence to comprehend the eccentricities of my Tamil. George, to his great annoyance, had to dine in his riding kit, as he was unable to borrow any garments from Harry who was of much shorter build.</p>
		<p>We all sat down expectantly to enjoy fresh oysters straight from the coast of Malabar. But the advent of the soup crushed our hopes, and we concluded that the coolies had not run fast enough. When Harry’s enquiries in an agitated whisper elicited the reply, “Please, sar, cook done make into oyster fatties”, our host sank back in his chair bereft of speech, and an apoplectic fit seemed imminent, while we ate our “fatties”, which we could have got at our own dinner tables any day of the week, with the contempt born of familiarity.</p>
		<p>During the next course, a collision occurred between two of the boys, resulting in the floor being decorated with foie gras in aspic and fragments of crockery. This time, Harry uttered a stream of horrible language under his breath. The foie gras, having been retrieved by the hands of native boys and presented to us, was not unnaturally declined by all, excepting George who, engaged in fluent conversation, remained undisturbed by the fact that he partook of food liberally coated with dust. The turkey was half raw, the curacoa soufflé watery, and the angels on horseback uneatable. It was clear on the face of it that Harry’s cook, who was really an excellent servant, had been “celebrating”, and I knew he would be summarily dealt with on the morrow.</p>
		<p>After dinner, George excelled himself. He sang five comic songs and, to the music of Mac’s bagpipes – played out on the terrace – he gave an exhibition of his own special interpretation of the sword dance, prancing round a carving knife and fork crossed like swords. In short, he monopolised the whole evening. At twelve o’clock the rum punch circulated, healths were drunk, and Auld Lang Syne sung with fervour. Soon afterwards we rode out into the night amidst a chorus of “Happy New Years”. At parting, our host wrung George’s hand and said he had been the life and soul of the evening, to which George replied modestly, “Do not mention it, old chappie”.</p>
		<p><strong>A Visitor Arrives:</strong></p>
		<p>Aunt Eliza happens to be one of those goody-goody people with a mania for reforming this wicked world. She thinks card-playing sinful. She regards non-teetotalers as on the straight road to perdition, and before she is half an hour in the bungalow she will probably ask you if you have found Christ.</p>
		<p>Aunt Eliza duly turned up some weeks before Christmas. Her arrival into our midst could hardly be described as a state entry. Out of pure goodness of heart, George drove out in his dogcart fifteen miles of the way to meet her. It will be an agreeable change after miles of jolting in a crawling cow carriage, he had said amiably that morning. But when I saw him tearing down the drive at a furious pace, Kitty, who was fresh and skittish, having done a little preliminary waltzing among my flower-beds, I was seized with misgivings as to the success of the enterprise. George was an utterly reckless driver, and truth compels me to state that the occasions on which I trusted myself to his care were fraught with such painful memories that, latterly, I preferred to take my drives abroad in a more safe, if less dashing, bullock vehicle.</p>
		<p>They were expected by tea-time. Long before that hour, however, I beheld Kitty galloping merrily up our drive, with fragments of George’s cherished dogcart dangling behind. By the time the grass-cutter had extricated the animal, Hussein the syce, breathless with much running, arrived and put me in possession of details. When passing a native village, the horse had shied at the sound of tom-toms, and the Sahib, being unprepared, she got out of hand and bolted. Rounding a corner, they were all three pitched out and Kitty galloped home. No one was hurt and the Sahib was able to engage a bandy (country cart) to bring the Mem Sahib home. Hussein’s report prepared me for the melancholy procession which, about an hour later, wended its way at a snail’s pace up our drive. Aunt Eliza, much dishevelled and looking the image of grim despair, sitting bolt upright in an empty, filthy manure cart and George, a disreputable-looking object with battered topi and dust-covered garments, walking gloomily behind.</p>
		<p>When Aunt Eliza had been with us for about a month, which seemed like years, Mac appeared on the scene. Mac, at that time, lived on one of the outlying estates, far removed from his own kind, and craving for a little excitement and change from the monotony of jungle life, he invited himself for the Christmas weekend. He was a popular favourite, especially with women, and Aunt Eliza succumbed at once to his fascination and charm of manner. He treated her with such courtly deference, and displayed such an interest in all the matters that she had so much at heart, that he went up in her estimation by leaps and bounds. He discussed foreign missions and temperance reform with a seriousness that might lead one to suppose he had given such matters his life long attention. With his tongue in his cheek, he deplored the giddy frivolity of our district. He sternly denounced Sunday tennis and card playing. And he informed her sadly of his vain efforts to rescue planters from their riotous and evil habits. Aunt Eliza was enchanted, and she expressed to me her gratification in at last meeting, in our benighted district, a man who could converse intelligently upon sane and ordinary topics, and whose mind soared above such imbecile matters as pig-sticking and shikar. She thought I ought to encourage his visits to our bungalow, because of the wholesome influence he was bound to exercise over poor George, who she feared was not really as serious-minded as he ought to be. I did not shatter her illusions by presenting her with my own private and unvarnished opinion of Mac, but inwardly I was amused at the idea of his being placed upon a pedestal high above my husband, who was a pillar of rectitude and virtue by comparison.</p>
		<p>But Mac’s fall was imminent. Christmas came and, as far as I was concerned, my Christmas dinner was emphatically not a success, for it had not proved the hilarious affair that custom had familiarised me with. The presence of my aunt had doubtless acted as a deterrent. But, as the meal progressed, and the champagne flowed, a certain liveliness manifested itself (we had several men-guests), and aunt Eliza’s usually austere and disapproving manner was considerably mellowed by the glasses of milk punch with which Mac plied her, insisting that it was quite a harmless concoction, composed exclusively of milk and lemons. Under its influence, she became loquacious, and in a semi-intoxicated condition she discoursed with eloquence on the need for temperance in India. I was too weighed down by my responsibilities as hostess (two courses at least had turned out failures) to perceive what Charlie was up to, but I dealt severely with him on the following day.</p> 
		<p>Christmas Day fell on a Saturday, which was unfortunate, because it meant that if they sat up late they would be desecrating the Sabbath. Not, unfortunately, that this troubled any of us, for the Sabbath was like any other day. But I wished Aunt Eliza’s feelings to be respected. We both retired early. My aunt was nodding in her chair, and I conducted her gently to bed. The rest of the party retired to the verandah, where I knew from past experience that they intended to make a night of it. They behaved exactly according to my expectations. Loud bursts of laughter, gay sing-songs, mostly out of the Students’ Song Book, somebody performing on a mouth-organ, the “boy” being constantly called for to replenish whiskies and sodas.</p>
		<p>At one o’clock in the morning the noise was deafening. I hoped very much that the milk punch would have had a soporific effect upon Aunt Eliza and induce a deep sleep, for in an Indian bungalow it is impossible to deaden sound. At two o’clock in the morning, the noise still went on, even louder. I donned a dressing-gown and went out to request less noise, and to suggest that our guests should depart. But the effects of the milk punch had been more transient than I had hoped, for I found my aunt -a strange looking object in a pink flannelette dressing gown -standing at the drawing room door, looking out in complete bewilderment. Mac, at the moment, was emulating Lottie Collins, then at the zenith of her fame, by dancing a kind of skirt dance to the strains of a gramophone.</p>
		<p>Mac, being Highland, always affected a kilt for evening wear, and as he manipulated it in the course of the dance, he raised it higher than accorded with the canons of decency. When he caught sight of my aunt, he, nothing daunted, staggered up to her, made a very low bow and, smiling fatuously, asked her for the pleasure of a dance. But the bow was so profound that, because of his semi-intoxicated condition, he overbalanced and fell on his head at her feet. Too many whisky pegs had proved his undoing. Aunt Eliza rushed from the scene in terror, and a solemn hush fell upon the party, which broke up shortly afterwards. My aunt left two days later to stay at the house of a Scottish missionary in Madras where -she said sadly -she hoped to find herself in more congenial surroundings. I never heard from her again.</p>
		<p><strong>A Wedding:</strong></p>
		<p>It was a relief when they became engaged. It was a still greater relief when the marriage had to be rushed on to coincide with the Madras padre’s annual visit. For, in the backwoods, padres were rare in those days, and christenings and marriages had to be arranged to synchronise with their visits. Funerals were conducted without benefit of clergy, the service being always read by a planter. And so, Veronica had to dispense with a trousseau and a white satin dress, but it mattered little since most of her Bond Street clothes were still intact.</p>
		<p>The church was miles away, and we held the reception at the Club, as being central and more accessible to the guests who thronged from every corner of the district and who arrived in a curious variety of vehicles. Coaches, tongas, bandies, all bullock-drawn, lurched up to the church, whilst a waggonette and a few dogcarts imparted a touch of elegance. The clothes worn by many of the men presented a delightful variety. Some came in their smart volunteer uniforms. Some looked odd and prehistoric in shabby morning coats and large pith sun topees. The only top hat which the district could muster -a shabby affair of a former decade -was borrowed by the bridegroom.</p>
		<p>At the reception, as the champagne flowed, many of the men got rather disorderly.</p>
		<p>The bride and bridegroom were driven away in the waggonette. The rice throwing and the shouting, added to the fact that two of the hilarious guests insisted upon climbing into the waggonette, maddened the horses. They plunged and tried to rear until, finally, getting out of hand, they bolted down the hill in a cloud of red dust, the bride and bridegroom and the two lively men clinging wildly to one another. That was my last sight of Veronica, until their return from the Nilgiris, a month later.</p>
		<p><strong>Blossom Showers:</strong></p>
		<p>I remember one year when the showers were absolutely right for us -neither too heavy nor too light -although our two neighbouring estates came off badly. At last, we thought, Heaven had been in our favour, for during the past few seasons things on the estate had worked out at a loss. So, on the day the blossom was fully out, I accompanied George when he went round the entire estate to make his estimate. We rode through acres of coffee bushes which were smothered in a glory of snow-white bloom. The flower, which bears a strong resemblance to jasmine, grows in small clusters along the branches, and its perfume is rather overpowering. That morning, the estate presented a brave show under its lovely mantle of foamy white.</p>
		<p>Barring inopportune happenings, George estimated the crop likely to accrue at fifty tons, and as the utmost Bunagiri had ever achieved was twenty-five, we returned home well satisfied with our morning’s expedition. That evening, after dinner, we sat out on the verandah and engaged in the pleasant task of building air castles. The night was beautifully clear and cool, and myriads of stars hung in a blue-black sky. Fire-flies darted about like jewels, lizards rustled in the bignonia creeper, bull-frogs croaked in the pot plants edging the verandah, and the air was heavy with the strong sickly scent of coffee blossom. But to scents and sounds we were quite oblivious, being busy weaving plans for next year’s hot weather, by which time our fifty-ton crop would have materialised. Of course, we visualised a trip home to see the twins who, naturally, would be overjoyed to see their parents, from whom they had been so long separated. We would arrange to arrive in time to see the daffodils and tulips blooming in the London parks.</p>
		<p>Then we proceeded to draw out a glittering programme of all the exciting things we intended doing during our six months’ leave. In imagination we flitted about from one gay and crowded scene to another, and Epsom, Ascot and Goodwood were, in their turn, to be graced by our presence. George sighed happily and said how good it would be to eat decent English beef and drink fine English beer again. My own tastes were less vulgar and inclined to mayonnaise of salmon that had never seen the inside of a tin, and strawberries and cream. Following our giddy round of gaieties in England, there would come the heavenly calm of August and September in the Highlands. This part of the programme was more pleasing to me than the orgy of gaieties which we had arranged to participate in. In imagination, I was back again among the hills and the glens, breathing in, not the sickly perfume of coffee blossom, but the clean, wholesome smell of heather and peat and bog myrtle, and the tang of salt sea-breezes.</p>
		<p>We retired early, having spent a highly agreeable evening. At about midnight I was awakened by the sound of heavy rain beating down upon the shingled roof. After an excessively hot day, the sound seemed pleasant, bringing a promise of coolness, but I thought the stream of blasphemy that issued from the next bed strange and quite uncalled for. Then I suddenly came to, and remembered that the blossom was out and had not had time to set, and that heavy rain on it spelt, if not ruin, at least an insignificant crop. It would have been futile for me to utter the consoling words, “Never mind, darling, we at least have each other”, for they would not have been received in the spirit in which they were offered.</p>
		<p>Next morning the rain-guage registered nearly two inches of rain, which meant the destruction of about half the crop.</p>
		<p>Such a contingency was not unusual in coffee-growing districts. There were other drawbacks which might have to be faced throughout the year to prevent the realisation of a planter’s fond dreams. An unfavourable monsoon, for instance, or a bad attack of leaf disease, or an epidemic of the dreaded borer fly, not to mention a sudden fall in the price of coffee in the London market. Fortunately, however, most planters were the possessors of hopeful temperaments, which helped to carry them through the difficulties with which the thorny path of coffee-growing was beset. And if things went wrong, there was always a “next year” to look forward to.</p>
		<p><strong>A Picnic On The Cauvery:</strong></p>
		<p>The River Cauvery rises in the province of Coorg. It is called the Ganges of the South, and devout Hindus make annual pilgrimages to its source and bathe in its waters. In its course through the province, it is tortuous and its bed rocky. Its banks are covered with luxuriant vegetation, a large part of which consists of bamboos. Once, and only once, did we ever picnic on its banks, for it was some distance away, and the roads not too good. Then, a group of men calling themselves Tritons, because their estates extended for some miles along the riverside, conceived the idea of inviting the community to a river picnic. It was the height of the hot weather, always a dull and slack time for those of us who had not gone on holiday. We accepted the invitation with alacrity, and I visualised a lovely, peaceful day on a quiet river-bank, away from coffee and coolies.</p>
		<p>It took us over an hour in a jolting bullock tonga to achieve our destination. We drove through some miles of shady estates, across stretches of paddy fields and, finally, through tracts of thick jungle. The river-bank looked like a fair. Dogcarts, tongas and bullock coaches were all cluttered about, while the drivers with their animals sheltered in the shade of thickly foliaged trees. Further down the bank, on a green sward backed by large clumps of bamboo, the guests were assembled. The river looked cool and placid, if rather muddy. Farther downstream, dhobis washed clothes, beating them vigorously against stones. A group of Indian women in bright coloured saris washed their brass cooking pots. Ugly black buffaloes wallowed in the water for coolness. On the spot selected for tiffin, all was noise and hubbub. Some two dozen boys (each guest brought his own servant) unpacked hampers and issued orders in raucous Tamil to the numerous coolies in attendance.</p>
		<p>We all settled down in small groups to discuss the latest “gup”, but Mrs. Brown Jones (who had once bagged my cook) took up an aloof position on a branch which overhung the river and surveyed the proceedings with cold disdain. It was always a deep mystery to us why this woman, whose father was a London Universal Provider and a Jew (this she did not like to be known, so we considered her an unworthy member of a great race) should think herself better than the rest of us who, though mere Gentiles, were mostly of quite respectable origin. But she had a fat income of her own, and she could afford to get her clothes from Paris, whilst most of us women, what with husbands who drew small salaries, and many with children at home, were deadly poor, and so we had to be content with “verandah-made” garments which had little of “chic” about them. As Mrs. Brown-looking very elegant in a pale green embroidered muslin -posed on her branch, it unfortunately proved unstable and snapped. With a shriek she fell into the river, which was deep in that particular part; also crocodiles were not unknown.</p>
		<p>We all rushed to the edge of the steep bank to look with horror on the struggling figure. It was surprising that, of all the men who ostentatiously called themselves Tritons, not one of them could swim. So it was left to Mac to plunge into the river and effect a rescue. When they were both hauled up the steep bank they were wet to the skin. The women led Mrs. Brown Jones into the privacy of a clump of bamboos and helped to divest her of her wet garments, which were spread out to dry. The supply of clothes that could be lent to her for the time being was naturally limited. One lady contributed her much befrilled nainsook petticoat, and another a short box-cloth cape, much in vogue at that period, which she had brought with her as a protection from the night air during her drive home. Mac was led into another bamboo grove to disrobe, but little in the way of male attire with the exception of a blazer and a cummerbund could be offered him. Trousers being unavailable, a tonga dust rug was requisitioned which, when fastened with safety pins, helped to cover his limbs. In this quaint attire he strode about quite unconcerned, just as if they had been his everyday garments.</p>
		<img src="images/0011.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Presently, Mrs. Brown Jones rushed shrieking out of her grove, and said a cobra was sitting up in a corner wagging his head at her. An inspection revealed the cobra, hood extended and ready to strike. On the instant all was pandemonium. There were no suitable implements at hand to keep the reptile at bay, but two brave men seized the boat oars which they brandished wildly. Another, observing that snakes were hypnotised by music, seized the tea-kettle and banged it with a spoon. A resourceful boy, anticipating an attack, had the tablecloth ready to fling it over the enemy and engulf it in its folds, while coolies shouted and gathered branches to ward off an attack. The snake seemed to regard with some surprise the vast army of human beings arrayed against him and the very peculiar tactics which they adopted, and perceiving that the contest was quite unequal, he slithered away into the jungle in disgust.</p>
		<p>So much exhausting work seemed to call for aperitifs which, in the case of the men, took the form of whisky pegs. Then came tiffin, which was excellent. Lobster salad, chicken in aspic, cold saddle of mutton, curry puffs (these were made of pastry enclosing curried mince, and very good) and an assortment of cold sweets figured on the menu and, as we sat round a groaning table-cloth, a holy calm seemed to descend upon the company, and all became engrossed in the business of eating.</p>
		<p>Presently, a man, when he had apparently eaten to repletion, decided to break the solemnity of the proceedings by hitting Mac on the nose with a hot baked potato. Mac -quite roused -retaliated by hurling the cold fowl in front of him at the culprit. Then the fun began. Rolls, potatoes, curry puffs and other eatables were flung about with great dexterity. The attendant coolies -hands clapped to mouths -giggled at the strange proceedings, but the white-robed “boys” remained impassive. They, doubtless, thought it regrettable that their masters should comport themselves with such an utter lack of dignity. Such riotous conduct on the part of planters seemed to have been regarded with indulgence in the eighties. People argued that young men, isolated for a week or more on outlying estates, had to have an outlet for their high spirits somehow when they emerged from their seclusion, and flinging food about was, perhaps, as harmless as any other diversion. But a visitor, up from Madras, who removed herself from the line of fire and hid behind a banyan tree, was heard to say that she could never make out why planters were held in such low esteem in the cities, but that now she knew!</p>
		<p>I was quite pleased to get back to the quiet of my own home -for the peaceful picnic which I had looked forward to had not materialised. It had held too many exciting incidents.</p>
		<p><strong>Life’s Little Difficulties:</strong></p>
		<p>But life in our province was not always light-hearted and carefree. It often had its tragic side. There were, occasionally, epidemics of cholera, when coolies were found dead or dying by the roadside, and when Europeans in outlying districts often succumbed for want of medical care. For, with only one doctor over a wide area and only coolie runners to summon him, he would arrive after a long ride to find the patient either dead or dying. Once we had a bad epidemic of a virulent type of smallpox, a deadly scourge which natives made no effort to avoid. I think it was because they worshipped the Goddess of Destruction, called Kali. And in those faraway days, inoculation was almost unheard of.</p>
		<p>Once a planter’s wife, who lived quite near us, died of the disease. She had contracted it from her ayah. The memory of her funeral still haunts me, for most of the women of the district turned out to pay their last respects to one who had been a great favourite. The funeral was held by torchlight that same night. In the tropics the dead have to be buried at once, and the cemetery was some distance away. The service was read by a planter, and the ceremony made an unforgettable impression as the torches and lanterns flickered in darkness and pouring rain.</p>
		<p>Then there were the many occasions when men died, leaving wives and children ill provided for. I allude to superintendents and salaried manager who had not been able to save enough money for their dependents. In such cases there would follow the usual pathetic procedure. The widow’s list sent round the district, or a sale held at her bungalow, when curious people would turn up to view her cherished possessions, which would probably include most of her wedding presents. Then a cheap passage home for herself and her children, to face a new and hard life among strangers, carrying with her poignant memories of happy days that would never return. Always they went home, those tragic widows. Indeed, there was no other resource left to them in those days, for there was little they could do to earn a livelihood in India.</p>
