		<p>The primary coffee growing areas in India are located in the Western Ghats in southern India – these areas are popularly referred to as the ‘traditional’ planting areas, while the ‘new’ areas are those pockets in the Eastern Ghats in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, and in the North-Eastern States of India where coffee growing has, since the 1950s, been encouraged by the Government of India to support income generation specially in tribal areas.</p>
		<p>The traditional areas are naturally where coffee cultivation over the years became an economic, social, cultural and lifestyle phenomenon. Pioneer British planters started the commercial production of coffee in the late 1820s, primarily in Chikmagalur and Coorg (Kodagu). By 1870, around 1,20,000 hectares had been planted with coffee. Subsequently, pests, disease and poor prices whittled down the plantations, reaching a low of 72,400 hectares in 1941. </p>
		<p>During the last 60 years, significant strides have been made in the development of disease-resistant varieties of coffee and in plantation management practices, with the research and extension wings of the Coffee Board of India playing a pivotal role. Today, India has nearly 3,90,000 hectares of private coffee plantations, a majority of which are in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</p>
		<p>Over a span of nearly two hundred years, the coffee industry has integrated seamlessly into the region, such that today, the plantations are as natural as the rain-forests, and coffee itself is now crucial to the ecology of the Western Ghats.</p>
		<p>The credit for instituting a tradition of sustainability must surely go to the thousands of individual coffee planters, as well as the large and medium plantation companies who have integrated sustainability into their processes, from a production as well as a lifestyle perspective.</p>
		<p>Sustainability is a natural outcome of one of the most important requirements for coffee planting – shade. Indian coffee is one hundred per cent shade-grown, and we owe it to the pioneer planters who, during the period 1820–70 cleared tracts of land for cultivation, yet maintained the second and third tiers of shade trees. So while coffee bushes, inter-cropped with pepper vines are at the base level, the tall ficus, white cedars and mahogany trees form the double and triple layer canopies that are seen throughout the coffee regions, especially at higher elevations. The coffee plantations in the region are demonstrably some of the world’s finest acres of sustainable agriculture.</p>
		<p>This has given India a unique heritage of sustainable coffee production; the subsequent advances in research and technology have only added layers of sophistication to the natural processes instituted in the early years of development. Shade-grown coffee, much desired internationally, is what gives Indian coffee its cache and distinguishes it from other origins in the global market.</p>
		<p>The Indian coffee planter is not just savvy about the concept of shade contributing to high-quality coffee, he is equally respectful of his natural surroundings, and has over time adopted a lifestyle to make the most of his habitat, and preserve it for tourists and visitors to enjoy.</p>

		<p>The coffee growing districts represent some of the best natural forest reserves anywhere in the world, and a real treasure-house for trekkers, bird-watchers and wildlife enthusiasts. The estates co-exist side-by-side with national parks teeming with flora and fauna. Wild boars and elephants still roam freely through the plantations and, being 100 per cent tree-shaded, the coffee estates support extensive bird-life.</p>
		<p>Ornithologists have conclusively proved that one need not go only to bird sanctuaries to observe birds – a coffee estate would do as well! During the monsoons, the tree cover acts as a sponge and later feeds life-giving water to the east and west flowing rivers.</p>
		<p>A recent trend in the core coffee regions has been the shift to organic cultivation. Several committed growers have adopted various methods of organic cultivation, ranging from non-use of chemical inputs to proactive biodynamic processes. Conversion of farms and estates to organic methods has in fact improved the soil quality and rejuvenated the land, resulting in a greener environment with more birds and butterflies besides healthier plants. Organic cultivation has increased the value of the produce, and has contributed towards even more sustainable coffee plantation.</p>
		<p>So integral is coffee to the ecology of the Western Ghats that any change in land-use could have serious consequences in an area that is considered one of the world’s hot-spots in terms of bio-diversity.</p>
		<p>Looking beyond the idyllic landscapes, there is cause for concern, as coffee regions face threats due to various factors. While coffee consumption is growing both in the domestic as well as in the international markets, coffee growers face a number of challenges. There is an enormous strain on the land, with coffee growers trying hard to cope with the increasing costs of production and shortage of labour. Coffee cultivation is highly labour intensive, and in the old days it was common to find three generations working on the same estate. Today, thanks to education and improved opportunities, the aspirations of the younger generation have increased, and many are moving out to urban centres in search of more profitable work. Coffee growers are finding it harder and harder to find hands to harvest their crops in the peak season, and the economics of cultivation are increasingly problematic.</p>

		<p>Good quality land for coffee cultivation is already saturated, and with increasingly stringent environment regulations that require preservation of natural resources and demarcation of no-go areas, further expansion looks improbable. Given the increase in land prices, even existing areas under cultivation closer to urban settlements would probably provide better yields through real estate development.</p>
		<p>All the more reason to preserve the coffee habitat, for if the industry suffers, the impact on the environment will be as severe as it will be on the local community.</p>
		<p>Today, India has around 2,20,000 coffee holdings, with more than 98 per cent being owned by small growers holding 10 hectares or less, micro-enterprise at its best. Estate labour accounts for over 5,35,000 persons. Factor in the number of dependants and those directly or indirectly involved with the industry and a potentially explosive picture emerges.</p>
		<p>Yet, the Indian coffee grower is a survivor, and coffee is not just a business, but a way of life! Many enlightened planters are now diversifying their activities. While coffee is still the mainstay, spice cultivation, floriculture, plantation tourism…all these are making waves in the coffee lands. The net result is that the coffee country of India is on the path to rejuvenation and greater bio-diversity – adding new dimensions, yet again, to the natural heritage. With its sustainable coffee economy, the coffee districts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are justifiably recognised as a national asset – a unique case of Nature and commerce in harmony.</p>
