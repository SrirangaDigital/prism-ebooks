		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Café Culture in India</h1>
		<p>The first decade of the 21st century can truly be termed the Decade of Coffee in India. The yearly domestic consumption of coffee in India rose to 94,400 tonnes in 2008, a positive change since 1998, when consumption was static at 50,000 tonnes per annum.</p>
		<p>Liberalisation of the Indian coffee industry in 1996 significantly altered the landscape for coffee growers and exporters, as well as retailers. Today, the coffee retail scene in India is thriving like never before. The growth rate in recent years is estimated at a healthy 6% per annum, bringing India squarely onto the radar of global coffee companies as a consuming, and not just a producing, country. With a consumer middle class estimated at around 350 million, it appears that India’s potential is just being realised.</p>
		<p>The most dramatic representation of Indian coffee has emerged through the cafés that today occupy practically every street corner in urban India, with the burgeoning coffee bars being identified as one of the more visible signs of a booming consumer economy.</p>
		<p>Throughout history, across continents, coffee bars have been places to talk and pass time, romance and revolutionise. India, too, has its own special café culture, spanning some three generations, with traditional and contemporary avatars.</p>

		<p><strong>India Coffee House – An Institution: </strong></p>
		<p>The golden age of the coffee house in India belongs undeniably to the India Coffee House, which had its hey day from the 1940s through the 1970s. The first India Coffee House opened on Churchgate Street in Bombay on 28th September 1936, and quickly became a rendezvous for an entire generation swept up in the political maelstrom of pre-Independent India and through to the revolutionary sixties. The outlets were part of a larger strategy to promote coffee consumption in India, and the India Coffee House chain, later operated by the Coffee Board, reached a peak of 72 outlets, before getting downsized, as the younger generation in India took to colas and carbonated drinks.</p>
		<p><strong>Coffee Bars – The Contemporary Scene:</strong></p>
		<p>A fresh new aroma wafted in during the 1990s, with a whole new trend in coffee retailing in India. Coffee bars today capture the spirit of the age, not only because of the customer profile, but also in terms of the entrepreneurial flair that is demonstrably on show.</p>
		<p>The trail of the reinvented coffee shop starts in Bangalore, the IT Capital and the Coffee Capital of India. The Café Coffee Day on Brigade Road, Bangalore happens to be the first ‘cybercafe’ in the Country, where the contemporary trend in coffee-pubbing started, and it now has a special place in the history of coffee retailing in India. Launched by the Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co. (ABC), in November 1996, the retail concept fused two distinct trends – the cyber craze and the yen for gourmet coffee – and the independent, stand-alone coffee joint, rather, cybercafé, was born.</p>
		<p>Having pioneered the modern coffee retail format in India, Café Coffee Day (CCD) has been hugely successful: as of January 2011 the company had some 1,040 outlets in India, clearly the leading coffee retailer in the Country, the third in Asia, and the fifth in the world! Café Coffee Day has also ventured overseas, and operates cafés in Vienna, Austria and Karachi. Expansion is planned across the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Egypt and South East Asia in the coming years.</p>

		<p>The word ‘Barista’ means ‘a bartender/expert in the brewing and making of coffee’, and is Italian in origin. The credit for raising the profile of coffee retailing in India goes to Barista Coffee Company, which opened shop in New Delhi in March 2000. Over the years, there have been ownership and management changes: the original promoters, Turner Morrison and Co., sold out to the Chennai-based Sterling Infotech Group; and in March 2007, Lavazza, Italy’s largest coffee company, made a strategic entry into India by taking over Barista. Currently there are over 200 Barista Lavazza Espresso Bars and Barista Crème Lavazza’s in over 30 cities in India. Barista Lavazza also has cafés in locations across Sri Lanka, Oman and the UAE.</p>
		<p>Besides the big two, CCD and Barista Lavazza, several other retailers currently liven up the coffee scene in India. There’s Costa, part of UK-based Whitbread plc, which has a franchise agreement with RJ Corporation’s subsidiary DIL in India, currently operating around 100 outlets in Indian metros; Qwiky’s which set up its first coffee pub in Chennai in October 1999, and operates on a franchise basis; Javagreen, part of the Reliance World stores of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), Coffee World, a venture of Global Franchise Architects (GFA), Cafe Mocha, with its flagship store in Mumbai’s Churchgate area, living up to its “coffees and conversations” tagline; Kalmane Koffee, a speciality roaster retailer based in Bangalore; Gloria Jean’s, the Australian coffee franchise, which is now present in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai; Italian coffee major Illycaffe which sources significant quantities of Arabica and Robusta from India, and is now partnering with the Narang group to set up its Espressamente Illy outlets – the first of which is visible at the Bengaluru International Airport, and Coffee Bean &#38; Tea Leaf, US-based family-run company with an international footprint, which now has outlets in Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata. Besides the chain stores, several independents have staked out their turf in big cities, such as Moca Cafe in Chennai.</p>
		<p>The year 2011 started with a bang when US coffee chain Starbucks finally announced in January its much-awaited entry into India on the back of an alliance with Tata Coffee, an agreement which includes sourcing of green coffee beans, roasting and café operations.</p>
		<p>All these contemporary coffee chains initially had one thing in common – they all went unabashedly for young throats! The outlets are designed for young people in the age group of 15-29 to hang out – preferably for hours, no sweat. With air-conditioning and music, message boards full of wise-cracks, indoor games such as chess, scrabble and Pictionary; these pubs are virtually an extension of the college canteen, but thoroughly upscale versions.</p>
		<p>Yet, as the consumer matured, all the major coffee chains in India have experimented with and launched several other formats, catering to a wider audience, including executives and families. Interiors have been suitably adapted, with the lounge format currently in vogue. Several new cafés have come up in the new and refurbished airports in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and New Delhi, which cater to passengers in transit.</p>
		<p>Sub-continental scale makes café culture in India extremely diverse. Traditional dhabas and darshinis, the Indian version of fast food joints, co-exist alongside the new Western-style cafés. Yet for retail opportunists, it’s evident that the emerging café scene holds great promise, with franchisees said to be making a 15-20% annual profit.</p>
		<p>The twist is that coffee retailers don’t make money on the coffee service alone, as food service also plays an important role. For young people these days in India, chilling out at a coffee bar is more of a lifestyle thing, a convenient hangout. From serving snacks and short eats, mostly Western-style burgers and sandwiches, the stores have introduced soups, salads and pasta, not to mention ‘wraps’ which in essence are kaati rolls! Indianising and indigenising the menu has been crucial to increasing footfalls at these cafés.</p>
		<p>At the same time, the taste, palate and vocabulary of the Indian coffee consumer has become increasingly sophisticated, with people perfectly comfortable with ‘origins’ such as Colombia or Coorg, blends of different beans such as Arabica and Robusta, and preparations such as Italian espresso or macchiato or authentic South Indian filter coffee. Valentine’s Day is not complete without a heart shape in the coffee cup demonstrating the Barista’s proficiency in latte art, or a discerning consumer choosing to patronise a store that boasts of a particular brand of espresso machine!</p>
		<p>In the process, we’ve been witness to the evolution of the coffee house format as exemplified by the India Coffee House that served one standard house blend, to a trendy bar that serves a variety of beverages and snacks. The espresso counter is a focal element, with the full range of gourmet coffees on order. Urban youth of every new generation always tend to stake out a certain public space as their own; certainly the coffee pubs in the Indian metros are the social milieu where the bold and the beautiful get together today. Further, an Indian twist – the accent is on conviviality, on group activity – way different from the coffee pubs in the Western world which are designed for the individual wanting a quick, quiet cuppa.</p>
		<p>For young people these days, chilling out at a coffee pub is more of a lifestyle thing, and has more “added value” than simply sipping a cola or a lemon drink. The contemporary coffee bar scene in India today spells non-stop excitement! As each chain expands, each new store opening becomes a frothy celebration of India’s own brand of coffee culture.</p>
