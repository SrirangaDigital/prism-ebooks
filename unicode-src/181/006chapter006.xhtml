		<p><em>Dr. Anand Titus Pereira has a Ph.D. in Microbiology. His wife, Geeta Nanaiah Pereira has an M.S.degree in Horticulture from the Oklahoma State University, U.S.A. This husband and wife team owns a model coffee farm in the foothills of the Western Ghats in Sakleshpur Taluk of Hassan District of Karnataka. </em></p>
		<p><em>They have worked diligently on sustainable technologies for the past 15 years and have come out with various practical recommendations which are of great benefit to coffee farmers world-wide. They are regular contributors to coffee-related publications and periodically present lectures on the intrinsic value of shade grown coffee. </em></p>
		<p>India has been home to coffee for almost 200 years and it has always been, and still remains, shade grown. However, with the winds of globalisation and liberalisation reaching Indian shores, forest grown Indian coffee is making inroads in the West as a speciality coffee. The coffee grown under the shade of forest trees has a unique taste of Nature in the cupping quality. There are three key ideas here. This uniqueness is not only the result of the forest factor but also due to the fact that the coffee habitats are an integral part of multi-crops, herbs and spices. In addition, Indian coffee plantations harbour thousands of species of old, diverse and significant species of rare birds, insects and endangered wildlife. Nature lovers can appreciate the beauty and variety of trees by simply taking a walk inside the shade grown Indian coffee plantation. It is like walking hand in hand with nature. One can hear different species of birds singing, especially at dawn and at dusk. We are greeted with a sonata of natural sounds. The amazing fact is that coffee habitat and nature bring out the best chemistry in sustaining each other’s needs. Many foreigners who visit the plantations, remark that Indian coffee plantations are bird and game sanctuaries. The architectural detail of the coffee mountain is astounding.</p>

		<p>This article is intended to be an eye-opener, or a window to the world of coffee lovers worldwide, in allowing them to appreciate the role of Indian coffee farmers in maintaining the fragile forest cover and its inhabitants. It provides an opportunity to observe the complexity of Nature, both on the forest floor and the coffee canopy. With the unique flora and fauna, the coffee mountain allows one to experience the sights, sounds, smells and life of the forest canopy.</p>

		<p>Fifty years ago, the plantation scene was totally different. Our forefathers were sensible people. Men with vision and uncommon commonsense. They had the ‘Live and let live’ approach at the back of their mind. One could see leopards, tigers, elephants, rabbits, bison, sambar, reptiles, spotted deer, wild boars, green pigeons, and cranes, at the waterholes inside the plantation. Literally, every plantation with its extensive lakes provided a safe haven for wildlife.</p>

		<p>During the migration periods as well as during the mating season, seldom would any planter venture out hunting. Also, during the hunting season, care was taken such that the female of the species was not hunted down. Wild fruit trees were allowed to grow in the valleys along with shrubs and herbs and this thick jungle of shrubs and thorn bushes used to be the lodge as well as food baskets for wildlife.</p>
		<p>The big cats were selectively shot only because they were man eaters. Planters never killed wildlife indiscriminately. They never used to overdo things. Today the situation is pathetic. The forest itself is in trouble. The wildlife numbers have declined alarmingly due to hunting and clearing of restricted zones within the coffee forest. Deforestation and extension of plantations has also made the task of conserving that much more difficult. Migrations are earmarked as opportunities for poaching. All that remains are fragments of a once pristine wildlife habitat.</p>

		<p>Extension of coffee plantations too is an undesirable trait because it leads to mechanisation of the forest in terms of levelling and clearing of shrubs and exposing the virgin land to direct sunlight. Dr. Romulus Whitaker, a leading conservationist, is of the opinion that the Western Ghats is one of the largest unbroken pieces of forest. Cutting even a single tree in the dense Western Ghats can cause severe damage to thousands of beneficial microorganisms. The destruction of the natural environment has been rapid in the last five decades.</p>

		<p><strong>Environmental Crisis: </strong></p>
		<p>Coffee farmers are increasingly diverting their attention towards short-term profits. On the one hand, they are indiscriminately cutting native trees and on the other, replanting the soil with saplings like eucalyptus, mangium, mesopsis, acacia, delonix, feltoforum, and other species meant for the restoration of desert soils.</p>
		<p>Instead of contributing to the soil fertility they degrade the soil and also remove water from the groundwater table. In the bargain the self-supporting stability of natural forests decline. We firmly believe that the greatest threat to this fragile planet in the 21st century is the destruction of coffee forests and creation of mono-cropped forests. Imagine millions of acres of pine, eucalyptus, acacia or mangium forests. They do not support any other plant or animal life.</p>
		<p>Forest nurseries and private nurseries need to propagate the native forest trees which contribute thousands of tonnes of biomass and periodically rejuvenate the soil system. So coffee farmers need to prepare and preserve the seeds of these traditional varieties of hardwood and semi-hardwood species which act as rain harvesters and enrich the fertility status of the soil.</p>
