		<p>Cradled by the verdant Western Ghats, coffee forests are an ecological wonderland, fed as they are by more than a dozen rivers, the majority, taking birth in the high ranges of the Ghats. Most of the year, except during the monsoons, you will find it tranquil, almost gentle, yet the power behind the sight is unmistakable.</p>
		<p>Amidst untamed patches of greenery one can discover coffee forests with their enchanting landscape teeming with varied flora and fauna. These coffee forests provide an incredible opportunity for the Nature lover to study hundreds of species of endangered birds and animals. The great physical variations in topography from the high-range mountains to the low-lying plains and the formation of multiple watersheds is responsible for local variation in species diversity.</p>
		<p>A study of the coffee forests reveals very interesting facts. Coffee forests have varied physical and climatic conditions and types of vegetation. Two factors play a key role in coffee forests accommodating distinctive types of flora and fauna. Most of the coffee forests are zones with an elevation ranging from 950 m MSL going up to 1500 m MSL receiving very high rainfall. These forests have three-storied vegetation accommodating multi-crops and various types of flora and fauna.</p>
		<p>The upper storey or top storey consists of tall evergreen trees which belong mostly to the hard wood species. More than 60 per cent of the sunlight is trapped by this canopy of trees. Trees of medium growth belonging to the semi-hard wood species form the middle tier. These trees grow luxuriantly in moderate shade. The third layer consists of introduced species which are not permanent in nature. This three-tiered shade system acts as a sanctuary for birds and animals of all kinds, both ground dwellers as well as tree dwellers by providing adequate food and protection.</p>

		<p>The Western Ghats, one of the eight hot spots of biodiversity in the world, are home to shade grown eco friendly coffee plantations. The exciting news is that these evergreen tropical forests are proposed to be included in the list of world heritage sites. To date there are six natural heritage sites in India which include the Valley of Flowers, the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Kaziranga National Park, Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, Sunderban and Keoladeo National Park. These spectacular ghats comprising of mountain ranges, steep valleys, rivers, rivulets and pristine forests cover an area of about 1,60,000 square km and stretch forth 1,600 km from the Southern tip at Kanyakumari to Gujarat.</p>
		<p>The Western Ghats, otherwise referred to as the Sahyadri Hills are formed by the Malabar Plains and the mountains running parallel to the West Coast of India. These pristine coffee forests are part and parcel of the massive protected Nilgiri Biosphere (5,520 square km) reserve, which is Indiaâ€™s first biosphere reserve. The Bandipur National Park (874 square km.) flanked by Nagarahole or Rajiv Gandhi National Park (643.39 square km), Mudhumalai Wildlife Sanctuary and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, act as places of refuge for residential and endangered species.</p>

		<p>The forested hills of the Western Ghats have been drawing the attention of bird watchers, internationally. The coffee growing states of South India which produce more than 95 per cent of the finest shade grown coffee is also a bird paradise. The area also acts as a key haven for migratory birds including rare and globally threatened species.</p>
		<p><strong>Butterflies:</strong></p>

		<p>Coffee forests provide the ideal habitat for a wide variety of rare and endemic butterfly and moth species. These evergreen forests with tall canopy trees provide filtered sunlight that is beneficial to butterflies. Different species of butterflies and moths require different host species of plants for laying eggs and carrying out their respective life-cycles. Coffee</p>
		<p>forests accommodate a wide variety of herbs and shrubs which act as ideal hosts for the caterpillars to feed on.

		<p>Our observations spanning two decades has clearly brought out the fact that these delicate creatures are in fact highly specialised and each species has a range and unique flight pattern. Caterpillars belonging to different species feed on a diversity of plant species. Some species specialise on eating the mature and old leaves belonging to old Robustas, others feed on young Arabica leaves and a few others on the leaves of the multi-storied crops like arecanut, pepper, cardamom, citrus and other trees.</p>
		<p><strong>Snakes: </strong></p>

		<p>The presence of different snake species speaks volumes about the fertility status of the coffee forests. In fact, for hundreds of years, snakes have acted as powerful symbols to the village folk in balancing the energy flows inside shade-grown coffee forests.</p>
		<p>Farmers were aware of the beneficial role snakes played in the coffee ecosystem, eating rodents and smaller prey. Even though the concept of conservation is well supported by the coffee farmers, it is the modern day practices of using powerful, result-oriented chemicals that have put undue pressure on the land. Toxic chemicals have found their way into food chains.</p>
		<p>For some strange reasons, snakes have always been associated with fear in the minds of most coffee farmers. The inborn fear regarding their toxic venom plays a key role in killing most snakes, irrespective of whether they are poisonous or non-poisonous. An interesting fact is that only 150 out of 2000 species of snakes are poisonous.</p>
		<p><strong>Mushrooms: </strong></p>

		<p>The Western Ghat forests are a treasure trove of mushroom biodiversity. Our research for the past twenty years has clearly indicated that only a select few wild mushrooms have been identified and hordes of new species are yet to be discovered and classified. Mushrooms thrive under varied ecological conditions, from moist to dry.</p>
		<p>In the Indian context, approximately 350 species of mushrooms are edible. The Western Ghat to date consists of 750 species of mushrooms.</p>
