		<p>The coffee forests in particular act as migratory corridors for the movement of elephant herds from one region to the other.</p>
		<p>In recent years there has been a growing threat of human intervention resulting in the Western Ghats suffering an annual deforestation rate of 1.16 per cent despite 15 per cent of the land area being protected as wildlife sanctuaries. Due to timber logging and rampant poaching for ivory, the forest itself is in trouble. The elephant range has become more and more fragmented.</p>
		<p>Wild elephants are increasingly shifting base from the core of the forest and taking sanctuary inside shade grown eco-friendly coffee plantations because their habitat is being continuously depleted. The Indian elephant is facing increasing pressure from a variety of threats like lack of food, shelter and territory. In the final analysis, the endless search for food is the beginning of conflict.</p>

		<p><strong>Eco-friendly Coffee: </strong></p>
		<p>The fact of the matter is that mono-cropping is the exception in Indian coffee plantations. The rule is a range of simultaneously growing crops. No other plantations in the world have the range of diversity as that seen in Indian coffee plantations. Pepper vines are grown on shade trees; cardamom, arecanut, ginger, orange, citrus, vanilla and a few other spices are grown as multiple crops inside the coffee plantations. Rice and bananas are commercially grown in the valleys. Most of these crops are not only ideal food for elephants but more importantly have higher nutritive content and palatability. These multiple crops act as powerful magnets attracting herds of wild elephants into eco-friendly coffee farms. This leads to negative interactions between humans and elephants, commonly referred to as the ‘human-elephant conflict’.</p>
		<p>Primary conflict includes crop raiding, and competition between humans and elephants for vegetation. Elephants are known to spend about three-quarters of their time, day and night, selecting, picking, preparing and eating food. An adult elephant in the wild will eat in the region of 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb.) of vegetation per day depending on the habitat and the size of the elephant.</p>
		<p>The number of plant species eaten by any one elephant may vary but it is likely to be more than fifty.</p>
		<p>In fact, competition has defined the eating habits of elephants. Each herd needs its own territory to survive. Elephants are not territorial, but they inhabit a particular area if food supply there is in abundance. They also make use of the existing migratory corridors to go from one forest range to the other. Unlike most other mammals, elephant migration consists of a series of migrations in the quest for food. This migratory map is passed on by the matriarch to subsequent generations through the trials of life. Research also indicates that elephant home ranges vary from population to population and habitat to habitat. Individual home ranges vary from 15 to 3700 square km.</p>

		<p>In the early 1960s, elephant numbers were pretty stable because of the better protection and the availability of plenty of food within the confines of the evergreen forests. However, with the advent of modern technology (timber cranes, electric chain saws, bulldozers,etc.) the forest landscape has changed for the worse. A good network of roads leads to the heart of the forests making it that much easier for the poachers. All these factors have a direct impact on the sustainability of the elephant population.</p>
		<p>We have witnessed widespread conflicts between elephants and humans inside eco-friendly coffee farms. Our observations (20 years) point out to the fact that the conflict is getting out of hand resulting in the destruction of crops on one side and the death and decline of these magnificent gentle giants on the other. Something needs to be done on a war-footing to conserve these endangered elephants and alleviate the sufferings of the subsistence farmers.</p>
		<p><strong>Why The Need to Conserve?</strong></p>
		<p>Coffee forests provide key breeding landscapes for umbrella species like tigers and elephants. Umbrella species need large areas to live in. Protection of these species results in the protection of other smaller species both at the macro and micro level. Each species is indispensable for the survival of the other. This has a direct impact on the sustainability and biodiversity of the coffee mountain. The conservation of the Indian elephant also has many indirect and direct benefits. In spite of their size, elephants never overgraze and scientific evidence points out that elephant corridors are rich in biodiversity. Areas rich in biodiversity, in turn aid in the establishment of a healthier eco-system.</p>
		<p><strong>Indigenous Devices to Protect Wild Elephants:</strong></p>
		<p>Shimanta Kumar Goswami, a Nature lover from Assam has developed a simple innovative and cost-effective early warning system that not only alerts farmers about straying jumbos, but also drives them back into the forest. The early warning system uses strong, two plus nylon ropes, a few poles and an alarm bell. The rope is tied to the poles, at a height of about 6 feet and the poles are fixed to the ground at a gap of 200 meters. This network connects to an electric bell on a watch tower. As the elephant comes in contact with the nylon rope, the hair on its head gets caught between the plies of the rope and the resultant tension pulls the hair out. Instinctively, the elephant turns away and simultaneously, the alarm bells are triggered warning the villagers.</p>
		<p>The cost to cover a km with this device is around $ US 50, whereas devices using electric fencing cost approximately $ US 3000.</p>
