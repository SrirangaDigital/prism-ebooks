		<p>The coffee growing regions in India can be classified into three distinct categories based on the ecology of the regions.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Traditional areas representing the southern States of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. </li>
			<li>Non-traditional areas comprising Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in the Eastern Ghats of the country. </li>
			<li>The North-Eastern region comprising the “Seven Sister” States of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Coffee Board has developed regional logos for each region, depicting the most abundant natural flora and fauna of that region.</p>

		<p><em>The Araku valley region </em>comprising the tribal areas in the picturesque Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, is emerging as a newly developing coffee region. The Arabica coffee plantations provide a welcome green cover to otherwise barren hills. Silver Oak trees with pepper vines are a common sight in the predominantly small coffee holdings. The coffees of this region have medium to sharp acidity and intense aroma with a spicy tinge. Home to colourful parrots, it is not unusual to see a flock of chattering red and green birds, darting through trees in the scenic Araku valley.</p>

		<p><em>The Brahmaputra </em>region in the North-Eastern part of India with an elevation of 800-1200 m MSL and a rainfall of 1500-2000 mm, houses the famous Kaziranga National Park, which protects the endangered one-horned rhino. The main coffee grown consists of the Arabica milds (S-795, Cauvery).
