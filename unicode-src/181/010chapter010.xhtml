		<p><strong>Coffee Varieties -Arabica and Robusta</strong></p>
		<p>Coffee plants come in two main varieties – Arabica, which grows better in higher elevations, and Robusta, which grows mostly at lower levels.</p>
		<p>Arabica beans are mild in the cup, with comparatively less caffeine, while Robusta has more strength and is used in blends to provide body to the cup. Arabica is more aromatic and have higher market value compared to Robusta beans. Arabica requires more care and nurture, and is more suitable for large holdings.</p>
		<p>Robusta grows at lower altitudes. Robusta berries ripen a couple of months later than Arabica.</p>

		<p><strong>Speciality Coffees</strong></p>
		<p>Speciality coffees are high quality coffees that differ from normal coffee in quality. Speciality coffees are getting increasingly popular in the world coffee market and are distinguished by their origin, unique cultivation practices, special processing, etc.</p>
		<p>Consumers have come to appreciate gourmet coffees in their discerning cups. These coffees have a personality, aura, and branding of their own, fetching bigger bucks for the grower! It makes sense to grow and sell speciality coffee.</p>
		<p>India offers several varieties of speciality coffees that are popular in the West. Indian scientists have identified some of the strains that will make finer coffees with added flavour profiles, in both Arabica and Robusta varieties.</p>
		<p><strong>Monsooned Coffee:</strong></p>
		<img src="images/0052.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>‘Monsooning’ was discovered quite by accident in the 1950s when coffee beans, shipped from the ports of the Malabar coast, travelled to Europe during the monsoon and were found to have become swollen due to moisture in the air. This produced a distinct lingering mellow flavour, which has since become popular, especially in the Scandinavian countries.</p>
		<p>Even today, India offers the same golden quality Monsooned Coffee. Prepared by the unique natural elements of yesteryears and the special process of today, the Monsooned Coffee still has the monsooned flavour, mellow taste and golden look.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, the process of monsooning is carried out at curing works on the Malabar and Konkan coast bordering the Arabian Sea. For preparing monsooned coffee, only dry processed Arabica and Robusta beans are used. The best grade in monsooned coffee is Monsooned Malabar AA (Arabica). The Monsooned Malabaar Arabica and Monsooned Malabaar Robusta are the registered Geographic Indications (GIs) in India.</p>
		<p><strong>Mysore Nuggets Extra Bold:</strong></p>

		<p>Mysore Nuggets represent India’s best quality high grown Arabica washed coffee. Only Arabica beans of a uniform size from Plantation ‘A’ grade, with no defects, are selected for this premium coffee.</p>
		<p>This coffee is prepared from Arabica Plantation Coffee (washed coffee) grown in the Mysore, Coorg, Biligiris and Shevaroy regions.</p>
		<p><strong>Robusta Kaapi Royale:</strong></p>
		<img src="images/0054.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>This coffee is prepared from bold Robusta beans of the best quality, mainly sourced from Coorg, Wayanad, Chikmagalur and Travancore.</p>
		<p>The beans appear to be bold, round with pointed ends and grey to bluish grey in colour. The cup ensures full body, soft, smooth and mellow flavour.</p>
