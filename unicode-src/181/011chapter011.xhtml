		<p>When Napoleon Bonaparte famously said “I would rather suffer with coffee than be senseless”, little did he know that halfway across the globe, there would be a legion of people who had already pledged their allegiance to the same dictum. If coffee is touted as an intelligent drink, India probably vindicates this fact with its fair share of intellectuals. The rest of the world may sip a different brew, but good coffee in India is defined by the typical South Indian Filter Coffee. Hot, strong, sweet and topped with bubbly froth, <em>‘filter kaapi’ </em>as it is popularly known has been a way of life in India for centuries.</p>
		<p>Cappuccino, its fashionable counterpart triggered the coffee bar revolution in India only in the 1990s. Before the proliferation of hip up-market coffee shops like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Java City, Barista, Gloria Jeans or Café Coffee Day in Indian metros, it was the iconic India Coffee House and multitude of smaller cafés that catered to the caffeine fix of the great Indian populace, outside the comfort of home.</p>

		<p>Even today, if you walk into any bylane at the break of dawn, the unmistakable aroma of filter coffee and the mellifluous voice of M.S. Subbulakshmi’s music drifts out of hotels and homes. And once you have had an invigorating cuppa, it is tough to go back to the bilge that is sometimes passed off as coffee. Prepared from a blend of chicory and dark brown roasted coffee beans (Arabica or Robusta) procured from the hilly slopes of the Western Ghats, filter coffee holds a huge chunk of the Country’s coffee market. So what makes South Indian Coffee so distinct? More importantly, how do you prepare the perfect cup of coffee?</p>
		<p>The answer lies in what goes into a beautiful metal device called the Coffee Filter – fresh ground coffee beans mixed with a percentage of chicory, the common coffee additive that gives good body to the flavor with its dash of bitterness. The antique brass coffee filter itself is somewhat of an heirloom passed on from one generation to the next. Today, you have a whole range of designs and sizes to choose from while buying a coffee filter – from steel filters to modern swankier options. The daily ritual of making coffee is nothing short of an art that has to be honed to perfection.</p>
		<p>Basically,allfiltersservethesamepurpose– tomaketheperfectdecoction.Thetraditionalfilterisa cylindrical metal column comprising two metal cups, placed one above the other. The base of the upper chamber is perforated and rests snugly in the other “tumbler” cup, with enough room underneath to collect the brewed coffee. The upper cup has 2 detachable parts – a pierced pressing disc with a stem handle in the centre and a lid at the top.</p>
		<img src="images/0067.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Once the upper cup is loaded with fresh ground coffee (80%-90% mixed with chicory 10%-20%), the powder is gently pushed down with the stemmed disc to compress the grounds into a compact layer on the perforated section. Ideally, a medium to fine grind is used for making filter coffee. In a traditional coffee filter, approximately 2 heaped tablespoons of coffee ground can prepare a decoction that serves 6 medium sized cups. Water that has come to a boil is then poured over the stemmed disc and the upper cup is covered with the lid. The contents are left to stand. Since chicory helps to retain or hold water a little longer, it enables the water to extract and absorb more flavour from the ground coffee. This makes the South Indian brew a lot stronger than the Western version of drip-style coffee. Ideally, if the coffee brew is allowed to drip naturally, it will slowly collect in the lower container. It would take approximately 45 minutes for all the water to strain.</p>
		<p>No matter what blend of coffee you like or which equipment you use, the goal of making coffee is the same to release the coffee oils and soluble coffee compounds into the decoction for the final beverage. The optimum amount of mass to be extracted from the ground coffee is about 20% and proper brewing ensures that not too much tannin is released into the decoction. Elsewhere in the world, Drip Coffee or Filter coffee is prepared by allowing water to pass through the coffee powder by gravity alone and not under pressure of forced long-term contact with water.</p>
		<p>Usually, about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the collected potent brew is enough to stir up a good cup of coffee in a tumbler or cup of hot milk. Sugar is then added to taste. Quite often, the trick is to avoid stirring the coffee and milk. Typically, piping hot milk is poured over the brew and the sweetener is added. This mixture is then blended together by deftly pouring it back and forth between a steel tumbler called “lotaa” and a lipped bowl called “dabarah”. This swift action of pouring the brew in streams of wide arcs, has a trifold role to play – firstly, it helps to cool down the coffee, secondly, it mixes all the ingredients evenly and thirdly, it works up a rich bubbly foam head above the coffee, without any dilution; much like the action of a steam wand used to make frothing cappuccino.</p>
		<p>It was probably the skill of the person who stretched the distance between the tumbler and bowl to about a metre, while pouring the brew without spilling the contents which helped South Indian Filter Coffee earn another moniker – Metre Coffee. Another typical phrase in South India is “By-two coffee” which literally means “one coffee divided by two”. Clearly, the convenient division of drink could be attributed to the social role of coffee – where two individuals can enjoy a shared sense of bonhomie or perhaps, indicate a draining wallet.</p>
		<p>The debate whether coffee should be listed among the Top 10 Feel Good drinks of the world or lauded as a creative and cerebral stimulant or reviled as a health hazard may rage on for decades… At the end of the day, the way you prefer your coffee is a matter of personal taste. By and large, a good cup of traditional South Indian filter coffee is made using Plantation A or Peaberry coffee bean varieties, with the former being considered slightly inferior. In the old days, most South Indian households preferred jaggery or honey to white sugar.</p>
		<p>In fact, the use of granulated sugar as a sweetener began in the mid-20th century. Today, brown sugar (not the drug) and sugar-free tablets are regarded as the healthier options. However, most European coffee connoisseurs and purists do not advocate the addition of milk, cream or sweetener to their coffee.</p>
		<p>Finally, the appreciation of coffee has gone beyond the satisfying “mmmmm” or “aaaah” after the first sip. It has evolved from a personal habit in individual homes, to a social culture popularised by large chain café bars and outlets and more recently, to a global speciality coffee movement called the Third Wave Coffee. The humble brown beverage now relishes the same niche status as high brow forms of culinary appreciation like wine, tea, and chocolate. Not bad, for a little brown seed that suffered an identity crisis of being a fruit, a cherry, a berry and a bean in its lifetime. In the end, it’s just coffee.</p>
		<p><strong>The Golden Rules of Coffee Making:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>The coffee grind – The particle size of the coffee grounds can vary typically from granular to small in the following manner: coarse, medium, fine and espresso (or very fine). Over-extraction can occur if the grind size is too small and could result in the coffee being bitter and too strong. If the granules are too large, under-extraction could leave you with a weak coffee. A coarse grind can be used for a coffee pot, medium grind for a cafeteria (French Press), medium to fine for a typical filter drip machine and super fine grind for an espresso machine. </li>
			<li>Freshness and amount of coffee – Coffee beans must be stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. Long exposure to moisture or atmosphere will cause ground coffee or powder to lose its subtle flavors and aromas. Using less coffee than the recommended amount for an extended brewing time will result in an over-extracted brew. An under-extracted coffee is the consequence of using more than the recommended coffee for a shorter infusion time. </li>
			<li>Temperature of water – Pure filtered water that has just come off the boil should be used. Ideally, hot water (95-98 degrees Celsius) is used for optimum extraction of coffee. Boiling water can scald the coffee and the outcome of cool water is under-extraction. </li>
			<li>Infusion time – The duration for which the hot water remains in direct contact with the coffee grounds is a crucial factor. This is determined by the equipment used for brewing. Roughly, 10-30 seconds for espresso grind 3-6 minutes for fine grind 6-8 minutes for medium grind 8-10 minutes for coarse grind. </li>
			<li>
				Brewing method – Basically there are three different methods employed to make coffee
				<ul>
					<li>Steep and strain – This method simply involves putting hot water in contact with coffee grounds in a pot or container until under extraction has occurred. The resulting brew is strained to isolate the coffee liquor.</li>
					<li>Filter infusion – This method employs a filter basket filled with coffee grounds that has hot water added from above. The infusion time is short as the water infuses briefly with the coffee until the liquor passes through the basket into a flask or container below.</li>
					<li>Pressure infusion – The standard method where hot water is forced under high pressure though a small tablet of compacted grounds to produce a single serving of espresso.</li>
					<li>Don’t heat the coffee after mixing with decoction. If you store the decoction in a refrigerator, re-heat it separately by placing the container with coffee in boiling water. Cold coffee can also be prepared by using this decoction.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Cleanliness – Coffee contains oils that leave a tarry residue on equipment used to brew it. This can contaminate and ruin the taste of subsequent brews. Keeping all equipment washed and cleaned is crucial to preparing the perfect cup of coffee. Filters with tiny holes tend to get blocked, so make sure the holes are clear. The filter should be completely dry when you add the powder.</li>

		<p><strong>The Many Flavoured World of Coffee :</strong></p>
		<p>If you wish to go beyond South Indian Coffee and try something different, the coffee bars offer quite a choice on the menu. Here’s a sampler of the most popular coffee beverages :</p>
		<p><em>Caffe (Espresso) </em>— A small cup of very strong black coffee i.e., espresso, had at any time of the day.</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Americano</em>—American-style coffee, but stronger; though weaker than espresso and served in a large cup.</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Doppio </em>— Double espresso. </p>
		<p><em>Caffe Freddo </em>— Italian iced coffee or a cold version of a cappuccino (with a cold frothed milk topping).</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Hag </em>— Decaffeinated coffee.</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Latte </em>— Hot milk mixed with coffee and served in a glass for breakfast.</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Macchiato </em>— Espresso “stained” with a drop of steamed milk or a mini cappuccino, if you like</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Marocchino </em>— Espresso with a dash of hot milk and cocoa powder</p>
		<p><em>Caffe Mocha </em>– The American equivalent of the Italian or French Mocha Latte. Like a caffe latte, caffe mocha is typically (one third) 1/3 espresso and (two thirds) 2/3 steamed milk with a dash of chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder or chocolate syrup. Mocha can contain dark or milk chocolate. Like cappuccino, caffe mocha contains the well-known milk froth on top, although they are sometimes served with whipped cream and usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder. Marshmallows provide added flavor and decoration.</p>
		<p><em>Cappuccino </em>— Italy’s famous morning drink -an espresso infused with steamed milk and froth, ideally not drunk after lunch or dinner. <em>Granita di caffe con Panna </em>— Frozen, iced beverage (similar to a slush, but crushed ice makes it authentic) topped with whipped cream. <em>Turkish Coffee </em>– Served short like espresso, it is almost the same measure of ground coffee as an espresso, added to water and brought to a boil. Ground cardamom is added to the blend of coffee to perk the flavor. <em>Kopi luwak or Civet coffee </em>– The world’s most expensive, low-production coffee made from the beans of coffee berries found in the scat of Asian Palm Civet and other civets. The civet eats the berries for their fleshy pulp. As the berries pass through its digestive tract, proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans. The beans are finally excreted, but retain their shape. They are gathered, washed thoroughly, sun dried and light roasted before brewing. Kopi luwak beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness and is still rated as the most expensive coffee in the world! Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago, in the Philippines and East Timor.</p>
		<p><strong>Strange Brew: The Story of Irish Coffee</strong></p>
		<p>Talk about a storm in a coffee cup! Here’s an interesting nugget for those who love their tipple. It might sound like an ancient recipe, but Irish Coffee was a 20th Century invention. This unique rich brew was born on a cold winter’s eve in 1942 at an airbase in Limerick, Ireland. What started out as a panacea to calm down and warm up stranded airline passengers caught in a freezing storm, went down in history as one of the best ways to sip coffee!</p>
		<p>The story goes that a flight full of American passengers was recalled to Foynes Airbase (now Shannon International Airport) after braving heavy storms for many hours. Mercifully, the flight landed safely but the panic-stricken passengers were cold and wretched in the icy night air. Joseph Sheridan, the chef at the airbase terminal restaurant took one look at them and decided to whip up a concoction that would warm their bodies and their spirits. He brewed some hot coffee and added a splash of good Irish whiskey to it. The travellers loved it. When one of them asked whether it was Brazilian coffee, Chef Sheridan famously replied, “No, that’s Irish coffee.” Today, you can savour the original Irish Coffee drink at Joe Sheridan Café Bar in the airport, where a plaque marks his achievement.</p>
		<p><strong>Authentic Irish Coffee Recipe:</strong></p>
		<p>1 measure or shot (2 ounces) Irish whiskey<br /> 3 sugar cubes (1 &#38; 1/2 heaping teaspoons granulated sugar)<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-011-01">*</a></sup> Strong black coffee <br /> 2 teaspoons heavy or whipping cream</p>
		<p>Heat a stemmed whiskey goblet (7-ounce coffee cup or goblet may be substituted) with boiling water so that it is good and hot. Pour in 1 shot of whiskey and add the sugar cubes. Fill with strong black coffee to within 1 inch of the top; stir gently until sugar is dissolved.</p>
		<p>Top with thick, fresh cream. Pour the liquid cream over the back of a teaspoon held just above the coffee’s surface. Gradually raise the spoon as you slowly pour the cream. This will result in a layer of liquid cream that floats on top of the coffee. Drinking the coffee through the layer of cream results in the rich, authentic flavor that coffee’s drinkers originally enjoyed. Do not stir. Irish coffee is best enjoyed by sipping the coffee through the cream. Makes 1 serving.</p>
