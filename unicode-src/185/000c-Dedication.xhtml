		<p>I dedicate these fifty ‘Soul Stories’ to a Management Monk, Mr RH Khwaja – my co-author of the book ‘The Acrobatics of Change’ – a bureaucrat with entrepreneurial spirit, a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will, the semblance of ‘level 5’ leadership. Not just a plain turnaround of SCCL, but infusing the spirit of ‘Singarenians’ based on the philosophy of ‘One Family, One Vision, One Mission’ by far the most challenging contribution that he could do with ease. </p>
		<p>As I see through the eye of my soul, his present position ‘Union Tourism Secretary’, Government of India, is just the beginning of his career – greater heights await his arrival! The nation can never afford the luxury of witnessing such people ever retiring.</p>
