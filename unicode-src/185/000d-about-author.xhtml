		<p>A Management Monk parts us for the heavens above, leaving behind his footprints on the sands of time — for our guidance!</p>
		<p>I knew Janab Abid Hussain Saheb whilst in <em>primary school</em>. I met him for the first time, in a small town Kalwakurty (Tehsil), district Mehboob Nagar in Andhra Pradesh. It was the beginning of his career – he was a young, dashingly handsome, fair complexion person with a passion that was contagious. If I recall correctly, he was then the Deputy Collector, probably the year was 1950. My Father was a <em>Tehsildar</em> and he was directly reporting to Janab Abid Hussain. But he always called may father, ‘Ghani Saheb’, respectfully so, as my father was elder to him.</p>
		<p>As time elapsed, we maintained contact traditionally through letters. When I would visit New Delhi, I would call upon him and he would greet me most warmly. He always was affectionate to me. After each meeting I had the feeling that I was returning, holding the tablets of wisdom from him. I still remember that the news of his selection as Indian Ambassador to the US came to him when I was taking evening tea sitting with him on the lawns of his house in New Delhi.</p>
		<p>The first dew drop of management wisdom came to me, not from a Management Guru but from a bureaucrat — Dr. Abid Hussain. The year was 1988, in one of the seminars I was attending in Hyderabad I met Abid Saheb and Dr. V Krishnamurthy, who were both speakers at the event. During the tea break, Dr. Abid Hussain introduced me to Dr. V Krishnamurthy (who was also intimately known to me). Dr. Krishnamurthy smiled and told him, “Abid Saheb, I know him better for I even know his brother.” Dr. Abid Hussain, known for his wit, retorted, “I know him best then - for I even know his father.” Sensitizing the delicacy of the situation I hurriedly told Dr. Krishnamurthy, “Abid Saheb knows my father because my father was working under him.” Dr. Abid Hussain didn’t like my usage of the word, ‘under’, correcting me immediately, “Moid, never use this word <em>under</em> again – Ghani Saheb (my father) was working with me, and he was my colleague.”</p>
		<p>Thus I gained wisdom from one of the greatest <em>Management Monks</em>. Over 25 years have passed, and I have never used the word ‘Under’ for my colleagues.</p>
		<p>When I authored my first book ‘The Brave New Manager’ he wrote the Foreword, predicting its success. Later, this book was adjudged as the best book of the year 199596 by AIMA (All India Management Association) – his prophecy came true.</p>
		<p>He left this temporal world on 21<sup>st</sup> June 2012, leaving etched in me the memories of his noble thoughts that he shared with me whenever we met – that which I shall treasure most fondly. I pray for him – May Allah grant a place in the heaven to this noble soul (<em>Ameen</em>)!</p>
