		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he year was the early 1980s. I was working in HMT Lamps, Hyderabad, as HR Chief. This unit of HMT had incurred huge losses, to the extent of rupees 270 crore.</p>
		<p>Hyderabad is a hot place where there are only two seasons – summers and hotter summers. The hotter summer was too harsh this time. I was sweating even while sitting in the supposedly air conditioned room of my general manager, Pattabiramman. Obviously, the aircon was not on. The heat from the adjacent ‘glass furnace’ was making the room an inferno.</p>
		<p>“Are you not well, sir?” I ventured thinking it best to begin indirectly.</p>
		<p>“No – I am quite OK.”</p>
		<p>“Then… this AC, I mean aircon… I mean…!”</p>
		<p>He seemed to enjoy my fumbling, but then he replied.</p>
		<p>“Oh, yes. I have taken a vow. The air-condition will be put on only when this business unit at least break evens.” A confident smile hovered on his lips, despite the sweat drops that rolled down his face. “It is just a little sacrifice,” he said. “Unless I restrict my comforts, how can I expect my people to make sacrifices?”</p>
		<p>“You are great,” I wanted to say. But my voice was sucked up by my heightened emotions. (I know – hyperemotionality is my weakness.) I was greatly moved by his small but significant gesture of sacrifice as a leader.</p>
		<p>In the two remaining years I served there his room’s airconditioner could never be turned on. But the general manager never lost hope. He championed his people. And I enjoyed sweating with him for a pure and purposeful cause.</p>
		<p>Like a flash of lightning, the truth seized my heart:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>It is not preaching mantras in<br /> bullets on a slideshow, but making<br /> sincere gestures of sacrifice that<br /> makes a leader great. One,<br /> who doesn’t practice, can’t claim<br /> the legitimacy of preaching to others</em></p>
