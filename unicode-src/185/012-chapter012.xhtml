		<p>“Sir, run away. They are coming to beat you.”</p>
		<p>The frenzied voice of my welfare officer came to me first, much before he entered my room. A fleeting urge to run away came over but I breathed in deeply to demonstrate maturity.</p>
		<p>I knew that due to a major friction between the two rival unions, anything could have happened. One union had given the call for celebrating their victory in the fresh elections just in front of the factory gate. The rival unions had used its political sway and managed the orders for prohibition of any gathering in front of the factory premises. The Police had taken charge to deal with the law and order situation. But what I could not understand was, why the hell anybody should come to beat me for a cause not even remotely related to any management action.</p>
		<p>But IR (Industrial Relations) doesn’t see logic or reasoning. And when it comes to a crowd, even factors allied to sensibility are influenced by a crowd-mind which knows nothing other than outage.</p>
		<p>Before I could realize the danger I was getting into, my room witnessed the fury and frenzy of the crowd. The violent group of workers was shouting slogans and cursing me for quietly sitting in my room watching the <em>tamasha</em> (game), after arranging a <em>Lathi Charge</em> (caning) on the innocent workers. Frankly speaking, I didn’t have any such feedback about the <em>lathi charge</em> by the Police, though my security chap did predict some uproar amongst the rival groups themselves.</p>
		<p>My IR sensitivity to such situations gave me an inkling that there was more to the encounter than what met the eye. Behind their overt fury and anger, I could locate some latent fear and nervousness. Amidst their rage and wrath, there seemed to be a quiet invitation for my intervention.</p>
		<p>I paused using the Japanese parenthetical <em>ma’</em>, punctuating their anger with my deep silence to understand the situation before initiating any action from my side. I had perhaps understood the situation correctly. Underneath the aggressive approach, there was an yearning in their minds for my supportive intervention to tackle the situation that had just slipped away from their grip. I decided to move along with them.</p>
		<p>On reaching out I found the entire commotion happening within the factory premises. I saw a worker being dragged away while being caned harshly by the police. I found a good number of workers injured. I could see the senior executives peeping through the windows.</p>
		<p>Later I came to know that the situation had been sparked off when one of our workers had snatched the loaded gun from the policeman and rushed inside the factory for refuge. Obviously, the Police could never be tolerant to such provocation.They reacted violently. When I reached the gate, they had already taken the position to open fire.</p>
		<p>I tried to step in. The police officer in-charge did not take my intervention kindly. He threatened that he would just withdraw his force if the management felt that they were capable of handling the situation. I pursued the dialogue. When the police slowed down their action, encouraged by my supportive intervention, the workers started pelting stones on them. The situation was too ticklish – I realized that I had caught a <em>Tartar</em>. Somehow the process started unfolding itself and slowly the situation calmed down. After a storm, there was silence. We then turned to the injured workers and arranged for medical assistance. The situation gradually normalized.</p>
		<p>A little bit of demonstration of courage and patience to pause got me the credence, which I could not have earned by shying away from the situation. From then on, the union always treated me with ever more respect. I thanked the Japanese technique of <em>ma’ </em>that made me to gain time, have patience to understand the situation and to take action without haste, although there was a strong suggestive pressure from my welfare officer to run away and find some fox holes. I gained wisdom:</p>
