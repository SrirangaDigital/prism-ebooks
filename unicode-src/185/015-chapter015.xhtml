		<p><span class="bigletter">D</span>uring the late-eighties, I had an occasion to hear a towering personality in a national seminar on Productivity – Janab Abid Hussain, a bureaucrat, who later represented the country as Ambassador to the US. During the coffee break, the organizer introduced me to Abid Hussain only to learn from him that he already knew me. Obviously, the organizer was slightly embarrassed.</p>
		<p>“He knows me since my father was working under him,” I hastened to clarify my childhood relationship with him. But Mr. Abid Hussain did not take my words kindly. “Moid, never use this word <em>under</em> again – Ghani Saheb (my father) was working with me. He was my colleague.” He thus showed his humility, dignity and nobility.</p>
		<p>The first lesson of HRD against the <em>bureaucratic patriarchy</em> I learned from a bureaucrat and not from any HRD guru. A management monk who lived under the veil of bureaucracy bestowed wisdom upon me!</p>
