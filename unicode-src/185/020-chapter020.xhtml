		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he 1990s were ready to blossom. “How to meet the challenges of the nineties!” was everybody’s concern. No one seemed to be content with what was actually happening. Everyone was upset over what might happen tomorrow!</p>
		<p>As an HRDian, I was not unaware of the challenges likely to spring up with the unfolding of the nineties. I started working on HRD Systems along with my colleagues. One of my colleagues and I developed an MBO based performance appraisal system, linking the evaluation of performance with the predetermined targets set jointly by the appraisee and the appraiser. We called it PIDS – Performance Improvement and (Personal) Development System. We claimed, it was more pro-active and holistic. In fact, both of us had conducted a joint study on this subject as a research project during our stay at the International Resource Centre at UK. We were fully convinced that PIDS was perhaps the best solution to most of the mind-boggling issues of our company, HMT. We took care to integrate PIDS not only with the individual targets, personal development needs of each senior executive, but also with the career growth plans, succession plans, job rotation, counselling, golden handshake scheme and, above all, with the company’s objectives in terms of MOU signed with the Ministry of Industry. We were very confident of its success.</p>
		<p>But when we made a presentation before the Board, the unexpected resistance came from our own Chairman, Dr M R Naidu. We were caught unaware, for we were not prepared for such an internal resistance. When we tried to put forth our viewpoint more forcefully in support of the system, he reacted sharply but very politely.</p>
		<p>“Why at all should there be rules or systems for achieving the desired objectives?” he raised the fundamental objection.</p>
		<p>“System help attain the required objectives and they are capable of creating the desired climate,” was my political answer. <em>Political</em>, in the sense, I tried to press my viewpointshrewdly without giving a direct answer to his simple query. His smile spoke volumes.</p>
		<p>“How’s that the best companies of the world don’t have such performance appraisal systems? GM, GE, EDS, IBM, McKinsey, Apple… you name any. They don’t have any such system, still they perform well.”</p>
		<p>“But, sir, can we compare the work culture or management culture of our company with those which excelled as the global best? PIDS is the best system ever produced by our in-house HRD team.” I took that extra liberty, knowing well the open nature of my CEO. Sometimes, he used to provoke purposefully to get the best. Once again, a charming grin blossomed.</p>
		<p>“I am not contesting or undervaluing the PIDS as a system – I am merely questioning its utility in practice. Rules regulate and constrict the flow. What I want is something synonymous to the flow of water. Water freely and fearlessly goes deep beneath the surface of things – it flows and help flow. What I am looking for is something that would stimulate flow as smooth as the flow of water. Nevertheless, you may try PIDS as a dry-run, but keep my requirement in mind.”</p>
		<p>We were happy. We could sell our system successfully. What we couldn’t understand then was the water logic stemming from my CEO’s <em>native wit. </em></p>
		<p>Later, when I was reading Lao Tsu’s ‘Toa Te Ching’ I could understand what my Chairman meant by ‘water-like flowing process’. So long we maintain fluidity in our thoughts and approach, creativity goes on designing and forming various shapes. Fragility, flexibility, agility and softness maintain the flow — rules and procedures provide rigidity, inflexibility and hardness, which hamper and hinder more than help maintain the process.</p>
		<p>It takes time to grow in wisdom:</p>
		<p>“Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive,</p>
		<p>It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao !</p>
		<p>The world is ruled by letting things take their course,</p>
		<p>It cannot be ruled by interference.</p>
		<p>The perfect square has no corners; </p>
		<p>The greatest form has no shape! </p>
		<p>Thus, A great tailor cuts little!” (Tao Te Ching)</p>
