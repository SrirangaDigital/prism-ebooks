		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he year ’89 was the year of Nehru Centenary. The entire nation was contributing in one way or the other. I couldn’t remain a silent spectator. I wrote a poem – Shraddhanjali – highlighting the Nehruvian philosophy by bringing ‘Work is Worship’ into sharp focus. It jelled well with the management concepts. It was published in the company’s house journal. I sent it to Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India with my personal letter to him. Shraddhanjali earned much appreciation from him, “I was deeply touched by the sentiments that you have expressed,” he wrote.</p>
		<p>Like a spring, the beginning of all things is small. My director (personnel) liked the theme. He just wrote one line: Let us translate it into action. These words came out to be so powerful that it vibrated the entire hidden talents of the company. A TV film was produced exclusively by the in house talents – right from script writing, lyrics, singing to acting. A top management person came out with such a whole hearted support that his resources and goodwill, built during his association with the Censor Board, resulted in the cine celebrity, Waheeda Rehman volunteering to be the anchor person.</p>
		<p>This filmmaking was a unique. A 30-minute film gave us so much to learn – a basketful of flowers and brickbats. When everyone was ready with make-up and everything was set for an outdoor shooting, the film director fell out. Taking advantage of the situation, he tried to dictate terms to us, which were not acceptable. He gave the call to ‘pack up’. We were caught unaware by the <em>film-walas. </em>Tears swelled in my eyes. The dream was about to shatter. I heard the roaring command of the same well-wisher.</p>
		<p>“Moid, you shall direct the film,” he gave me the firm decision. Despite my evident resistance, he went on telling: “I am sure, you can do it.” I knew, he would go on repeating it until his tongue bled. He was not the kind of person who would give up. I had no option. I yielded.</p>
		<p>It was his confidence, not my competence that made me direct the film. The venture was most successful!</p>
		<p>When the entire nation was witnessing on the national network, the unique HRD venture by the amateur artistes of the company – Timekeepers to the nation – I was sinking in the nostalgia, going back to the day one of the mission. Wisdom started manifesting:</p>
