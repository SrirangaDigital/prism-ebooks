		<p><span class="bigletter">O</span>ne of my senior colleagues always narrates an incident, whenever he takes a session on Productivity Improvement Program (PIP). Once it appears, a team of Japanese consultants visited our company. They asked my colleague, <em>Was there any problem?</em> As things were going smooth and our company was doing well, he obviously replied that he had no problem. “Then, why don’t you create a problem?” was the simple suggestion from the Japanese.</p>
		<p>Later, he understood what the Japanese meant by creating a problem. A re-look over the present way of working or target setting would give new insight to <em>What more can be done. </em>This insight would enable one to set a new benchmark. Once it is done, the objective of creating a problem is achieved! The logic and the need for creating a problem appeared so simple.</p>
		<p>To a Kaizen-mind, excellence has no lid. One can always excel the excellence. Turning a Nelson’s eye to the problems is a well nigh natural behaviour. “The problem is not that we don’t have solutions – the problem is that we don’t want to see a problem!” was the genuine worry of Peter Drucker. If this is the state of affairs, the strategic move to create a new problem is much above the common understanding.</p>
		<p>Creation of a problem is the key to success, I realized. PQCD – Productivity, Quality, Cost (effectiveness) and Delivery – can be taken care of by just creating a problem. The kernel, which I could get out of my colleague’s experience, was something, which would sound wrong English. Not the grammar, but the underlying meaning that is important to allure wisdom:</p>
