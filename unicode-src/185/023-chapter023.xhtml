		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Intellectual Integrity</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>t was May ’91. I was posted as MDI Chief in HMT Bangalore. It was my first exposure to Training, which later became my passion.</p>
		<p>I was conducting the review discussion with Arvind Kumar Mishra, whom I used to fondly call ‘AK’. I found his performance outstanding. As an appraiser, I appraised him of the excellent contributions made by him during the year 1990-91.</p>
		<p>I had sponsored him to represent the company in a live SATCOM tele-conference, conducted as a joint venture with Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), linking the far flung units of six premier companies through an electronicbridge with two-way audio and one-way video channels. AK, in his mid twenties, had stolen the show from the best senior faculties of the premier companies as well as academic institutes. I expressed my appreciation for such excellent contribution during the review discussion. But the young guy was not quite satisfied. He insisted that I record some of his negative aspects and also indicate the areas where I expected improvements from him.</p>
		<p>“You ought to get better organized and learn ‘prioritizing the tasks – First thing first,” I made a casual verbal observation since he was too insistent.</p>
		<p>I gave the appraisal format to him for his signature after the review discussions. He smiled and took the format. But he didn’t simply append his signature. He first recorded my observations and then mentioned that he would try his best to improve. I never wanted to put such negative remarks on record. But he did it smilingly.</p>
		<p>Such a gesture of intellectual integrity from AK was of no surprise to me.The very first meeting with AK was unique.</p>
		<p>“I have cheated you, let me be frank and honest to you,” was his first sentence after the formal rituals of helloing. He explained that though he was not supposed to accept any other offer after his campus selection by us, he had already taken up a monetarily better assignment in a private company. But he was willing to join Corporate HMT, if I assured him of some creative assignment.</p>
		<p>I smiled and assured him. I too decided to be frank and honest. I assured him that even the best assignment with us would not be creative, though it would espouse 10% to 20% creativity. It was for him to procreate creativity in the routine assignments. To my surprise, he agreed to join us. He liked the way I put the realistic situation before him.</p>
		<p>He introduced a lot of ‘creativity’ even in the routine matters like <em>industrial relations.</em> He championed the unions by his frank and honest transactions.</p>
		<p>I recollected another shock of his honesty. He was being interviewed for promotion. The selection committee was fully convinced to promote him as a high flier. I casually asked, whether he would stay in the company if he was considered for promotion. He smiled and refused to give any such assurance. But he promised that he would stay with us for six months or so, of course without any <em>quid pro quo</em>. We decided to promote him.</p>
		<p>I came out of the nostalgic reminiscence. AK was sitting in front of me. He reminded me that he had completed the committed period after his promotion and that he would soon be leaving us. He also mentioned that his prospective employer would request me to send the copies of his performance appraisals. He had recorded the negative aspects thoughtfully and consciously so that his new employer must also know the negative side of AK. I just didn’t know how to react. Truth awakened my belief:</p>
