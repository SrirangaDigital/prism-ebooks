		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">A Moment of Truth</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he MOMENT OF TRUTH manifests when a customer comes in contact with some aspect of the organization, and makes a judgment about the quality of service that the organization provides. It is that simple gesture which leaves a momentous impression on the thoughts and in the mind of a customer, which helps the company gain the competitive edge. Why are such moments of truth only associated to marketing or sales? I don’t understand! They can happen anywhere.</p>
		<p>In 1991, during the initial stages of the development of the Management Development Institute (MDI) of HMT I had once decided to accommodate a few Management Trainees (who were assigned to us for an induction training) in the surplus portion of our Centre of HRD at the first floor as a good gesture. I knew this needed a bit of sacrifice by my people because any hostel like shelter could be a real nuisance value to the other part of the office. I therefore discussed the issue with my people and could manage a reluctant acquiescence. I then organized everything on hiring basis and made a commitment to the young guys. They were glad. But, I couldn’t keep up my words. My people were not very happy and the informal sources of an informal organization worked against the decision so strongly that I was forced to reverse the decision.</p>
		<p>A month later I visited Rashid Bhai, my elder brother at Hyderabad. I found three unfamiliar guests at the dining table. Later I enquired from my <em>Bhabi</em> (sister-in-law). “They are new engineers. They have come from Delhi for some training here,” she said.</p>
		<p>“But why should they be your guests?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“This was precisely my objection,” she said. “But your brother says that the guesthouse of the company is under renovation and due to some communication gap these guys landed here. He says, the commitment of his company is his commitment”</p>
		<p>“But it costs…!” I dragged to get more.</p>
		<p>“<em>The company has given us so much – what if we incur something for the company</em> is the argument of your brother,” was the answer from my <em>Bhabi</em>.</p>
		<p>My jaws fell. My conscience pricked my soul – why didn’t this simple thing strike me in my own analogous situation! After all, my company had provided me a much bigger accommodation than did my brother’s. To an HRD person, the management trainees, who were refused accommodation after a commitment, were internal customers. A moment of truth of that kind could have carved an indelible niche. I got perturbed with a regret of no mean measure. But gradually the sagacity started unfolding its enchantment:</p>
