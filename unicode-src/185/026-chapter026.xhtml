		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>rust and faith can get you many things in life, provided they are pure. Trust begets trust and mistrust breeds mistrust! Most of the organizations and people grow in mistrust and therefore you overwhelmingly witness mistrust everywhere. When your foundation is based on mistrust it is not quite easy to create the culture of trust. ‘Trust’ is <em>sine qua non</em> to ‘Empowerment’.</p>
		<p>Let me share one unique episode that happened to me during my HMT days. The year was 1989. When after doing my innings as HR Chief in the manufacturing units I was posted to Bangalore to manage the corporate HR, my boss – MK Jaura, general manager (HR) — advised me that I should be very careful about the corporate politics. He said that politics was played in such a subtle manner that the victim comes to know only when the carpet is already pulled off his feet. But he never wanted me to be afraid of the corporate politics and wished I should feel free to contribute in the manner I thought fit. To encourage me he told, “If you do something good and people appreciate, say it is my own initiative. And when you do something good from your understanding but it boomerangs, say I did because my boss asked me to do.” I thought he was saying so just to give me comfort and confidence. Honestly, I didn’t take his words seriously.</p>
		<p>After a few days I confronted with a situation where I had no option than to put up a very strongly-worded note to the director (finance) making the legal consequences clear, which could even result in fine and arrest of the defaulting authority. The issue was non-payment of salaries to the employees of HMT Lamps, Hyderabad. Director (finance) refused to pay money for salaries because Lamps unit was making huge losses. I had no direct access to director finance, so all my struggle for getting the cheque for Lamps unit was through my boss, MK Jaura. When I routed this strong note through him, very hesitantly he endorsed his initials cautioning me that I was inviting trouble for ‘both of us’. But he didn’t stop me demonstrating courage on paper.</p>
		<p>Next day, to my great surprise, the issue was resolved and my boss called me and gave the cheque asking me to send it to the unit HR Chief so that he could arrange payment of salary without inviting more trouble from the union. I was very happy and boasted about this incidence with some of my colleagues. Next day morning I received the call from the secretary of the director (finance) who invited me for a cup of coffee. When I was taking the first sip of my coffee, she asked, “Did your boss tell you what had happened the other day?” “No,” I told blankly. She was really surprised that my boss didn’t share with me such a big episode. On my insistence she revealed to me that the director (finance) didn’t take my note kindly and became furious over my arrogance for putting the note in such a blunt language. Then he called for my boss and told him that he wanted to see me. But my boss told him that the note was dictated by him and it was given to me for my signature so there was no fault of mine. He took all the blame and shielded me from his wrath. Later, it appears, he guardedly cautioned the director (finance) about the legal consequences. Since the steam was let off, the director finance finally instructed his department to issue the cheque, which my boss had brought and given to me without mentioning anything about the trouble he had gone through. MK Jaura, my boss, not only took all the blame but also provided full shelter when director finance wanted to see me to outrage his anger.</p>
		<p>This incident created a unique place in my heart for MK Jaura. He walked the talk. He demonstrated his words in action and won my heart by giving me a quality-support – a kind of support hardly experienced in today’s business organizations. “When the sea is calm all sailors show their craftsmanship,” says Shakespeare. The real test of rowingskills is in the turbulent waters. Likewise, anybody can be boastful of giving support to his people in normal times. The test of leadership lies in demonstrating courage for supporting the subordinate in a situation, where everything has turned against him. What MK Jaura did to me was a Moment of Magic. Though two decades have passed I still remember him and revere him. He never shared this episode with me, nor did I tell him that I knew about it. He obliged me but never cast an obligation upon me!</p>
		<p class="text-center">Demonstrate your trust<br />and support at the time<br />it is needed most can soothe<br />the heart and nourish<br />the soul. This is the secret<br />of empowerment; this is<br />the secret of leadership.<br />The Hindi phrase, “Mein Hoon Na…”<br />(I’m there… to support you)<br />is the <em>Gayatri Mantra</em> of <em><br />Empowerment</em> that plays miracles<br />at workplace!</p>
