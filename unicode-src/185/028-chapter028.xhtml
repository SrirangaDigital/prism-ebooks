		<p><span class="bigletter">B</span>y and large, I find the youngsters recruited through campus selection from professional institutes turning out fairly good. They are virtuous in concepts and their <em>fundas</em> are clear. They are worthy as racing horse – they can’t pull a Tonga. But in reality, an organization looks for both types of horses. When it comes to the brass tacks, these young guys throw up their hands. They rather avoid indulging in the routine tasks, whether it is IR, Legal or Personnel matters. I have seen a number of such brilliant guys who, while climbing hierarchy, just do not know how to cope with the day-to-day problems in office and manage their people. At such an hour of test, they either quit searching a foxhole, or get subordinated to their own subordinates. It happens nauseatingly often.</p>
		<p>I therefore decided to work on Sharad Verma, a youngster who joined us from XLRI Jamshedpur – a sharp and intelligent guy. I appreciated his contribution in creative areas and gave him a free hand. I tracked him as a faculty in the senior management programmes, against the company’s traditions at the cost of raised eyebrows of senior colleagues as well as of other participants. He performed well. I was fully convinced and satisfied with his talents. He was highly creative. He innovated training patterns and HRD systems. But he didn’t show any interest in the so-called routine-tasks, which had greater volume in HMT, a public sector company. For this reason I went on coaxing and demanding to do some dirty work (file management) as well.</p>
		<p>Once, when I found that an important file of campus recruitment did not contain even the most important sanctions and basic selection documents, I really lost my patience. I knew a few people who faced vigilance inquiries and lost their jobs on such important matters. And if the basic documents do not find a place in the relevant file, the fate of such enquiries could be of anybody’s guess. I confess – I was savagely harsh and brutally hoarse. Later I regretted the Baba-Yaga treatment that I meted out towards him. I was rather too aggressive, expecting such maturity from a youngster in dealing the file management, I realized. I felt very bad – what I did was not right.</p>
		<p>I had totally forgotten the incident until I saw a poster on the backdrop of the seat of this young monk. It was interesting and revealing:</p>
		<p><strong>Desiderata </strong></p>
		<p>Do placidly amid the noise and the haste</p> 
		<p>and remember what peace there may be in</p> 
		<p>silence. As far as possible, without</p> 
		<p>surrender, be on good terms with all</p> 
		<p>persons. Avoid ‘loud’ and ‘aggressive’</p> 
		<p>persons; they are vexations to the spirit…</p> 
		<p>I laughed at myself. The aphorism was meant for me. This creative brain knew that I was working on some sort of Management Parables. He thought of assaying me to one, to grant me wisdom. I got the kernel of the ZEN study of truth tutoring, how to hear the unheard.</p>
