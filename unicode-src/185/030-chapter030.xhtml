		<p><span class="bigletter"><em>T</em></span><em>rust</em> and <em>faith</em> are not built through words,</p>
		<p>they are built through actions – it takes time to ‘grow’ with trust. You cannot grow apples by sowing the seeds of a jackfruit. You cannot expect to build trust by mistrusting others. Let me quote a true incident. I was working in HMT – a premier public sector organisation in India. Whenever I walked through the corridor to meet the Chief of Administration, I would see a ‘steel tumbler’ chained to the water cooler. I pleaded many times with my colleague that this indicates lack of trust, which is not good for the spiritual health of the organization. He always laughed at my views saying that he had already lost six tumblers and he was in no mood to lose a seventh. My argument was that let us lose another one dozen tumblers yet not lose our heart in building up trust. This, however, was not at all acceptable to him. I confess, I failed in convincing him and the tumbler remained chained to the water-cooling machine.</p>
		<p>I was so disturbed with the sight of that ‘chained steel tumbler’ that sometimes it used to haunt me in my dreams. With all my trust in ‘Trust’ and all my faith in ‘Faith’ I could not manage to ‘unleash’ the steel tumbler.</p>
		<p>During those days, I had visited the complex of Verifone, a multi-national organization at Bangalore. My colleague manager took me to her staff canteen. As we returned, I found a big glass jar on the table near the exit. “Honesty Jar” was boldly inscribed on it. Obviously, I was keen to know from the Verifone manager all about that ‘Honesty Jar’. She explained that they did not have a system of canteen coupons. Prices were displayed and employees were supposed to put the money in the Honesty Jar as per what they have consumed. “You must be in trouble at the end of the day!” I said with a mischievous smile. “You are right,” she said agreeing with me but in the same breath she added, “But not the kind of <em>trouble</em> you are thinking of in your mind.” Then she explained that her trouble was that every day she found an excess amount and she just did not know what to do with that extra money. She then explained that since the company had demonstrated its ability in building trust, the employees were reciprocating with more sincerity and honesty. Each employee thought that if even only one employee demonstrated dishonesty, the amount in the Honesty Jar would fall short. So to overcome this, some of the employees put extra money in the jar so that the endresult would reflect ‘honouring the trust’.</p>
		<p>The above experiment gave the opposite result than that in the famous ‘Milk Pot’ anecdote: A King, in order to check the trustworthiness of his people, asked every citizen to bring a mug full of milk to be poured into a huge pot. Each citizen thought to himself, “Surely others are going to bring pure milk. So why should I not pour water into the pot? It will hardly make any difference and the King will never know”. When everyone had poured the contents of their mug into the hug pot, the King came to see the milk in the big collection pot. To his surprise he found no milk, only water! When you create an environment of mistrust, all controls fail and what you get is only mistrust.</p>
		<p>Build trust. It takes time to nurture trust. “I would rather have few thefts once in a while than condemn everyone to a system based on mistrust,” says an entrepreneur of Brazil who turned around his company SEMCO by following a simple principle – ‘Zero Tolerance to Mistrust’. His name is Ricardo Semler.</p>
		<p>Once, Ricardo received an anonymous letter against two of his executives who had placed orders for prodders worth more than $ 500,000 with the supplier. “But we had embarked on a new era of trust at SEMCO and it seemed consistent with that spirit to discount accusations that were not accompanied by solid evidence or even the accuser’s name,” writes Ricardo. Instead of investigating the actions of the executives, Ricardo decided to investigate the anonymous complainant with a clear mind. “If the allegations were false then we certainly did not want such a person working for us. If they were true, we should take the appropriate action, but we also wanted to know why such an underhand method of exposure was necessary.” Ricardo never wanted to encourage anonymous letters; these reflect a sign of lack of trust and lack of courage on the part of the sender. More surprisingly, he did not take action against the defaulting executives but took action against those who were party to the authorship of that anonymous letter. “So the two executives were exonerated and the accusers were dismissed. Only then did everyone come to know about the case,” claims Ricardo. With this action, he made it loud and clear that when he said ‘Zero tolerance for mistrust’, he meant it. One may ridicule his action but his surgery created a miracle and helped build a ‘culture of openness’ where people were encouraged to come forward and share openly their views - good or bad - about the organization but not through anonymity which is a sign of cowardice.</p>
		<p>It takes time to build the culture of Trust. Trust is not built with words. Trust is built by <em>see-able</em> actions. When you chain the tumblers to the water-cooler, you vulgarly demonstrate your ‘mistrust’. On the other hand, the ‘Honesty Jar’ of Verifone helped cultivate the culture of trust. Trust begets trust; mistrust leads to mistrust.</p>
