		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>ndustrial Relations have become synonymous with Collective Bargaining. The word ‘bargaining’ somehow stinks. It connotes haggling. To my mind, haggling can never be accepted as a management technique. As an HRD person, I have been always critical of the haggling-soaked Industrial Relations. The unions cannot be reasonable as they only resort to bargaining, was my firm belief.</p>
		<p>But my myth was broken. Recently, uncommonly concerned with the affairs of a multi-unit company, the unions decided to hold a joint meeting with the management. The initiative was taken by the unions to invite the management. I thought it was a bogy – a new strategy to sharpen their bargaining tools, by exploiting the low profile of the management. But it was only my prejudiced mind that was making me apprehensive.</p>
		<p>The meeting began. Restructuring, TQM, TCS, KAIZEN, ISO 9000, Disinvestment Plans, Joint Ventures, Economy measures and a host of such work-related issues were on their agenda. A few unions from the units tried to press their demands on incentive, welfare issues etc., but the Coordinator of the unions firmly dissuaded them not to discuss any issue which was not related to production, or productivity, quality, cost control, or delivery schedules. Management also responded very positively to most of their suggestions. The discussions were absolutely adult-to-adult, open and transparent. Unbelievably this happened in a public sector company, HMT, when it faced the bad time. And the union coordinator, who had shown uncommon wisdom, was PR Chandrasekhar.</p>
		<p>What Douglas McGregor – the author of Human Side In Industry – perceived through ‘Y’, more than four decades ago, was witnessed by us. The seemingly two different goals of management and unions, when integrated, a common objective emerged – PQCD (Productivity, Quality, Cost, Delivery).</p>
		<p>Wisdom gushed out cracking the 100-year old prejudices caused by the Webbs’ Collective Bargaining.</p>
