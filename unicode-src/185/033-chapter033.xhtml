		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Survival into Future</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span> met this technocrat almost after a decade during the mid-eighties. He was the chairman of the company where I had earlier worked. He had served on various assignments, including bureaucracy, for the last ten years. I knew that he was also the CEO of one of the Public Sector undertakings, which had a collaboration with a Japanese company.</p>
		<p>A mentor that he was to me, I looked forward to learning from him the secret of success. I asked him to show me the path of success.</p>
		<p>“Future belongs to those who can change themselves,” was the simple reply. I took this as his casual remark.</p>
		<p>Later, I had an opportunity to hear his valedictory address in an international management seminar. He concluded his talk with his whispering punch: “If you don’t change, the change will force itself on you…”. This time I couldn’t take his words that casually. The whisper was forceful and penetrating deep into my mind.</p>
		<p>Time elapsed and so did my memory.</p>
		<p>During a session in the International Resource Centre at UK, while discussing the subject, Managing Change, a faculty asked the participants to write down on a piece of paper whom they thought was the change maker in India. He then asked us to readout the names. It was amazing – all the 22 participants from India wrote only one name, V. Krishnamurhty. I just couldn’t believe. I thought I had written his name owing to my personal fancies and regards for him. But it was not all that had happened. The climax came when the British faculty had shown his slip of paper to us. We could read the same name on his slip too. Nostalgia filled inside me. My homesickness aggravated hearing the name of the management wizard of my country, who was globally recognized, and honoured.</p>
		<p>His words about managing change, which had appeared to me so casual earlier, slipped into wisdom.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Only they will survive into future,<br />who know how to change </em></p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>The world of hierarchy has come to an end. Don’t fight with it. Let it disintegrate </em></p>
