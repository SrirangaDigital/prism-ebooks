		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span>t was amazing to hear the background of a memorable film featuring the veteran Indian cine artiste, Balraj Sahani, who was delivering a valedictory speech at convocation. It was the initial stage of my professional career. For sure, the word Empowerment was not coined then. Peter Block or Tom Peters were unheard of. The film artiste narrated an incident to underscore the power of involvement:</p>
		<p><em>It was a difficult scene – the climax scene of a film where the hero watches helplessly his poor father dying of hunger on the street under a lamp post. The director – Bimal Ray – was not able to get the required emotional punch while the camera was covering my close-up. More than ten takes had gone waste. The director was disappointed and I was nervous with a strange feeling of professional remorse. </em></p>
		<p><em>At last I gave my best and the director Okayed the shot. Everyone came and hugged me for the best performance. But perhaps luck was not with us. The shot had gone waste because in the anxiety to get the best expression from the hero they had forgotten to ensure that the lamp was burning. In a dark street without the lamp on, the source of light could not be justified to the viewers. Obviously, the actual shot was taken under the heavy flashlights. Everyone was disappointed when the director finally gave the call in disgust to ‘pack up’. </em></p>
		<p><em>In this hour of disappointment, a Light-boy stood up in courage and told confidently that the shot could be salvaged.</em></p>
		<p><em>“Show an entry of a posh car, with its head lights on, zooming in. Cut the scene and again cover the car which takes a turn and zooms out,” suggested the Light-boy. We just couldn’t understand what he was trying to say. The hovering silence induced him to explain further. He clarified after a brief pause.</em></p>
		<p><em>“On the editing table the scene will be salvaged by proper sequencing. First a posh car enters. This provides the ‘light source’ to the scene. Then, the drama takes place. After the drama is over, edit the shot showing the car taking turn and zooming out. Besides providing the ‘source of light’ to the scene, the zooming car taking a turn and vanishing in the darkness uncaring for a dying old fellow, will provide richness and contrast effect.” </em></p>
		<p><em>Everyone was wonder-struck. The solution came from an ‘ordinary’ Light-boy. The director was in tears of joy – not for salvaging the scene, but for possessing such a rich human asset! The open culture cultivated by the great director, gave him the >real returns. The involvement of a light-man synergized the entire team. We decided to go for the next scene, though the dying night was at its descent.’ </em></p>
		<p>A few decades have passed. I can’t forget the message given by a monk, who was only a film actor to most of us:</p>
