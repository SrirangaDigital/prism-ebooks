		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span> cannot forget the management Monk, who gave me the key to success. Way back in mid seventies, I had the opportunity to learn from him. He was a general manager, then and assigned with a turnkey thermal project. He was known for his successful track record. I was always attracted by his sermons on risk taking. “Break the rules if they stumble the goal,” was the motif of his preaching.</p>
		<p>“Learn to take risks,” once he told me during one such management meditation session.</p>
		<p>“To what extent one should take risk?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“To the extent that it might cost one’s job,” was his spontaneous reply. He paused and said, “But he will not lose his job, I can assure you. Bona fide risks, resulting in mistakes are never punished. But even slight erring with malice is not pardonable. These are the fundamental principles of good Management.”</p>
		<p>“But what if even the bona fide risk really costs someone his job?’ I asked.</p>
		<p>“So what! One who takes risks must also be willing to pay the price. The risk-taking message is not meant for those who keep an eye on the dangling career. But those who punish the bona fide risk takers are the guys grown beyond their competence. For the sake of such ignorant corporate bureaucrats, one need not wear the security jacket and sweat unnecessarily.”</p>
		<p>I always followed his message. Many a time I have broken rules and refused to follow the beaten track. I got success. Touchwood, I never lost my job. While taking professional risks, I ask myself three questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>“Are you willing, if it costs the present assignment?”</li>
			<li>“Are you willing, if it costs you the present place of posting?”</li>
			<li>“Are you willing, if it costs you the present job?”</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If my heart signals affirm all the three times, even a shred of hesitation doesn’t touch my risk taking spirit.</p>
		<p>Almost two decades have passed. Never had I an iota of doubt the truthfulness of his message as the key to success. But somehow, I couldn’t comprehend the true wisdom.</p>
		<p>Yesterday when I was going through an ad of a Management consultancy services on the power of entrepreneurship, claiming, “We find solutions the way Alexander did”, I couldn’t help remembering the great management monk of Macedonia, while insight began winking to me.</p>
		<p>Thousands of years ago in ancient Greece, the story went that whoever united the ‘Gordian Knot’ would rule all of Asia. After many a King and Emperor had tried and failed, young Alexander stepped forward. He simply unsheathed his sword and cut the knot with a powerful stroke. The rest is history – Asia fated to him.</p>
		<p>Following the beaten track is not a sound management practice. Go on searching new tracks, not sometimes, always!</p>
