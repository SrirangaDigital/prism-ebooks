		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">The Clarion Call</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">H</span>e was a strange duck! His mind was more adult than some adults I know.</p>
		<p>Known popularly as PR (PR Chandrasekhar), he was the Coordinator representing over thirty unions of the company at the corporate level. I had a complete rapport with him – support each other to further company’s interest, was the implicit divine understanding.</p>
		<p>It was the time when our company, HMT, was bleeding. We have arrived syndrome was one of the killing factors. Since our products were being sold like hot cake, the complacency kept us in deep slumber, driving us away from the nanosecond changing trends.</p>
		<p>It seemed clear to me that the bowl of jelly was going to shake when the profits started declining. My HRD strategies – Empowerment, Benchmarking, Learning Organization, BPR… — didn’t work anymore. I was perhaps trying to pull a loaded truck with a string! Or the prioritizing of the strategies was imperfect. I was unsure, what stood in my way? A vague something!</p>
		<p>I’ll admit. I awfully get frustrated when something stands in my way. Or I get angry when what I want to do is threatened. But that’s the mood of the game!</p>
		<p>On one such uncool morning PR came to me and as usual opened his diary to discuss the various Industrial Relations problems. Stay put, I decided.</p>
		<p>“PR, I want your signature on a blank paper,” I bluntly made a wild request. I was hoping he knew that was frustration in my voice, not anger.</p>
		<p>PR flashed a grin at me, a look completely unguarded. He took the paper from my hand and put his signature.</p>
		<p>“Will you not ask, what I’m going to write on this?”</p>
		<p>“Not necessary to know,” he didn’t take his eyes off the blank A4. “I’ll deny that to anybody but you. I’m sure, it will be in the company’s best interest.” His confidence was unshaken. Didn’t he know, It’s not too smart to trust the jailer? Trust subordinates apprehensions, the second moment I realized.</p>
		<p>I asked Shashikala, my Secretary, to read out the text, which I dictated to her a short while ago. It was the replica of what I wrote just last week. She read out the main text – it was a declaration allowing the management to deduct some money from one’s salary.</p>
		<p>“The company needs blood; I sincerely share the concern and anxiety of management. I voluntarily opt for withdrawal of the increment that I earned last and allow recovery in even installments as a humble gesture to contribute my bit. Further, I surrender my ensuing increment in favour of management.’’</p>
		<p>“Great!” He stopped her short. “Didn’t I say, for sure it will be in the interest of the company! How can we ask others to give their blood if we don’t give our pint first.” Then he asked Shashikala to go ahead. She was just stunned. It must have rained in her desert!</p>
		<p>And then, we road-mapped – infuse soul into our HRD strategies was the central tenet. We needed the basic guideposts and not a project report. We needed to throw ourselves into a frenzy of emergency measures to stop the bleeding and keep the company breathing first.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>OUR CREDO </strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Stop bleeding and keep breathing </li>
			<li>First, beat our Yesterday </li>
			<li>Let each employee understand Today </li>
			<li>Then, and then alone look at Tomorrow </li>
			<li>Try to be better than oneself than to be better than others; soul searching and benchmarking </li>
			<li>Holding the company to highly demanding short term standards, simultaneously build the first and foremost long term plans and strategies </li>
			<li>Discover (not invent) the core values and the core purpose of the company – What we stand for? Why we exist? </li>
			<li>Prioritize: People. Product, Profit </li>
			<li>Preserve the core; stimulate progress; carry on...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We looked at each other. We listened to each other’s mind without the tyranny of words!</p>
		<p>It takes time to grow in wisdom, I realized. And growing in wisdom is not the management’s franchise. An anchor of light dropped! The air was saying:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Let only such people stay<br />to lead who do not believe<br />in thinking small!</em></p>
