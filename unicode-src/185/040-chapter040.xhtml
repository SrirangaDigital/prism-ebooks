		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">From ‘Brave New Manager’ to a ‘Management Monk’</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span> was fortunate to have been blessed with noble bosses all through my career, all right! I admit it that is an overstatement — there were a few exceptions. Like a bouquet is complete only after a couple of flowers are pointing in the other direction; so was these couple of bosses that were tangent to others, but still completed by bouquet of managers. In managing such ‘difficult bosses’ one doesn’t realize the immense learning being imparted by them. I agree with Norman Schwarzkopf, who observes, “You learn far more from negative leadership than from positive leadership. Because you learn ‘How not to do it’, and, therefore, you learn ‘How to do it.”</p>
		<p>When it comes to cherry-picking my best boss, the smiling face of Mr. N Ramanuja dawns on me. He was an all-rounder - A marketing person, with forte in marketing HMT<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-040-01">1</a></sup><sup>1</sup> machines. Then he was given the challenging assignment of HMT (International) for global marketing and he phenomenally outperformed. Before he was selected as Chairman and Managing Director of HMT, he was given the assignments of Director Watches, Corporate Planning. Unlike pervious CEOs, most of whom had an organic scaling, Ramanuja had an exponential career growth spanning diverse experience, making him an ideal suitor for chairmanship of a company like HMT, that had evolved from making machine tools to tractors, lamps, watches and bearings to cutting edge CNC machines.</p>
		<p>When my first book ‘The Brave New Manager’ was adjudged by IIMA as the best book of the year - 1995, he wrote a letter congratulating and motivating me to write more such books in future. And write I did!</p>
		<p>Upon breaking the news of me being selected by PESB (Public Enterprise Selection Board) as Director (HR) for BEML (Bharat Earth Movers Limited), another public sector company in Bangalore, he seemed happy and sad at the same time — Happy for my selection as a director and sad for my departure from his team.</p>
		<p>“Sir, we meet to part and we part to meet; but before I depart I would like to do something unique for HMT,” I don’t know what prompted me to make this proposition? Perhaps, it was my deep love for the company and the abundant reverence for the great man.</p>
		<p>He knew my style and rapidly retorted, gazing into my eyes, “Great! So can you help close down the HMT Lamps unit before you leave?” HMT Lamps was an ailing unit that was eroding the profitability of the company – the accumulated losses had soared to the level of over Rs. 270 crore. There were no signs of recovery. The management wanted to close down this plant, long ago if not for the far reaching legal and social consequences, and the trade union pressure made the challenge insurmountable. No labour department would give you the permission on a platter, to close down a public sector company, let alone the government giving any support. The condition had become so precarious that the unions of other profit making factories of watches and machine tools were making protests if their funds were diverted for running the loss making Lamps factory. The earlier CEOs also wished to close it down, but they did not have the required guts and courage to take initiative.</p>
		<p>“Sir, I accept the challenge!” was my firm assurance to him.</p>
		<p>Step one - I suggested, instead of a legal ‘Closer’ simply give all workers a paid holiday. Paying salaries, without running the factory, workers’ canteen, fleet of busses worked out to be cheaper! The management was convinced, but with a caveat that we find a permanent solution as this was but a short-term fix. So, we sent the workers on a paid holiday of sorts while I continued to find the solution of closing the factory amicably.</p>
		<p>Given the labour laws and political climate, in the country I knew it would be rather suicidal to close down a public sector company with a flick. Mr. Ramanjua expected that I would move from our Corporate Office in Bangalore and camp in Hyderabad, where HMT Lamps factory was located to begin the dialogue with the unions. But somehow I had gut feeling that the industrial relations situation was not favourable to open a dialogue with them on such a crucial issue. <em>When you are at the receiving-end, you must first gain the position of strength before you decide to call the shots</em>. I meticulously followed this principle for managing Industrial Relations.</p>
		<p>A month passed and Mr. Ramanuja spoke to me while on a business trip in the then Bombay. “Siddiqui Saheb, are you still in Bangalore?”</p>
		<p>“Yes,” I stated.</p>
		<p>“No plans to camp at Hyderabad?”</p>
		<p>“No, sir,” again I gave a brief answer.</p>
		<p>“It means my ‘Brave New Manager’ is now scared?” he said wittingly.</p>
		<p>“You may take that way, sir,” I said, without elaborating any justification. Behind his chuckle I sensed his thinking, that I may no longer be interested to take on such a grave risk, especially while I was waiting for my orders for posting as Director HR, in another company. </p>
		<p>As mentioned, the truth of the matter was — I was waiting for an opportune time, where I could have gained the equal position with the unions, if not greater, to sit before them face-to-face to begin the crucial dialogue. A few more days had passed.</p>
		<p>At 11 pm one night, I got a call from VS Raju, Deputy General Manager (HR), HMT Hyderabad, reporting that following some instigating speeches in support of the workers (read voters) by the local MLA and the union leaders, the workers had gone rough and damaged the buses and company property. They had also burnt the effigies of corporate directors and chairman, he added. I registered the situation differently — having committed such mistake, it was easy for me to draw the union leaders on the <em>negotiation table</em>.</p>
		<p>I thought for a while and called my Chairman apprising him of the events in HMT Lamps Hyderabad. “So what! Why are you so upset? Ask them to burn more effigies. I don’t care,” he murmured half asleep.</p>
		<p>“No sir, I didn’t call for simply conveying this news. I have disturbed you to inform that <em>the time has come to begin the dialogue! </em>Having committed such mistake of creating the law and order situation, their morale can be brought down if we take a serious action against the mischief mongers, including he union leaders.<em>” </em>He agreed and offered his full support to deal the situation fairly and firmly.</p>
		<p>I called Raju and instructed him to summon the General Manager and all HODs into the factory and wait for the instructions of Chairman. Once he confirmed that the general manager and HODs had been pulled out from their beds in the dead of the night and were all seated in the boardroom, I asked Raju to issue the mass suspension orders to all those union leaders who were involved in instigating the workers resulting in damage of company property and burning of the effigy of the CMD.</p>
		<p>Raju asked nervously, “You know, what you are asking for, sir?”</p>
		<p>“Well these are the orders of Mr. Ramanuja, Chairman and Managing Director; we simply follow them and not ponder upon them,” I commanded.</p>
		<p>Later that night I learnt that ten union leaders, who were involved in creating violence were placed under suspension. They were available there as they were on a ‘Dharna’ against the management in front of the factory. It was a courageous act of Raju, I admired him and assured him that I would be on the next flight to Hyderabad in the morning.</p>
		<p>When I landed in Hyderabad, Raju shared that the General Manager of HMT lamps and many department heads were assaulted by the union leaders. He added that they had even damaged the furniture of the GM’s office. He also informed that police had been summoned, who was currently guarding the factory. When you take action against union leaders such aggression is quite expected. I was not surprised.</p>
		<p>When I reached the factory, police escorted me to visit the places where they had smashed the office furniture and so I took some pictures for my record. I had also taken the statements of the general manager and others who were assaulted by the union. This was the tipping point that triggered me to seek permission from my chairman to declare a ‘Lock Out’, should the situation worsen. He understood the gravity and asked me to take the judicious decision as the situation demands. After lunch, I was told that the union has removed their ‘tent’ and withdrawn the <em>dharna</em> as the gossip was dissemination of the possibility of a ‘Lock Out’. By evening I got the information that all senior union leaders had moved to Delhi along with the local MLA to approach the Industrial Minister demanding my termination.</p>
		<p>The next morning I returned to Bangalore and apprised the Chairman of the situation at hand. Disappointingly, I fell sick the next day and was admitted to the company’s hospital. Having diagnosed for ‘Typhoid’ the doctors prescribed a restricted diet and complete bed rest. In evening, I received the call from Mr Ramanuja. Initially he enquired about my health, wished me an early recovery and then mentioned the new twist in the saga; The Industrial Minister had summoned him tomorrow. He hesitantly probed if I could accompany him? Without any reluctance I agreed to join him. Knowing my nature I guess he anticipated the outcome, for he was audibly pleased.</p>
		<p>The following day we were in the waiting room of the Industrial Minister. In the adjacent room we could hear our adversaries — the local MLA and my union friends. Soon we were escorted inside the chamber of the minister.</p>
		<p>“Sir, he is Moid Siddiqui, my HR Chief, and a renowned author,” Mr. Ramanuja introduced me to H.E. Sikender Bakhat, who was the Central Industrial Minister. He was unimpressed and maintained his angry expressions.</p>
		<p>“So, he is the guy, who is creating mischief against my government!” he yelled glaring at me. Both Ramanuja and I realized that our adversaries had debriefed the minister, to their advantage<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-040-02">2</a></sup> . Ramanuja tried to defend me, but the minister was unwilling to hear anything in my favour.</p>
		<p>It was time for me to speak up to salvage the day. Collecting my thoughts I interrupted, “Sir, may I say a few words?” The minister’s piercing gaze was akin to his angry looks and loud words, which was not very encouraging. But I had to carry on, “Sir, although our HMT Lamps factory is in dire straits, with accumulated losses touching Rs 270 crore, we have still not closed down the factory. Currently we have had to send the workers on a paid holiday, as the nonproducing factory would reduce our losses significantly. So we are not running the factory yet we are paying the salary to the workmen, without going for a ‘Closure’.</p>
		<p>“Is it your Pappa’s factory, that you are paying salaries without any production in the factory? How could you do so?” He bellowed yet I felt relieved. I had innocuously prompted him to say that. My CMD was calmly watching me perform, for he knew my style and had the confidence in my tackling of such thorny situations.</p>
		<p>“Sir! You are very right in questioning us, on how we could use public money to pay salaries to workers without taking any work from them. However sir, on the other hand you had mentioned that I am creating mischief against your government, when infact I’m only trying to let the workers have their livelihood and stall the steep losses for the government.” He mellowed when it dawned on him that I was killing two birds with a single shot and contrary to his information, I was actually helping save jobs for his voters. As he gaped at me perplexed, I showed him the pictures that I had shot of the mess the workers had made, days earlier. He was appalled to see the real mischief done by the team of our union friends — broken furniture, smashed glasses, blood stains, burning effigies of the senior management.</p>
		<p>Nothing more had to be explained to the minister, he realised that we were right in suspending the workers who had taken the law in their own hands. “You should have terminated them, I cannot tolerate such <em>goonda-giri</em> in my factories”, he retorted. The honourable minister had understood the game played by the local politicians and union leaders. He expressed his support for solving the issue. “What prevents you from taking some drastic actions – we cannot silently watch public funds draining out!”</p>
		<p>“Thank you, sir, for guiding us,” I quickly presented our thanks to the minister and tried to wrap our meeting, at this very note. He asked us to deal the situation firmly. Later, he called the MLA and the union guys and whacked them for giving him an erroneous picture and misguiding him. The appalling story had taken a dramatic twist, yet again – this time to our advantage! My chairman appreciated my valour.</p>
		<p>After reaching Bangalore, I was once again admitted in company’s hospital and my chairman ensured I get the best medical assistance for a quick and healthy recovery.</p>
		<p>Though we didn’t inform the union leaders about what had transpired between the minister, and us they learnt from their own sources that we already acquired the mandate to deal the situation firmly with an iron hand. So, after two weeks, I again reached Hyderabad and had meetings with all the shades of unions. I offered a lucrative VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) and also stated that those who do not want to avail the VRS benefit could opt to be transferred to other HMT factories, spread across the country. I made it clear to them that management wants to solve the issue with ‘win-win’ approach. <em>Once you demonstrate honesty and walk the talk, unions also respond positively,</em> is my experience.</p>
		<p>Without declaring a ‘Lock Out or Closure, we could solve the issue without any tears from either side. Those who got money were happy; those who opted for transfer were also happy that their ‘Naukri’ was salvaged.</p>
		<p>When I received the orders for my selection as director, HR, BEML, I left HMT with full gratification. Mr. Ramanuja arranged an informal meeting and presented me a golden pocket watch, giving me the title of ‘Management Monk’, which became my new identity. I comprehended that it is not enough to be the likeness of a Brave Manager; one has got to be a Management Monk, the resemblance of sagacity and wisdom! That was the turning point in my approach, both as a manager and an author!</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>When one lives in the company of angels,<br />he becomes an angel;<br />when one lives in the company of devils,<br />he develops the devilish tendencies.<br />I was lucky to have many angelic bosses,<br />whom I’m indebted to!</em></p>
