		<p><span class="bigletter">D</span>uring the sixth century BC, the Chinese life philosophy sprang from two pure fountainheads – Taoism and Confucianism. Lao Tzu and Kung Fu Tzu (popularly known as Confucius) brought the unexampled balance to the humankind, one preaching stillness, while the other movement! One called to people’s attention to intuition, the other gave emphasis to reasoning. One taught sagacity in tranquility, the other virtue in action — Yin and Yang!</p>
		<p>Then, there was another great soul – Chuang Tzu, born a 100 years later. He was Lao Tzu’s disciple. It was he whose famous sentence fondly quoted today: “By their stillness become Sages; by their movements, Kings.” They were the great sons of Ancient China who cultivated the Chinese Vista. On one hand Lao Tzu and Chaung Tzu emphasized ‘intuitive values’ and ‘intangibles’ and on the other, Confucius gave his sermons on logic and reasoning. Today we would say that the former used the right side of the brain and the latter, the left side.</p>
		<p>The Chinese vista of cosmic universal equilibrium is a unique blend of intuitive wisdom and practical knowledge based on logic and reasoning, which the Chinese have associated with the images of the sage and of the king. Such a balanced mix is peerless and hardly witnessed in any epoch! The Chinese sagacity is filled with both, spiritualism as well as worldly affairs.</p>
		<p>The Chinese had another added advantage – the Buddhist thoughts. Buddha was born in India, but his thoughts were accepted and adopted by Chinese wholesomely. What we call ‘Zen’ was Buddha’s philosophy of ‘Dhyana’. Further, the Fuzzy Logic was borrowed from Buddha’s philosophy of Haziness. Lotfi Zadeh, who first discovered Fuzzy Logic – the nuance between ‘Present’ and ‘Not present’ or ‘1’ and ‘0’, declared that Buddha was the first Fuzzylogist.</p>
		<p>Again, what we call ‘Digital Logic’ is the product of ‘I Ching’, which is popularly known as ‘The Book of Changes’.</p>
		<p>To my best knowledge the following five books are associated with Confucius;</p>
		<p>I. The Spring and Autumn</p>
		<p>II. The Book of Changes</p>
		<p>III. The Book of Rites</p>
		<p>IV. The Book of Songs</p>
		<p>V. Analects</p>
		<p>Yet, some believe that these books were written 500 years before Confucius was even born. Nevertheless, these books form the base of Chinese Vista.</p>
		<p>‘I Ching’ or ‘The Book of Changes’ described 64 Qua (or Kua) – differing combinations of Yin and Yang, which were explained in terms of ‘line’ and a ‘broken line’. Everything in this world, including seasonal changes was explained through these Quas. Later, these 64 Quas became the bedrock of today’s Digital Logic.</p>
		<p>As per ancient Chinese philosophy in the beginning the cosmos was an endless void called ‘Wu Chi’. From ‘Wu Chi’ arose activity, expressed as ‘Yang’ and inactivity, expressed as ‘Yin’. Yang and Yin can also be implied as masculine and feminine characteristics. ‘Yang’ and ‘Yin’ in togetherness make the ultimate reality what is known in Chinese as ‘Tai Chi’ or ‘Tai-ji’. Symbolically Yang is shown as the unbroken line and Yin as broken line ( – ; - - ) As is obvious there can only be four combinations of the unbroken and broken lines:</p>
		<p>– ; -</p>
		<p>- - ; –</p>
		<p>- - ; -</p>
		<p>– ; –</p>
		<p>There are eight Trigrams, which form 64 Quas’. The modern Digital Logic (64 bits) sprang from the ancient Quas – the Chinese Vista.</p>
		<p>So not only the binary number system but also the hexadecimal number system, on which we have built our computers hardware and software, are derivatives from ‘I Ching’. How many of us know this? Most people in China today may be oblivious to this discovery. This claim of mine may become the hypotheses for further scholarly studies by youngsters in future generations.</p>
		<p>‘Qua’ is the seed of Digital Logic. Like the Indian ‘Dhyana’ of Buddha became the Japanese ‘Zen’, the Eastern Qua of Chinese lost to Western Digital logic. While Western society is working overdrive in registering their ‘Intellectual Capital’ we Indians at micro-level, and we Asians, at macrolevel are yet to wake-up to of our age old ‘intellectual capital’ — our own heritage or Vistas.</p>
