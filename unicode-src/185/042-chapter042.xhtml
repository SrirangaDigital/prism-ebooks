		<p><span class="bigletter">V</span>ery often Ruquiya and I visit Singapore, where our son, Feroz, is settled. In the summer of 1997, during one such vacation Seema, our daughter-in-law insisted that we include Malaysia in our itinerary. We agreed and chose to travel by bus, instead of taking flight or train. The idea was to enjoy the picturesque countryside. We passed Malacca a very quite and idyllic town, where we had the most sumptuous satay and finally reached Kuala Lumpur (KL) and checked into a guesthouse.</p>
		<p>KL is the federal capital and most populous city in Malaysia. One thing very typical about KL is that it is most modern and most ancient at the same time. During this maiden visit to this city of wonderful people, I found that while some parts of the city can be compared to London others reminded me of Old Delhi.</p>
		<p>Three days passed quite fast, given that we had so much to see and explore. On the last day as we were walking though a car park to reach the main road to hail a cab to take us to our bus station, I found a wallet fallen on the ground. My son picked it up and looked around to locate the owner, but there was none. Feroz looked for a business card of the owner, but could not find one. It contained very many hundred Ringgit currency notes. After searching many compartments within the wallet he could at last locate one driving license, three credit cards and one tattered visiting card. The name on the business card was different so it was obvious; the owner was keeping someone else’s business card for reference. Fortunately, the landline number was visible on the card. Though we could find the name of the owner on the driving license and credit cards, but could not find his mobile number. We could also see his photo on these documents.</p>
		<p>We didn’t know what to do. There was not much time left for us to catch the bus to Singapore. I suggested going to police station and pass on the buck. My son was not sure if that was the best thing to do given the reputation of the local police. I looked at the watch and suggested to throw the purse at the place we located it and move along. But my son and daughter-in-law were bent upon to locate the owner. Seema, my daughter-in-law chose to take the lead. She dialed the number she found on the business card. He was a professor in one of the Management institutes of KL. He couldn’t recollect the person when Seema mentioned to him the name she found on the driving license and credit cards. Disappointedly Seema narrated the entire episode and requested for his help. He faintly recollected that there was one student with that particular name in his MBA (evening) classes. But he didn’t know his telephone number. He suggested contacting a particular college, where the professor was conducting the evening classes.</p>
		<p>With every call the matter only kept getting more knotty. With time not on our side, I knew it was cutting too fine, if we continue the efforts to locate the guy for sure we were going to miss the bus. But, both my son and daughterin-law were quite clear in their mind – <em>we shall locate the guy even if costs missing the bus</em>.Their stand was we can get another bus but this person shall not get his wallet back, if not for our assistance. </p>
		<p>Seema then called the college, where the receptionist was not very helpful. He was not willing to take the trouble to go to the class and make the announcement to locate the guy. But when Seema mentioned the name of the professor, he became energetic. He collected Seema’s mobile number and promised to come back. We could not afford any more delay. We took a cab and rushed to the bus station. The bus was all set to leave, but we still hadn’t got any call from the college.</p>
		<p>Finally Seema’s cell rang – wow! It was the call from the owner. He was very thankful to all the trouble that she took to locate him. Finally he asked where could he come to pick it? My son told Seema to ask him to rush to Puduraya bus station and look for him near the ‘H’ row. Seema also gave him some portrayal enough to spot Feroz and also the bus number emphasizing the urgency, as the bus was about to leave. He assured to be there shortly.</p>
		<p>We occupied our seats on the bus while Feroz stood near the ‘H’ row in the overcrowded bus terminal, looking for the guy. Fifteen minutes passed but there was no sign of the owner of the wallet. On our request the bus conductor agreed to delay the bus by another five minutes. The grace time was over, but the owner couldn’t be seen anywhere in the H row. We were under pressure from the passengers, who were getting restless in waiting pointlessly any further.</p>
		<p>As it happens at work – it was time to take the decision and call the shots. My son declared – “Seema, you will accompany Pappa and Mamma, while I shall stay here to return the wallet to its rightful owner. Don’t worry, I will catch the next bus to Singapore.” She agreed without hesitation. Feroz was so decisive that it would have been rather vain for me to object.</p>
		<p>Like in Bollywood films, as the bus moved, we saw a guy rushing towards the bus. Surely it was the guy we were waiting for. Upon our request the bus was stopped. I jumped from the bus and ran to inform my son that the guy was here. Perhaps, Feroz could also tell with the bus halting suddenly, that our guest had arrived, as I saw him rushing back towards the bus.</p>
		<p>Feroz quickly passed the wallet to the guy, who was gasping harder than my son and I. He probably had many words of thanks in his mouth, but given the short time his eyes did the talking. Feroz dashed into the moving bus, followed by me. The mission impossible became possible, owing to firm decision and determined mind of Feroz and Seema. Some of the co-passengers gave a clap while other a pat to Feroz.</p>
		<p>Soon after we settled down, we received the call from this person. He was extremely thankful and seemed obliged to extend a reward, which both Feroz and Seema wouldn’t accede to. Their reward was the joy that I could see on their faces. Their sweat didn’t go to waste – the wallet had gone to the right owner and that’s all that mattered. What Feroz and Seema exhibited was just one step in the right direction towards living a fulfilling life; by making a difference; by paying it forward!</p>
		<p>Later when I asked Feroz what motivated him to be so determined in achieving the success of this noble mission, he remarked, “I always put myself in other’s shoes to sense the situation at hand and then act upon what I feel would be apt to do”. Simply put, he was just following his heart. So, when was the last time you listened to your heart’s whispers?</p>
