		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he dawn of the new millennium marked a change in my corporate life. I joined a private sector company – Nagarjuna Group – as Executive Vice President, Human Potential Development. KS Raju was the Managing Director. Calling <em>human asset</em> as one of the resources was not akin to his value system. Human beings are a reservoir of infinite human potential was his belief. My two years of association with KS was a great stride in the development of the monk in me. I understood that KS acquired many of him values, especially spiritual management from his father KVK.</p>
		<p>The daily morning meeting of ‘Nav-Ratna’— the Top Nine senior management — was almost obligatory for us. Half an hour before the stipulated time we were supposed to assemble and mingle — none was allowed to discuss any official issue during these thirty minutes. So we were encouraged to discuss family, nurture ideas and share our interests, anything but work!</p>
		<p>One morning we were discussing the changing ‘business character’ where ‘business ideology’ would call shots, pushing ‘business strategies’ to the backseat. The values of the company should not change, but the business strategies can change, rather should change as per the changing pattern of business character. Whereas the former is ‘Core’, the latter is ‘Non-core’. A value-based company must continually remind itself of crucial distinction between ‘What should never change and what should be open to change.’ The core values must form a rock-solid foundation and must not drift with the changing trends. While keeping the core ideology tightly fixed, the value-based companies must display a powerful drive for progress that enables them to change and adapt without compromising their cherished core ideology. Articulating a ‘Vision’ or defining the ‘Mission’ is not enough, what is more important is seeing them in action.</p>
		<p>I began to share my thoughts, saying, “A high profile, charismatic style is clearly not required for building the ‘business ideology”. How well the organzation brings out the great energies and talents of its people with focus on its value system will determine the long-term growth and sustainable success. In a value-based company, the core values don’t need any rational or supporting justification”. After a pause I added, “Nor should the company shift its focus in response to changing marketing conditions.”</p>
		<p>The thought process continued, as KS watched calmly. He is known for being an avid listener’.</p>
		<p>Many thoughts came about but somehow I had a feeling they were blurred and hazy, lacking clarity; everyone was simply beating about the bush! KS Raju, the Chairman, Nagarjuna Group got up and wrote a simple sentence on the white board:</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>“Internal Clarity leads to External Solutions!” </em></p>
		<p>This solitary statement restored our blurred vision. What we say, ‘business ideology’ stays in your inner self; what we call, ‘business character’ is the demonstrable part, which can be seen. Your business ideology must mold your business character and not the other way around. It is so simple and vivid! </p>
		<p>We realised that making internal changes to accommodate external change is reactive, thus a well-crafted, well-managed strategic vision can help balance reactive and proactive changes.</p>
		<p>Wisdom struck to me – ‘the ancient sagacity will lead the modern corporate world’. Whom we recall as a Sage, Saint or Sufi, were yesteryears’ spiritual scientists whose wisdom holds water even to this modern day. Unlike Physicists, whose theories are respected and overturned by a ‘New’ theory, years later. This is because the Sages do not see reality externally, they see beyond the five sensory perceptions.</p>
		<p>Simply said, the Sufi and Saints knew that — to look without is to see only the outer shell; to look within is to see the real kernel. If we only look without, we are the slaves of external objects; but if we look within, we break free and become the master of those objects. So they look within; to discover what is without.</p>
