		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>oday it is amazing to see the political <em>Tamasha</em> on the idiot box against corruption in the name of Lokpal Bill. Sometimes the activists, sometimes the dismissed <em>fouji</em> and sometimes the Yogic experts appear on the TV. Everyone, right from ruling party to opposition to the anticorruption movement activists claim themselves to be the <em>Gandhiwadi</em> — the followers of Gandhian philosophy. Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy has lost the shape of its cap, as everyone is trying to wear it. While many who gather there are true nationalists, some people – paid or not – assemble with different motives as the silent majority laughs in their sleeves. Some youngster gather there for fun hoping to be caught on camera and make good their maiden appearance on the small screen, while others see it as their own version of ‘tahrir’ square revolution, that could change the face of the country. <em>Everyone is in his humour!</em> If legislation alone could bring honesty and morality; wiping out corruption, this mammoth would have been extinct long ago.</p>
		<p>I recall an incident during my NHPC days in the early 1980s. At a management-union meeting, the union was pounding the management for everything. Among others charging the management for some corrupt practices. Nirdoshi, the general secretary of AITUC union blamed saying, “It is the job of the general manager to see that corruption is eradicated from its roots.” A S Chatrat, general manager Baira Suil Project, who was known for his sharp remarks and wit, retorted, “Nirdoshi ji, don’t blame me or anyone for the prevailing corruption. Let us blame each of the Indian voter that could not elect a handful honest Parliamentarians. If we elect just 500 honest people, the country’s face would change!” How true! We elect many corrupt people and expect honesty from them.</p>
		<p>Today in India we see inspite of the lokpal ‘halla-gullah’ there continues to be a general lack of engagement between the government and civil society as repression, corruption throughout the government ranks, often spilling over into the private sector.</p>
		<p>In my view the first step we need to take is to benchmark ourselves against the rest of the world. Thankfully we do not appear on the top 20 most corrupt countries of the world (though some of our neighbours do, from time to time). It is high time that we learn from the top 5 or 10 least corrupt courtiers of the world. Let there be a think-tank formed comprising of our intelligentsia (professors, students and people from the judiciary, etc.) who can venture out to these countries and understand their success stories and learn from it.</p>
		<p>What was it that New Zealand, Singapore, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, or Denmark got it right to be listed in the top 10 least corrupt countries of the world. If we take our closest neighbour Singapore - an Asian country, as an example, we realize that it all started as a vision by a single leader who had a dream of creating a country that was rid of corruption. Certainly Lee Kuan Yew commenced by making the law tough on criminals and then ensuring enforcement of such tough laws was carried out that is more challenging an act then the stroke of a pen. This transformation called for not just courage, commitment and passion, but above all – sacrifice. In time, come rain or shine the rule of the law prevailed and voila you have Singapore – A brand that is not organic but in it lays the sweat and blood of its people that made this happen.</p>
		<p>In his book - “The Singapore Story”, Lee Kuan Yew describes how he fought corruption — He gave handsome salaries to his ministers so that they can live a good but honest life, without being lured to the dark side of the law. He made punishments harsh and fair for all. This evoked many a sacrifice — Friends turned to foe, when they were declined the favour of pardon or ‘blessing’ as we know it in India, but he didn’t deviate from the chosen path.</p>
		<p>Lee’s acid test came when his colleagueTeh Cheang Wan, an architect who was in charge of the Housing Development Board as the Minister for National Development of Singapore, was investigated for corruption by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau for accepting two bribes of $500, 000 each in 1981 and 1982. In November 1986, as the prime minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew approved an open investigation on his alleged corruption. First he denied, then later he wanted to meet Kuan Yew, but Lee replied that he would not see him until the investigations were over. Though Teh maintained his innocence, he committed suicide before being charged for the offences, on December 14, 1986. In his suicide note, addressed to the PM, Teh wrote;</p>
		<p>“I have been feeling very sad and depressed for the last two weeks. I feel responsible for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and I feel I should accept full responsibility. As an honourable oriental gentleman I feel it is only right that I should pay the highest penalty for my mistake.”</p>
		<p>So, it was not an easy task to keep the government clean. The mission demanded many such sacrifices that Lee had to make to keep his conviction alive and vibrant. There was no other way to do what he did.</p>
		<p>Today India is bankrupt in terms of honest political leaders, but just after independence we had great souls like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahdur Shastry, Maulana Azad, Ram Manohar Lohia, and several unsung honest and committed leaders.Those were the golden days!</p>
		<p>I recollect one such incident that was shared with me by the former President of India, Dr Shankerdayal Sharma about the clean government of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. I knew Sharmaji when he was a professor in Hamidia College, Bhopal from where I graduated. He was also Cabinet (MP) colleague of Mr. A Q Siddiqui, my wife’s grandfather. We last called upon Sharmaji, while he was the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. He narrated that once Pundit Nehru noticed one of his Cabinet Ministers wearing an ‘imported watch’ – The next day the minister tendered his resignation. During those days, as per the policy of the government, ‘import’ of watches was not permissible. Obviously, the minister was wearing a watch that was smuggled to India. Such was the moral high grounds just a half century ago in India.</p>
