		<p><span><sub>“</sub></span>Dear Professor</p>
		<p>…I am very happy to learn that you will also be meeting with Dr. Vivian! He is one of our most ‘unconventional’ politicians in Singapore. I have been his fan all along; although I have yet to meet him in person. Before he joined the political arena, he was one of the most prominent personalities that constantly spoke up with the aim of helping to build a better Singapore. I am sure you will have a good meeting with him. I can already see the sparks flying from the meeting of two brilliant minds!...”</p>
		<p>I read this mail again and again. I felt shy reading the last sentence, though I felt happy form within. ‘Praise’ if taken with humility always soothes the soul.</p>
		<p>It was a mail from my friend Lawrence of SQC, Singapore. This email was in response to my sharing with him about my proposed meeting with Dr. Vivian Balakrishanan, the then Minister of State for National Development and the Chairman for ‘RSC’ – Remaking Singapore Committee.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this meeting was to get some genuine understanding on the ‘Remaking of Singapore’ story, for my book, “The Soul Story of Singapore”.</p>
		<p>It was Raheed Nargund, the then Regional Director of IE Singapore who took the ‘initiative’ and happen he did — the meeting. Raheed is known for his ‘finitiative’ behaviour – once he initiates a move he never stops till he finishes it. He is a very loving person with a genuine smile. It is no wonder people admire him for what he truly is – A humble being! He knew Dr. Vivian and on his request the young minister agreed to meet me, plunging all protocol, to share his thoughts for my ‘The Soul Story of Singapore’.</p>
		<p>I reached Bukhara Restaurant along with my son Feroz, who was working with Raheed in IE Singapore. Raheed had also invited Anil Murthy, then the Senior Assistant Director, Arts and Heritage Division of MICA, who was in attendance before the arrival of the minister. I had already met Anil earlier through Raheed in one of such ‘soul-discovering meetings’. He was a very young ‘Scholar’ who had carved his career in the civil services of Singapore.</p>
		<p>The minister arrived without any fanfare — A young slim and smart person with mixed Indian and Chinese features; probably in his late thirties or early forties I guesstimated. With a bright face and small yet twinkling eyes, I found him most unassuming and informal person with zero frills. He came straight to the table and lunch was served without any formalities. The way ‘the big event’ was unfolding in such a simple manner was unconceivable to me. </p>
		<p>I was wondering, if such could ever happen in my country? — A minister driving his own car, with no escorts, no paparazzi, no yes-sayers! In fact in India, used to be a fashion statement for anyone with a political attire to flaunt bodyguards but now it’s becoming a fetish rather than a security prerequisite. One of my mis-encounters with a politician was when during a flight from Delhi to Bangalore; I found my co-passenger a familiar face. He must be some popular figure as the airhostess of Indian Airlines, were serving him with pasted smiles and bent knees. Then, the co-pilot swung by and started ‘siring’ him. I recalled having seen him on TV before but somehow could not place him. I didn’t like the frustrating feeling of not recalling who he was, but my curiosity got the better of me and I had to ask him.</p>
		<p>He looked at me sheepishly and replied, that he was the Minister for Civil Aviation, Sharad Yadav. He was certainly not pleased with my lack of knowledge about his political stardom. Little did he know that this was only the establishment of my party-political ignorance? A few probing questions later about his political party gave way to my farreaching obliviousness, as he realised that I had mistaken him for his namesake — Sharad Mahajan a politician from a rival political party.</p>
		<p>Back in Singapore, no ‘wasta’ was required to meet a vibrant personality like ‘Dr. Vivian’. After the pleasantries he began sharing his views. His tone was so polite that occasionally I had to bend forward to lend him an ear; my ears that were attuned to the high pitch of blaring horns I hear, back home were recalibrating to the humble low pitch of the minister. He would make conscious effort to look at each of us sparingly, showing both importance and comfort. Let me try to restate his infinite passion through my finite vocabulary.</p>
		<p>“Singapore had an accidental birth!” He took us back to the year 1819 and narrated the history of Singapore’s accidental discovery by Sir Stamford Raffles. It was a small deserted island without any resources. Like India, Singapore went through the British Raj for over 150 years. It also faced the darkest time during the Japanese occupation. Eventually liberation came for Singapore and Malaya, but the federal honeymoon didn’t last long. When Singapore was cast out by Malaya and became prematurely independent in 1965, the leaders cried rather than cheered. The idea that a small island city-state of two million people with no congenial neighbourhood could survive in what was then a difficult and troubled region seemed almost unreal. The odds were always against Singapore succeeding. Remarkably, it has survived beating the odds and grown up well. </p>
		<p>Vivian was very modest not claiming Singapore as one of the most advanced nations of the world. Contrarily, he said, “Four decades’ time is too short for gaining maturity for any nation, especially in a multi-lingual, multi-racial, and multi-religious society.” After a brief pause he added, “But I am very optimistic.”</p>
		<p>He didn’t make any tall claims, nor did he underestimate the severity of the challenge before Singapore. But he was quite firm and optimistic to grow as a great nation. And grow it did, today we all recall Singapore Inc., with awe!</p>
		<p>“We can neither undo our history, nor can we change our geography! It is a fact that Singapore is a very small piece of land”, he noted.</p>
		<p>Singapore is one of the smallest and densely populated countries in the world. Nonetheless if you compare Singapore as a ‘city’ with other populous cities in the world, the picture suddenly emerges — advantage Singapore! Singapore is indeed a city-state. </p>
		<p>“Though we couldn’t make the small island big, we have discovered the ways to create value beyond geography,” he said with a mild smile. Then he explained the FTA – Free Trade Agreement – policy of Singapore. Later, I learnt that within a brief time Singapore has already concluded FTAs with New Zealand, European Free Trade Association, Japan, Australia and United States and made good progress with other countries, to name a few, China, India, Canada, Jordon, Korea, Mexico, Sri Lanka, besides the ASEAN countries.</p>
		<p>“China, India and the US would make good progress and may probably lead the world economy for the next fifty years.” I gathered this from the views of Dr. Vivian. “These three countries make a good economic triangle,” added Anil. Both, Raheed and Anil were quite eloquent during the informal meeting with the minister.</p>
		<p>“Yes, an economic triangle,” Vivian smiled and added, “Singapore could become the centre of this economic triangle.” Then he explained how Singapore was going to emerge as an economic hub in the Southeast Asia linking the East and the West.</p>
		<p>“Creating a compassionate and gracious Singapore seems to be the sole objective of Remaking Singapore,” I purposely refocused the topic. “For my soul story of Singapore, I would like to know more about it.” After saying this I sought his permission to quote extracts from his report that he submitted to government as the Chairman of Remaking Singapore Committee. He smilingly permitted, granting a great relief to me. </p>
		<p>I knew that the government’s endeavour is to rebuild Singapore by strengthening the value system through a ‘Beyond 5 Cs’ (Career; Credit Cards; Cars; Condos; Clubs) campaign. ‘The Remaking Singapore Committee’ has reached out to a wide cross-section of Singaporeans, especially the post-independent generation, to understand their aspirations and goals, as well as to explore new ideas, directions and plans. With the survival impetus clearly in mind, the Committee has arrived at ‘actionable outcomes’ – the outcomes that arise from a diversity of views offered by Singaporeans, for the benefit of Singaporeans. </p>
		<p>Concluding, Dr. Vivian elucidated how they plan to remake Singapore enriching the values and keeping focus on intangibles alongside economical and technological developments.</p>
		<p>I thought to myself, “Do countries like India envisage such value-based economy?” Instead, as we learn from the media that our legislators while away their time by watching illicit films on their mobile phones and iPads, during important deliberations that could potentially change the nation.</p>
		<p>My meeting with the minister is but a fond memory — the moments remained frozen in space, though the time was moving. “What a dragon!” I murmured. As the legend goes, only once Confucius had gone to meet Lao Tzu at his monastery and came back possessed with his intuitive thoughts so much so that he called Lao Tzu a dragon that could climb the clouds. It was the central intelligence that released a bit from its reservoir and the world of knowledge was filled with noble thoughts on virtue and wisdom.</p>
