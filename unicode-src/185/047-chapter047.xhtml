		<p><span class="bigletter">N</span>o company has ever born cash rich unless either the founder has pumped in borrowed money or inherited a fortune. I floated my consulting company, ‘Intellects Biz’ in the year 2004. After having conducted six workshops I was still toiling with the teething problems of its infancy, which was a natural phenomenon. Those were the days when ‘Intellects Biz’ had little identity so much so that many a time I used to feel shy in introducing myself as the managing director of a company unknown to Corporate India. The only point that kept my morale high was feedback from the participants. Many of my training workshops used to conclude with delegates giving a ‘Standing Ovation’ in recognition of my efforts and unique methodology.</p>
		<p>One company that had been participating diligently in most of my workshops was BASIX – a value-based company dealing with micro financing. One day I received a call from Vijay Mahajan, the Chairman and Managing Director of BASIX. He wanted to meet me. He proposed that either he would come to my office or I go to his office to meet him. On two occasions that we agreed to meet the meeting didn’t take place. The third time, I could make it. Since he didn’t mention the purpose of meeting, I was expecting a business meeting for some consultancy assignment.</p>
		<p>When I reached BAXIS’s corporate office, the receptionist welcomed me, by leaving her chair and ushered me to the Chairman’s chamber, making me feel, like an important visitor.</p>
		<p>I entered the room and Vijay Mahajan welcomed me by getting up from his chair – a good gesture. Then something strange happened. He started looking at me, from top to toe, and in second glance, from toe to top! I felt a bit embarrassed. I asked him what made him to look at me that way. He coolly told me, “Let me see you, Professor Siddiqui, wholesomely!” After a while he offered the chair and requested me to be comfortable. Then he asked my choice, which, as usual, went in favour of coffee.</p>
		<p>While sipping my coffee I asked him what made him to look at me that way. And his reply was most inspiring to me. He said, “In each of your workshops I have sponsored a batch of six managers. After they come back from your workshop I met each of them. Do you know what happened?” I didn’t know so I just smiled. “When they come to me from your workshop, they forget to walk – they only fly.” He paused and looked at me. I didn’t know whether it was a contempt or compliment! After a long pause he said, “When this happened to my sixth batch of managers, I decided to meet the guru who has the magic power to inspire my people to the extent that they fly up, up and away and never look down, or look back.” It was an emotional punch — my eyes swelled with tears, as I was not mentally prepared to receive such a great compliment from a great man, who received many national awards and recognitions.</p>
		<p>“The core purpose of this meeting was,” coolly mentioned Vijay Mahajan, “to meet the person, who is capable to play miracles.” The meeting was over with some informal chat. To me, it was a great <em>moment of truth</em>!</p>
		<p>Now that my company has grown and became eight years old, there is not a single workshop in which the delegates from BASIX have not participated. Once there was a calendar clash and the VP-HR had to cancel the nominations as the quarterly business review meeting was scheduled on the same dates. But, when Vijay Mahajan came to know about it, he asked his HR chief not to cancel the nominations and, rather, change the dates of the business review meeting. It was a unique experience and another great <em>moment of truth for us at Intellects Biz</em>.</p>
		<p>I have yet to see a Pied Piper like Vijay Mahajan who always creates Moments of Magic for others. He loves his people and people love him.</p>
