		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Incredible Credibility</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">W</span>e use the words ‘Trust’ and ‘Credibility’ as two sides of a coin that always go along together. While at times trust brings credibility there are occasions when credibility results in trust. Though they are both offspring of ‘faith yet, there is a stark difference between ‘Trust’ and ‘Credibility’. </p>
		<p>‘Trust begets trust’ – the keyword here being begotten — from YOU! As you have direct control on Trust – you can give trust and likely have it in return. While you could choose to trust someone, or not, you really don’t have any direct say on your own credibility – others do. You may make efforts to earn trust but it doesn’t warrant credibility. That seal of credibility remains in others’ hands. So simply said — it is merely though continuous trust that you can foster (not enforce) credibility.</p>
		<p>The India Tourism Development Corporation Limited (ITDC) is a Hospitality, retail and Education company owned by Government of India, under the Ministry of Tourism. Established in 1966, it owns over 17 properties under the brand —Ashok Group of Hotels, across India. When Dr Lalit K Panwar (IAS), the Chairman and Managing Director of ITDC invited me to conduct a workshop in Hotel Ashok, New Delhi on the theme, “Moments of Truth” (MoT), I though to myself how I could show light to the very beacon in the hospitality industry. However, seeing the team of directors and senior managers in my audience boosted my morale. By the end of my three-day mentoring session it dawned on me that Dr Panwar had been present all through the sessions – an uncommon feat of protocol feigning chairmen and MDs of corporate India.</p>
		<p>Well, I finished the session to a resounding applause and my moment of truth emanated from the delightful feedback the participants showered on me. The best of which came from Dr Panwar, who rivaled the performance of this MoT workshop with ‘Sholay’, the Bollywood blockbuster film of the 1970s. Besides that his pleasing remark fleetingly lent me a feeling like I was ‘Vijay’ the hero (Amitabh Bachan), this unique compliment warmed my heart.</p>
		<p>Later, Dr Panwar shared that guests, especially foreigners, give good feedback about the <em>genuine</em> smile of staff at hotel Ashok. Agreeing, I added that Dalai Lama’s concept of ‘genuine smile’, emanates only when there is some basis to smile. Dr Panwar nodded and said he explains to the foreigners that even though India is a country of various religions we all believe in the Indian tradition where guests are considered as the blessings of God!” I smiled to myself thinking that His Holiness would be thrilled to hear the basis of the smiles at Hotel Ashok.</p>
		<p>When you build a green pasture in your heart, the lovebirds recurrently visit. No wonder a government owned hotel managed by ITDC, under the leadership of Dr Lalit K Panwar – a very humble and charming person – earned its credibility in the hospitality industry for they look within, sans aping the West. They take the <em>kernel</em> – the spirit — from the inherited Indian values, without the shallow and superficial show-off!</p>
		<p>Motivated with the feedback of my performance I was requested to replicate the philosophy of Moments of Truth to all the general managers of Ashok group. The repeat workshop was held in hotel Jaipur Ashok, the following month. Dr Lalitkumar Panwar once again participated and remained seated along with his team – the <em>creme de la creme </em>of the Indian hospitality industry. Yet again I was faced with -Teach fish how to swim - dilemma. Alhamdulillah! The workshop went well with excellent feedback from the participants.</p>
		<p>On the following day I used my spare time to go for some sightseeing and shopping, before catching my late evening flight back home. One of the managers at hotel Ashok proudly volunteered to show me around Jaipur. In one of the handicraft emporiums after I had made my selection, my guide tried to bargain for me and was rewarded with a 10% discount by the shop owner. As we were walking out, my guide sparingly mentioned to the owner that I was the special guest of Dr Lalitkumar Panwar. </p>
		<p>What followed was most amazing! To my great surprise, the owner left his chair and greeted me with greater warmth. He queried my guide, “Why didn’t you mention this to me earlier? The guest of Panwar Saheb is the guest of honour for me”. Mystified I probed further only to learn that Dr Panwar had done so much for Jaipur as a noble administrator that none could ever forget him. Actually, Dr Panwar had served Rajasthan in many capacities, including Principal Secretary and Secretary Tourism, and made such a wonderful contribution that the people of Rajasthan were indebted to him. No wonder that even a common shopkeeper had so much reverence for him.</p>
		<p>The climax came when the owner of the emporium took the bill from my hands and tore it, as he asked the cashier to prepare another bill offering me 30% discount instead. I was humbled and accepted the discount but not before I pondered upon the credibility of the noble soul! — Just by being his <em>Atithi</em> I had derived so much reverence from a stranger – What an incredible credibility of Dr Panwar indeed!</p>
