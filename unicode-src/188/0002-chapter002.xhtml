		<p><strong>Buy '1' get '3' free!</strong></p>
		<p>All of us are aware of the marketing gimmicks followed by several companies with the offer of “Buy '1' Get '1' free!”. Everybody will readily agree that the best offer is to “Buy none, get one free!!!”, but unfortunately this is not possible. A fantastic offer would be -“Buy '1' Get '3' free!” In this offer, buy '1' refers to attaining excellence through perseverance and hard work supported by a systematic approach while get '3' free refers to Success, Wealth and Fame which come along with excellence at free of cost.</p>

		<p>Attaining success, wealth and fame is the natural desire of most human beings. But very few can understand that these are the by-products that come naturally in the process of making the main product called 'Excellence'.</p>
		<p><strong>What is personal excellence and how is it achieved?</strong></p>
		<p>'Excellence' is often defined as the quality of being excellent; the state of possessing good qualities of an eminent degree; exalted merit and superiority in virtue. It can be summarized as the character of a man. Similar to the characteristics of a person, every organization has its own D.N.A. which represent the overall quality of individuals that make up the organization. Here is how we can all achieve excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>The Step by Step process of attaining excellence!</strong></p>
		<p>We have to attain excellence (character) to change our destiny. But we cannot directly attain excellence and there is no shortcut for this long journey. First we need to change our thoughts as it is the thoughts that drive our actions. When we repeat these actions prompted by ideal thoughts, they become our habits. When we repeat these habits they become a part of our character which represents our qualities of excellence. Hence, the journey to excellence is 'Change thoughts to ideal thoughts, make these ideal thoughts dominant by constantly thinking of them and dreaming of them - then implement actions to synchronize with the new ideal thoughts- establish habits through repeated actions - then attain character (excellence) through repeated habits'. To understand this further, let us turn our attention to a story aptly explained by Swami Vivekananda while giving lectures on Raja Yoga in America:</p>
		<p class="text-center">Be a man first, my friend, and you will see how all those things (money, name, fame) and the rest will follow of themselves after you.</p>

		<p>If there is no passion in your life, then have you really lived? Find your passion, whatever it may be. Become it, and let it become you and you will find great things happen FOR you, TO you and BECAUSE of you.</p>

		<p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.</p>

		<p>“There was once a minister to a great king. He fell into disgrace. The king, as a punishment, ordered him to be shut up in the top of a very high tower. This was done, and the minister was left there to perish. He had a faithful wife, however, who came to the tower at night and called to her husband at the top to know what she could do to help him. He told her to return to the tower the following night and bring with her a long rope, some stout twine, pack thread, silken thread, a beetle, and a little honey. Wondering much, the good wife obeyed her husband, and brought him the desired articles. The husband directed her to attach the silken thread firmly to the beetle, then to smear its horns with a drop of honey, and to set it free on the wall of the tower, with its head pointing upwards. She obeyed all these instructions, and the beetle started on its long journey. Smelling the honey ahead it slowly crept onwards, in the hope of reaching the honey, until at last it reached to top of the tower, when the minister grasped the beetle, and got possession of the silken thread. He told his wife to tie the other end to the pack thread, and after he had drawn up the pack thread, he repeated the process with the stout twine, and lastly with the rope. Then the rest was easy. The minister descended from the tower by means of the rope, and made his escape.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/040.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>In the above example, the silk thread represents our thought, pack thread represents our constant thinking and dreaming of the thought which make it dominant and strong; the stout twine represent our actions; and the long rope represent our habits and qualities of excellence formed by repeated actions. We can see from the story that it is only the rope that saved the life of the minister, but the journey began with silk thread thereby facilitating grip on other higher and higher things.</p>
		<p>Work, work the idea, the plan, my boys, my brave, noble, good souls --to the wheel, to the wheel put your shoulders! Stop not to look back for name, or fame, or any such nonsense.</p>

		<p><strong>Failures through short cut methods</strong></p>
		<p>Nobody wants to pass through a Hell full of struggles and hard work to attain excellence. Each of us directly wants the Heaven of 'Success, Wealth &#38; Fame'. A vast majority of people attempt to use shortcut methods and manipulations to attain success, wealth and fame directly without undergoing the pain of attaining excellence (character). Though, in certain cases, there may be successes by manipulation and tricks, these will not last long . It is like attempting to produce the by-products without manufacturing the main product. But if we attain the main product whose name is 'Excellence' , then its' by-products, viz. Success, Wealth, Name and Fame, Health etc., will automatically come to us.</p>

		<p><strong>If there is any road to Heaven, it is through Hell : Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “The real desire for the ideal. Everything comes easy after that... The struggle is the great lesson. Mind you, the great benefit in this life is struggle. It is through that we pass. If there is any road to Heaven, it is through Hell. Through Hell to Heaven is always the way. When the soul has wrestled with circumstance and has met death, a thousand times death on the way, but nothing daunted has struggled forward again and again and yet again -- then the soul comes out as a giant and laughs at the ideal he has been struggling for, because he finds how much greater is he than the ideal.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		<p><strong>Starting from the root of the problem!</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “Once lay hold of one link of the chain and the whole must come after it by degrees. Water the root of the tree and the whole tree is watered. It is of little advantage to waste time to water each leaf.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/044.jpg" alt="images" />

		<p>We need to start with changing our thoughts to change our lives. Hence our thought is the control button to change our action. All of us use a T.V. remote control to change channels and the moment we change the channel, a new serial will run on the same T.V. screen. Similarly, when we alter our thoughts, the programmes in our life will also change.</p>
		<p>We have to learn the rules of the life-game and master the art of playing it well. It is not just learning about the techniques of manifesting the powers of the mind but also how to act upon them!</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda summarizes the nitty - gritty of attaining excellence</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “ Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life -- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.” In the above message of Swami Vivekananda, the entire process of achieving excellence is packed firmly. Start with the thought (idea) and changing that thought changes our lives. Make those thoughts the dominant force by constantly dreaming of them. Then live up to the idea by acting upon it. Let the brain, muscles, nerves and every part of your body mould your character centering on the idea.</p>
		<p>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life –-- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</p>

		<p><strong>Understand the secrets of great men and apply them to your needs</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “ The history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves… We have had such men at all periods of the world's history and at all times…. Suppose we can investigate these laws and understand their secrets and apply them to our own needs; it follows that we grow.”</p>
		<p>What is the greatness behind the great people across the World? Success is not a secret; its greatness lies in principles followed in attaining it and these principles are universal and not personal. It comes to whosoever follows certain principles/processes. The success, wealth or fame acquired by them is because of their adherence to certain processes of excellence. Leave aside their glory, fame and wealth, and only follow the processes followed by them. Emulate those processes of excellence unhesitatingly and execute them meticulously. If you read their success stories, the process behind the success will be very clear to you as one cannot create a success story without enumerating the processes that were followed. All successful people start with changing their thoughts to change their lives. They dream about these thoughts - day in and day out - so that these become the dominant thoughts of their minds. Then they incessantly put these into action. These actions create systematic habits in them which will shape their character (qualities of excellence). The process is the same in the lives of all great persons. Success, wealth and fame come to them as a corollary to their attainment of excellence in their chosen ideas. Whether they want it or not, the success, wealth and fame follows these people of excellence like the faithful dog! None of the great persons ever struggled for fame and wealth. These came to them free of cost along with excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Look at the universal process behind great people</strong></p>
		<p>Look at the success stories of Bill Gates, Henry Ford, Dr Narayana Murthy, Ratan Tata, Abdul Kalam, M S Subbulakshmi, Sachin Tendulkar, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison and Abraham Lincoln. The process behind them is the same and as rightly presented by Swami Vivekananda, “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life -- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”</p>
		<p><strong>Character follows the person from birth to birth</strong></p>
		<p>All of us understand long-term investments like purchasing housing plots and flats in posh areas of a city, and purchasing blue chip company shares. Also the money invested in getting educated is a right example of long-term investment. But there is a wonderful long-term investment that many do not know. This wonderful investment grows and multiplies not only in the present birth of an individual but also in his subsequent births. This investment is nothing but our character and it is always carried over from one birth to the next birth. Hence, all the struggles and hardships (investments) we undertake in building our individual character is not only a blessing in our present birth but will also follow us in our next birth.</p>
		<p>According to Hindu scriptures, there are three different bodies in every human being, i.e. physical body, subtle body and causal body. Animals give food only to the physical body. However, a human being must give food for all the three bodies. The food for the physical body is what we eat every day. Intellectual pursuits, philosophy, science, engineering, technology, commerce, management and other such objective matters are the food for</p>

		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/049.jpg" alt="images" />
			<figcaption>Causal Body</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Our inner values and traits which form our character are the food for our causal body. The food we give to our physical body helps us to work for a short time and is to be replenished every day. The food we give to the subtle body, i.e. our education, professional knowledge and even the spiritual knowledge acquired by reading books will remain with us for one life-span and gets lost completely at the time of the next birth. When a person dies, his physical body is burnt in the burial ground and that is the end of the physical body. What lives on after the cremation is the subtle body. The person remains with his/her subtle body (<em>preta shareer</em>) for some time but when he/she takes a new birth in a mother's womb, this current subtle body is discarded and the person gets a new subtle body along with the new infant body. If a person is a doctor or a chartered accountant in the current birth, that professional knowledge does not get transferred to the next birth as the person's subtle body, which holds that knowledge, is lost at the time of taking root in a new physical body. But the contents of the causal body remain within the soul for every new birth till it gets liberation. The essence of our character that represents our inner values - qualities of excellence and traits - gets stored in the causal body. When a person takes a new birth, he gets a new physical body and a new subtle body, but his causal body remains the same which is transferred from birth to birth. In Sanskrit, a person's character is termed as <em>'samskaras'</em> or <em>'vasanas'</em> (individual traits). They are carried over from one birth to the next through the causal body.</p>
		<p><strong>All children of a given parent do not have the same character</strong></p>
		<p>Very often we find wide variations in the characters of children in a given family. Though born to the same parents, brought up in the same environment, studying at the same school and being taught by the same teachers, we see a wide variation in the character of children in every family. While one may have criminal tendencies, the other may possess noble tendencies; while one cheats everybody, the other one helps everybody. Why this vast difference in the children of the same family? Character is not inherited from parents but is brought forward from one's previous birth to the present through casual body and this can be further improved by persistent efforts in the present birth.</p>

		<p><strong>Persistent work, through ages and ages: Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<p>Addressing public lectures on Karma Yoga in western countries, Swami Vivekananda said, ' The men of mighty will the world has produced have all been tremendous workers --gigantic souls, with wills powerful enough to overturn worlds, wills they got by persistent work, through ages, and ages. Such a gigantic will as that of a Buddha or a Jesus could not be obtained in one life, for we know who their fathers were. It is not known that their fathers ever spoke a word for the good of mankind. Millions and millions of carpenters like Joseph had gone; millions are still living. Millions and millions of petty kings like Buddha's father had been in the world. If it was only a case of hereditary transmission, how do you account for this petty prince, who was not, perhaps, obeyed by his own servants, producing this son, whom half a world worships? How do you explain the gulf between the carpenter and his son, whom millions of human beings worship as God? It cannot be solved by the theory of heredity. The gigantic will which Buddha and Jesus threw over the world, whence did it come? Whence came this accumulation of power? It must have been there through ages and ages, continually growing bigger and bigger, until it burst on society in a Buddha or a Jesus, even rolling down to the present day.'</p>

		<p><strong>Carrot Vs Vitamin A capsules</strong></p>
		<p>Let us now take another example to understand how the success and glory brought in by qualities of excellence are far more powerful than those acquired by some shortcut methods. All of us know that the carrot, a vegetable, is very rich in Vitamin A. We can also get Vitamin A quickly by taking Vitamin A capsules. But Vitamin A capsules are to be taken in limited doses as per the advice of the doctor. If one consumes a complete bottle of Vitamin A capsules in one dose, one will have to be admitted in the hospital for consuming an overdose of this vitamin. However, if one eats one Kg of carrots - which may give us Vitamin A in a much higher dose -there is no health risk at all and one, in fact, becomes more healthy. The fact is that the carrot produces many enzymes along with Vitamin A, while Vitamin A capsule does not contain the other rich enzymes of the carrot. In a similar way, if one is trying to obtain wealth and fame through shortcut methods without passing through the long journey of attaining excellence, one is exposed to dangers. Grabbing a little fame/wealth through gimmicks and tricks may work in a limited way. But long-term glory, name, fame and everlasting success cannot be achieved by such tricks. Perpetual success, glory, wealth, name and fame can only be achieved through the long journey of excellence.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/060.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>All of us are aware of 'World Class Companies'. These companies/organizations have qualities of excellence. Profits are the by-products that come naturally to these companies in their journey of excellence. They focus on quality of goods/services, employee's welfare, supplier's sustainability, customer's needs, shareholder's rewards and the welfare of needy people through Corporate Social Responsibility activities. The products/services of such admirable companies are always preferred by customers. Profits come to them only after taking care of the other factors stated above. But the wonder is that such World Class Companies have huge profits and the secret behind their success is their focus on excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Lord Indra learns secrets from Prahlada</strong></p>
		<p>Lord Indra is the King of Gods or Devas and is the Lord of Heaven. He is also the God of war, storms and rains. He is one of the chief deities in the Rigveda besides being the ruler of a direction (<em>'Dikpalaka'</em>). However, his reputation suffered severe set-backs many times due to his indulging in carnal pleasures by inflicting many kinds of mischief to exploit others and he was punished for these transgressions.</p>
		<p>Prahlada was born in the family of Rakshasas (demons) but was a great devotee of Lord Narayana. He is famed for his exclusive devotion to Lord Vishnu and often quoted as a role model for devotees of God. Due to his qualities of excellence, Prahlada became King of the three worlds.</p>
		<p>Lord Indra wanted name, fame and success like Prahlada. He approached <em>Rishi Brihaspati</em> and requested his guidance in this matter. Brihaspati directed Lord Indra to approach Parasurama (Bhargava Rama). Accordingly, Lord Indra approached Bhargava Rama, who in turn advised him to directly approach Prahlada. Lord Indra approached Prahlada disguised as a Brahmin and started serving Prahlada to learn the techniques of achieving success, name and fame. Prahlada was very much pleased by the service of Lord Indra in the disguise of a brahmin. Seizing this opportunity, Indra beseeched Prahlada to teach him the secrets behind his success, fame and glory. Prahlada replied, “O Brahmin! It is the character by which I was able to win over the three worlds. I am never proud of being a king. I obey the instructions of my Guru Sukracharya and serve all elders with due respect. Whenever anybody approaches me for help, I shall extend whatever help that I can. These are the qualities of excellence. Success, glory, name and fame came of their own accord as I followed qualities of excellence.”</p>

		<p><strong>Duryodhana seeks guidance from Dhritarashtra</strong></p>
		<p>All of us are aware of the wicked nature of Duryodhana in the Mahabharata. He enjoyed wealth and power but there was no glory, name and fame attached to him as these come as a corollary to attaining qualities of excellence. Yudhisthira has earned a great name, fame and glory because of his qualities of excellence. Duryodhana wondered whether there was any shortcut way to acquire name, fame and glory. Even though Duryodhana never respected and obeyed his father, Dhritarashtra, he faked a brave face of humbleness and sought the guidance of his father. The experienced Dhritarashtra advised his son: “O my dear son! If you want to attain name, fame and glory like Yudhisthira, the only way for it is to acquire character enriched by qualities of excellence.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/062.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Duryodhana thought that name, fame and glory can be attained permanently by directly approaching them through shortcuts and that his father's varied experiences in life would provide several tips to him . But Dhritarashtra's advice was clear: the only way to attain eternal name, fame and glory is to imbibe the qualities of excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Let's do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>The methods followed by great people across the world are same, i.e. change the thoughts, synchronize the actions with these thoughts, turn these thoughts into habits and attain excellence in the chosen field. The attainment of excellence in the chosen field yields by-products like success, wealth and fame free of cost. One should not attempt tricks and manipulations to attain fame and wealth without attaining excellence. Another wonderful thing about the character which represents personal values is that it is carried over from birth to birth through the causal body. With this carrying - forward of character from birth to birth, an individual can become a mighty soul by continuously developing it over a series of births.</p>
