		<p><strong>Just wandering through life's events passively?</strong></p>
		<p>A vast majority of the people are prone to passing through the events of life passively, accepting the outcome. Getting educated from colleges/universities and settling in a job happens as a result of several known and unknown reasons which are commonly referred to as 'fate.' Subsequent to settling down in a job, the onward journey in the events of life happens according to their schedule with little or no exercise of the powers of the mind to control them. Is this acceptable to everybody? Surely, many do not settle with this but explore the other ways and means to control their life path.</p>

		<p>Human beings are blessed with infinite mind powers and are at a great advantage compared to other living beings. But what is the use of such infinite powers of the mind when a vast majority does not venture to manifest even an insignificant part of it? How much power of the mind is actually utilized by individuals? How much capacity of the mind was used by Albert Einstein? Is Albert Einstein a benchmark to estimate the capacity of the mind? Spiritual sciences say that powers of the mind are infinite! If that be the case, then there cannot be any benchmarks for the capacity of the mind; there are only higher and higher expressions of the mind, with no limit.</p>
		<p><strong>Is it an extremely difficult task that can be followed only by a few?</strong></p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		<p>In this modern age, we often hear many people talking about infinite powers of the mind. We also have several books that highlight the powers of the mind. The following questions often daunt our minds when we fail to get success in spite of our hard work while our colleagues/neighbours get it easily.</p>
		<p>One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.</p>

		<p>i)What is the use of the infinite powers of the mind when we are unable to use them practically in day-to-day life?</p>
		<p>ii) What prevents us from becoming rich, influential, happy and admirable when the mind of each of us has infinite potential?</p>
		<p>iii) Accepting that the mind has infinite powers and admitting that there are techniques to manifest these powers, why are we not able to harness our mind's infinite powers?</p>
		<p>iv) Are the methods of manifesting the powers of the mind very difficult to follow? Can these be adopted only by a few people with extraordinary qualities?</p>
		<p>v) Is each person not entitled to tap the powers of his/her mind?</p>
		<p>Baffled by such a dilemma, we tend to compare physically visible things like money power, position and social influence, and ignore invisible factors like the ability to manifest the powers of the mind. Unable to go to the root cause of our problems and to address them effectively, we tend to run our busy life mechanically.</p>
		<p>Let us now turn our attention to the facilities and support systems provided by God to achieve whatever we want.</p>
		<p><strong>Tathasthu Principle of Consciousness that bestows whatever we want!</strong></p>
		<p>A peculiar doubt haunts the minds of everybody. Do we really get what we want? To understand this, we need to look at the “Tathashu! May it be so!” principles behind Universal Consciousness. But let us first look at the principles of 'Mother Earth' which, in turn, help us to understand the principles of Universal Consciousness.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		<p><strong>Tathasthu from Mother Earth</strong></p>
		<p>All of us understand very well the laws that govern our lives. We are also aware of the laws of physics, chemistry , mathematics and such allied sciences. Electricity flows from a higher potential to a lower potential; water flows from a higher level to a lower level. These facts are well known to all. One of the laws that everybody can readily understand is that whatever be the seeds we sow on Earth, a corresponding tree will grow and fetch us the corresponding fruits. If we plant a papaya tree, we do not get mangoes. Mother Earth raises no objections to whatever may be the seeds that are planted and says, 'Tathasthu! May it be so!” thus helping us to get the corresponding tree and fruits. This can be readily understood by all.</p>

		<p><strong>Tathasthu from pure consciousness!</strong></p>
		<p>Each living being has an individual mind. But the mind is an inert matter (though made of subtle materials) and has no independent nature. The mind shines in the light of consciousness and appears to have an independent existence. It is like the Moon appearing to have light though it is the Sun's light which is reflected from the surface of the Moon. There is no individual consciousness; it is the same consciousness that shines behind the minds of all living beings and makes them appear to have independent powers.</p>
		<p>This consciousness is pure energy and it manifests itself though individual minds. Consciousness has no form, no name and no qualities; also it can take up any name, any form or any quality that is superimposed on it. It always says, “Tathasthu! May it be so!” to whatever that is being asked by the mind. Our thoughts are the means by which we engrave names, forms and qualities on pure consciousness and thereby, achieve the things projected by using energy from consciousness. The basic principle behind the manifestation of this pure consciousness is that the overall qualities remain neutral, i.e. neither good nor bad. Hence, at any given time there always will be some bad thoughts engraving themselves on pure consciousness manifesting malevolence and there will be an equal number of good thoughts engraving themselves on pure consciousness generating benevolence.</p>

		<p><strong>All the works that we have around us are simply the display of thought</strong></p>
		<p>All that is created by man in this world - from the bullock cart to the jet engine - first cropped up in the mind as a thought and the energy needed for giving a material shape to it was drawn from pure consciousness. As Swami Vivekananda says, “All the actions that we see in the world, all the movements in human society, all the works that we have around us, are simply the display of thought, the manifestation of the will of man. Machines or instruments, cities, ships, or men - of - war, all these are simply the manifestation of the will of man.”</p>

		<p>Hence our pure consciousness says, “Tathasthu! May it be so!” to whatever we seek from it. A person who broods upon evil thoughts will draw the necessary energy from pure consciousness and becomes bad. A person who dwells of ennobling thoughts draws the necessary energy from pure consciousness and becomes a noble man. However, the total quantum of the good and the bad that draw energy from pure consciousness is exactly equal and this ensures that the overall quality of pure consciousness is neutral.</p>
		<p>Let us now look at what the scriptures say about this.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>a) Gita: Lord Krishna</strong></p>
		<p>Different people pray to God for different things - some for money, some for name and fame, some others for health and yet some others for liberation. In the Bhagwad Gita, Lord Krishna says, “Whosoever worships me, for whatsoever desire, I meet him with that.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/018.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>b) Sri Ramakrishna: God is Kalpataru, but we pray standing near the Kalpataru</strong></p>
		<p>Sri Ramkrishna Paramahansa says, “God is the <em>Kalpataru,</em> the Wish-fulfilling Tree. You will certainly get whatever you ask of Him. But you must pray standing near the <em>Kalpataru.</em> Only then will your prayer be fulfilled. But you must remember another thing. God knows our inner feeling. A man gets the fulfillment of the desire he cherishes while practising sadhana. As one thinks, so one receives." Gospel-<em>P. 481</em></p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/019.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p class="text-center"><strong> Ask, it shall be given: Jesus Christ</strong></p>
		<p>In the Bible, Jesus Christ says, “Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/020.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>The assurance is that that we shall be given whatever that is sought by us. However, it is not a free lunch. We get what we seek only when we readily utilize the various opportunities presented to us with the right spirit and hard work.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<figcaption>The will is stronger than anything else. Everything must go down before the will.</figcaption>
			<img src="images/021.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>If we get whatever we want, what about destiny and past karma?</strong></p>
		<p>Well, if we get whatever we ask, then what about destiny and past karma? This question has been hotly debated for several centuries. It is a war between the logic and emotions controlling the human brain's left and right hemispheres, respectively. The final outcome of all such discussions is, “Our lives are both predetermined and at the same time not.” If everything depends on destiny then there can be no evolution, no progress, no improvements and no change. If we accept destiny, then we must necessarily accept free will by which that destiny was created!</p>
		<p>The doctrine of karma rests on the pillars of cause and effect, i.e. 'as you sow so shall you reap.' Everybody is equal and there are equal growth opportunities for everybody through free will. The merciless fate is not imposed forcefully on us and the door of free will is always open saying , 'Ask it shall be given' and hence, there is always an assurance of “Tathasthu ! May it be so!” from pure infinite consciousness. This is the inevitable process through which the future destiny of individuals is created. How is the present destiny of a person created ? Surely, it must be by the actions carried out by free will earlier. Then, how is a new destiny created? Surely it must be through the free will operating now.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<figcaption>Man has infinite power within himself, and he can realize it… It can be done; but he does not believe in it.</figcaption>
			<img src="images/022.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Hence at any given instant of time, every living being has absolute freedom to think and act. But the result is always a combination of various factors. There are no restrictions whatsoever on our free will. It creates our future destiny. Then why should we be bogged down by destiny created by the past and ignore the powerful tool of free will that creates our future destiny? Pure consciousness is always at our disposal and it always depends on the direction in which we position ourselves.</p>
		<p><strong>We can become whatever we want -Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/023.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>While giving a series of lectures on 'Karma Yoga' in Western countries to throw light on the topic ' Karma in its effect on character ', Swami Vivekananda said, “Our Karma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate. We are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we are now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly follows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by our present actions; so we have to know how to act. You will say, 'What is the use of learning how to work? Everyone works in some way or other in this world.' But there is such a thing as frittering away our energies. With regard to Karma-Yoga, the Gita says that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science; by knowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results. You must remember that all work is simply to bring out the power of the mind which is already there, to wake up the soul. The power is inside every man, so is knowing; the different works are like blows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.”</p>
		<p><strong>Thought is the primary tool to ask God whatever we desire</strong></p>
		<p>Everybody understands prayer is the means to ask God. But everybody may not believe in God. Whether we do it voluntarily or involuntarily, every thought and wish that emanate from our minds comes from pure consciousness. All the minds of living beings are illuminated by the same pure consciousness. Thoughts emanate continuously from our minds thereby giving a name, shape and <span>quality to our pure consciousness which is formless, nameless and beyond attributes. The required energy is drawn from pure consciousness to materialize what is being asked for by the mind. The “Tathasthu! May it be so!” assures us that we will get what we asked by presenting us with opportunities which are to be grabbed. We have to translate these thoughts into things by necessary actions. Hence, the primary tool to ask from God or pure consciousness is thought. As Professor William James, an American psychologist and philosopher, rightly pointed out, “ Man can alter his life by altering his thinking.” </span></p>
		<p><strong>How does the help of God come to us when we seek something?</strong></p>
		<p>If we pray to God for the health of a person who needs to undergo surgery, God himself does not come to his house and cure him through a painless surgery without any hospital bills to be paid. But surely God will extend his help through relatives raising the money needed for the surgery, friends assisting him in the hospital and finally, through the expertise of the doctor to make the surgery highly successful.</p>
		<p>Similarly, if we pray to God for Rs. 1 crore, he does not pack bundles of Rs. 1,000/- notes in a gunny bag and drop the bag in your worship room. The response to prayer comes in different forms and provides guidance for how to move forward. We need to follow the directions and opportunities sent by God; we should work on them by readily grabbing them.</p>
		<p>Explaining that prayer to God facilitates solutions in many ways, Abdul Kalam - in his book “Wings of Fire”- writes, “This could come from an encounter with another person, from a word, a gesture or even a look. Many a time it could happen even through a book, a conversation, some phrase, even a line of poem or mere sight of a picture.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/024.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>If we ignore all the help extended in response to our prayers, then our chances to realize for what we pray may be less. Let us look at a nice fable that illustrates this point.</p>
		<p><strong>Grab the solutions sent by God in response to prayers and implement them</strong></p>
		<p>There was a village near a sea coast. The meteorological department sent out a warning about impending floods and cyclone. The district administrative authorities deputed their staff to the village to persuade the villagers to move to safe places as a precautionary measure. There lived an adamant and dogmatic devotee of God in the village. He refused to move out of the village and prayed to God to save his life. Meanwhile, the floods started inundating the village and the water level started rising. In response to the prayers of the devotee, God created a thought in the mind of the District Superintendent of Police to make his team take another round of the village to check that all were safe. The police team reached the village in its jeep and found the lonely devotee of God left alone in the village. They tried to persuade him to come along with them. But the adamant and dogmatic devotee refused to go with them. He was convinced that God Himself would come and save him.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Time and tide wait for no man! The water level kept on rising in the village and the devotee went up to the second floor of his house and waited for God to come and rescue him. God was very worried about the devotee and made another attempt to save him. A fisherman from the village who had gone out to the sea for fishing was returning due to the bad weather conditions. God created an idea in his mind to look out for any person needing help. Driven by this unconscious thought, the boatman rowed his boat towards the devotee standing on the second floor of his house. He tried to persuade the devotee repeatedly to come with him in the boat and save his life. But the devotee refused to leave his house and stubbornly insisted that God would come and save him.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>With a further rise in the water level, the devotee was forced to climb to the terrace of the house. He waited for God to come. The anxiety of God increased due to the foolishness of His devotee who was intensely praying but refusing to accept the help sent in response to his prayers. God wanted to rescue the devotee at any cost and He created a thought in the mind of the State Home Minister to initiate an aerial survey by helicopter to ensure that nobody was left in the inundated village. Accordingly, the State Home Minister immediately picked up his mobile phone and ordered that the Disaster Management Group immediately conduct an aerial survey of the flooded village. The army swung into action with a helicopter and finding a lonely person on the terrace of a house, flew the helicopter towards him and tried to persuade him to come along with them. But, as usual, our dogmatic devotee refused to be rescued. He insisted that God would come and save him.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/030.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>The water level kept on rising and the dogmatic devotee was washed away in the floods. He reached God after death and started vilifying God saying that God did not bother to come down to rescue him in spite of his intense prayers. God explained to the devotee that he had sent help three times - first, by sending the police jeep; next by sending the fisherman and finally, by sending the helicopter. God reiterated the famous proverb to the devotee, “God helps those who help themselves.”</p>
		<p><strong>God is the third type of doctor</strong></p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/031.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa used to speak of three types of doctors. The first type of doctors examine the patients and just issue a prescription. They do not bother to check whether the patients are taking the medicine and recovering. The second type of doctors issue the prescriptions and persuade their patients to take medicine regularly but they do not bother to keep track of the level of recuperation of each patient from the disease. The third type of doctors are the best doctors. They not only prescribe medicines but also force open the mouths of the patients and administer the drug. These doctors are very much concerned about the recovery of their patients. But there are some patients who vomit the administered drug and the doctor is helpless in such a situation. Similarly, when we ask or pray for help from God, we should bank upon the opportunities sent by God through various means and act upon them. If we do not take advantage of the opportunities presented by God to us, then even God cannot help us vindicating the proverb, “God helps those who help themselves”.</p>
		<p><strong>Let's do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>Though there appear to be individual minds, the pure consciousness that gives energy to all minds is the same. This pure consciousness is neutral in nature without name, form or attribute. It is the thought impressed on pure consciousness that gives it a name, form or attribute. The necessary energy needed for materializing the projections of thought are drawn from pure consciousness. This pure consciousness always says, “Tathashu! May it be so!” on whatever is being asked by the thought. “Ask, it shall be given” is its principle and whatever is asked is given regardless of its being either good or bad.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/032.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>One needs to understand the conditions under which “Tathasthu! May it be so!” is granted. There is no free lunch for anybody. Pure consciousness gives many clues, directions and solutions to the mind based on what is being asked. The individual mind has to grab the opportunities presented to it and act upon them.</p>
		<p>Hence, thought is the primary tool that governs our lives. Changing the thought changes our lives. Thought is nothing but asking something from pure consciousness.</p>
