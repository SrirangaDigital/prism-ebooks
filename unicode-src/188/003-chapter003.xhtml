		<p>Swami Vivekananda's blueprint for success says the next step after taking up an idea is to think of it, dream of it and live on it. It is also called 'Visualization' or 'constantly dreaming of goals'. It is a process of creating and seeing a mental picture of what we want to achieve. This should occur as a continuous process till the time we attain our cherished goal.</p>
		<p>Let us look at Swami Vivekananda's style of focusing on a single idea. Describing his state of mind with focus on the single idea of fulfilling his life mission of uplifting the people, Swami Vivekananda wrote a letter to his friend: “Two years of physical suffering have taken away twenty years of my life. Well, but the soul changeth not, does it? It is there, the same madcap Atman, mad upon one idea, intent and intense.”</p>
		<p><strong>Only our dominant thoughts drive our actions</strong></p>
		<p>In the previous chapters we saw that our ideas (thoughts) engrave forms on our pure consciousness and draw the necessary energy from it to materialize the ideas into reality. Thoughts drive our physical body to carry out actions just like a rail engine hauls the coaches.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/064.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>However, there are several thoughts arising in our minds and the weaker thoughts amongst them do not drive our actions but remain as mere wish lists, yielding no practical results. These are like weeds in the garden of our mind that eat away the precious resources of the mind and produce no results.</p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “By knowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results. You must remember that all this work is simply to bring out the power of the mind which is already there, to wake up the soul. The power is inside every man, so is the knowing; the different works are like blows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.”</p>
		<p><strong>Visualization: Positioning thoughts as dominant thoughts that need action</strong></p>
		<p>We may think of many things but all the thoughts do not lead to action. Among the thoughts, only dominant thoughts drive our actions while the weaker thoughts just consume our mind's capacity without yielding any practical results. So, thoughts requiring action should be positioned as dominant thoughts. This can be achieved through visualization / constantly thinking ( dreaming) of ideas that we desire to achieve. When the same ideas are thought, again and again, they become dominant thoughts and propel us into action.</p>
		<p><strong>Ichcha Shakti &#38; Kriya Shakti</strong></p>
		<p>Hindu scriptures describe 'Ichcha Shakti' and 'Kriya Shakti'. 'Ichcha shakti' is the power of intention or the power of the will. The implementation part of intentions is executed by 'kriya shakti.' We need a right combination of 'Ichcha shakti' and 'Kriya shakti'.</p>
		<p>Think all of you that you are the infinitely powerful Atman, and see what strength comes out.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/065.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>This is the way to success: Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<p>Let us once again remember Swami Vivekananda's message: “Take one thing up and do it, and see the end of it, and before you have seen the end, do not give it up. He who can become mad with an idea, he alone sees light. Those that only take a nibble here and a nibble there will never attain anything. They may titillate their nerves for a moment, but there it will end. Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life -- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”</p>
		<p><strong>Go to work, the rest will come:</strong></p>
		<p>Let us now look at one of the letters written by Swami Vivekananda to his Madras disciple, Alasinga, persuading him to move from an architect's role to an engineer's role so that his visualization could be translated into reality.</p>
		<p class="text-right">U.S.A. 1894</p>
		<p>Dear Alasinga,</p>
		<p>Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road saw an old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire of him the whereabouts of a certain place. "How far is such and such a village?" he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the traveller turned to go away. The old man then stood up and said, "The village of__ is only a mile from here." "What!" said the tramp, "Why did you not speak when I asked you before?" "Because then", said the old man, "you seemed so halting and careless about proceeding, but now you are starting off in good earnest, and you have a right to an answer."</p>
		<p>Will you remember this story, my son? Go to work, the rest will come: "Whosoever not trusting in anything else but Me, rests on Me, I supply him with everything he needs" (Gita, IX.22). This is no dream.</p>
		<p class="text-right">Yours<br /> Swami Vivekananda</p>
		<p><strong>What is the contribution of visualization in attaining our goals?</strong></p>
		<p>Before proceeding further into the study of the marvelous powers of visualization in attaining our cherished goals, let us take a look at two common examples.</p>
		<p>A dream home or dream car is owned by many people. In India, every common man's wish is to have his own home and an upper middle class family's wish is to own a car. Though this is wishful thinking by many, only those who can constantly dream about their desired thoughts can progress towards the desired goal. Visualization enables them to give strength to their thoughts and shows the way forward. It is their visualization/dream that drives them to search all possibilities and grab the opportunities. They stand as testimonials to the proverb, 'Where there is will, there is a way'. They imagine - day and in and day out -that they already have a house/car that they wished for and strongly attract these into their lives. They imagine various situations utilizing these assets. Their minds see the non-reality as a reality and they succeed in achieving what they desire. This is all due to the infinite pure consciousness giving its blessings to these most ambitious people: <em>'Tathasthu!</em> May it be so!'</p>

		<p>Great convictions are the mothers of great deeds.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/068.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p></p>
		<p>Let us now take another common example to understand how visualization yields fruits. Visualization plays a vital role in steering the mind in the direction of the things most sought after by us. Let us now look at how a singer, a dancer, an artist, a speaker and an athlete bank upon the visualization as the means to achieve the end-result. They repeatedly imagine that they are giving live performances while doing the rehearsals. They are steering their minds towards the end-result. The visualization works as an energy spinner for them to practise more and more to achieve perfection to reach their goal.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		</figure>
		<p>Having studied these two examples to get quick insights into the effects of visualization, let us now look at how constantly thinking of attaining our cherished goals translates the dreams into reality. It fetches us seven invauable benefits!</p>
		<p>All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers.</p>

		<p><strong>Seven Invaluable Benefits from the constant dreaming of the chosen goal!</strong></p>
		<ol class="roman">
			<li>i)Visualization gives wings to our thoughts.</li>
			<li>ii)Visualization persuades us.</li>
			<li>iii)Visulization makes law of attraction yield fruits to our thoughts.</li>
			<li>iv) Visualization creates fire in the belly.</li>
			<li>v) Visulization opens the magical eye that spots opporunities in problems.</li>
			<li>vi) Visulization makes us a devotee of the goal and grants us the goal.</li>
			<li>vii) Visualization generates hope.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Let us look at these in detail.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>i)Visualization gives wings to our thoughts</strong></p>
		<p>Visualization gives wings of imagination to our thoughts so that they soar high to give the acceleration to surge ahead. Visualization refers to the imagining of oneself to be in the state of having achieved the end result. It facilitates us into translating the wishful thinking into reality. The more we visualize, the more will be the positive energy in us to propel our actions towards the end result. It changes our mind-set and floods us with excessive energy to surge ahead.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/074.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>ii)Persuasive powers of visualization</strong></p>
		<p>While carrying out our activities, we co-ordinate with several people and get involved in the process of persuasion and follow-up to motivate them. Charity begins at home! We need the functions of persuasion, follow-up and motivation to be carried out first within ourselves. Who does this job within us? It is done by none other than our constant dreaming of things that we want to achieve. It generates self-motivation fueled by the burning desire to succeed generated by constantly thinking of the same idea.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/075.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>The power of visualization drives away our fears and enables us to move forward. A person with great visualization never gives up his mission even when he faces stumbling blocks. He moves forward by finding solutions and does not rest till he attains his goal. Visualization provides fresh energy every time we are stuck and gives us a push to move forward. It is the great persuasion power from within.</p>
		<p><strong>iii)Visualization makes law of attraction yield fruits to our thoughts</strong></p>
		<p>Most of us are aware of the law of attraction. It simply says that you attract into your life whatever you think about. Your dominant thought will find a way to manifest itself. A drunkard attracts another drunkard, a devotee attracts another devotee, a successful man attracts another successful man and a pessimist attracts another pessimist. When you dream of things -again and again - what is going to happen? We attract similar things into our lives. Constant thinking of the same goals magnetizes and attracts the needed things into our lives.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/076.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>While delivering lectures on 'Karma Yoga' in the Western countries, Swami Vivekananda said, “Just as every action that emanates from us comes back to us as reaction, even so our actions may act on other people and theirs on us. Perhaps all of you have observed it as a fact that when persons do evil actions, they become more and more evil, and when they begin to do good, they become stronger and stronger and learn to do good at all times. This intensification of the influence of action cannot be explained on any other ground than that we can act and react upon each other. To take an illustration from physical science, when I am doing a certain action, my mind may be said to be in a certain state of vibration; all minds which are in similar circumstances will have the tendency to be affected by my mind. If there are different musical instruments tuned alike in one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck, the others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same note . So all minds that have the same tension, so to say, will be equally affected by the same thought. Of course, this influence of thought on mind will vary according to distance and other causes, but the mind is always open to affection. Suppose I am doing an evil act, my mind is in a certain state of vibration, and all minds in the universe, which are in a similar state, have the possibility of being affected by the vibration of my mind. So, when I am doing a good action, my mind is in another state of vibration; and all minds similarly strung have the possibility of being affected by my mind; and this power of mind upon mind is more or less according as the force of the tension is greater or less.”</p>

		<p><strong>iv) Visualization creates fire in the belly</strong></p>
		<p>Self-motivation facilitates us to move forward through our own inner fire. While we get inspiration from other great persons, self-motivation is generated internally by constantly thinking of our cherished goals. Self-motivation is far more powerful than inspiration derived from others. It is relevant here to remember this quote of Abraham Lincoln: “Your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/083.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Self -motivation generated by visualization is like a self-driven engine. It uses the mind's fuel and creates an urge to act. In colloquial terms this is called 'fire in the belly'.</p>
		<p><strong>v) Visualization opens the magical eye that spots opportunities in problems</strong></p>
		<p>A person who constantly dreams of his chosen goal develops wonderful inner eyes that spot only opportunities shining behind his problems and grabs all the opportunities with the fire in his belly. Such a mind - with X-ray talents - sees all the possibilities available to it to move forward. We never do the things that we do not like at all; we do things only when we see clearly the benefits from doing it.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/084.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>However, if a person has negative thoughts about a goal, then he will only see the problems in all the opportunities and will let them slip off. This type of person keeps on waiting for the best opportunities in which there are no problems at all! He never bothers to seriously think whether there exist opportunities in which there are no problems at all! When a person does not see the benefits, he never moves forward.</p>
		<p><strong>vi) Visualization makes us a devotee of the goal and grants us the goal</strong></p>
		<p>When a person likes a cherished goal, he becomes a devotee of it and worships it. His entire mental energy gets channelized towards it. As his love for the cherished goal increases by the constant thinking of it, his inner energy for its execution gets accelerated by leaps and bounds. Then his mind becomes a fountain of energy by constantly dreaming of the goal. When there is a liking for a goal, the man is moved by several mysterious strings towards its fulfillment. But if a man does not like the same thing, he will move in the opposite direction.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/085.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>vii) Visualization generates hope</strong></p>
		<p>A mind constantly thinking of the same goal becomes positive. This positive nature of the mind nurtures hope in us. Hope is the prime motivational power that drives our lives. It is only because of hope that human beings continue to live on Earth. Hope gives continuity to our actions.</p>
		<p><strong>What is the secret behind advertising of products by various companies?</strong></p>
		<p>We know that across the world, several thousands of crores of rupees are being spent every month by various companies towards advertising their products! What makes them spend so much of money on advertising? It is nothing but implanting visualization in the minds of customers which in turn motivates the customers to buy their product. The advertising agencies study the customer base for the particular product and analyze the customers preferences, habits and mind-set. They use a suitable role model in the advertisement using the product. Most often, celebrities from the film industry, cricket etc. are used as brand ambassadors for endorsements. The designing of the advertisement is done in such a way that it creates a strong visualization of the product in the mind of the customer. These advertisements are then put on T.V channels, in newspapers, banners, wall posters etc. to reach the minds of potential customers viewing it. A kid looks at an advertisement about a bicycle on T.V. The advertisement is daily visualized in the kid's mind. The end result is obvious - his parents are forced to go to the market and bring the cycle home!</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/086.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Hence, the basic principle involved in the advertising of products is creating a strong visualization in the minds of the prospective customers about these products.</p>
		<p><strong>Creating a shared Vision across organizations</strong></p>
		<p>Just as individuals need to visualize their goals and translate these into reality, every company (organization) should visualize what it should be. In the corporate world, this is referred to as the 'Vision, Mission &#38; Values Statement' of the company. The Vision, Mission and Values statement of the company is widely communicated to all its employees and all efforts of the company (from the Managing Director down to the rank and file employee) are to be directed towards realizing the Vision, Mission and Values of the company.</p>
		<p>The Vision, Mission and Values statements are brief statements composed of the most inspiring words by the top management of the company and used as a tool to set the direction for the future of the company; core values that have to be followed in achieving this goal. A shared vision is created across the organization and all employees are driven into achieving the cherished vision of the company.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/087.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Using these Vision- Mission statements, a company can communicate its intentions in the most powerful manner to its employees and motivate members of the team to move in the direction of achieving its vision. The Vision, Mission and Values statement of the company defines its purpose and primary objectives.</p>
		<p>When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state.</p>

		<p>Let us now look at the way by which Winston Churchill used the 'shared vision' approach for his nation. During the Second World War, he was the Prime Minister as well as the Defence Minister of Britain. As the Defence Minister of Britain, Winston Churchill was well aware of his country 's weaknesses to face the German menace. But he was adept in communication skills as he was a gifted orator. He created a shared vision across the country by charging the people with thoughts of victory. This shared vision raised the morale of the armed forces and they displayed excellence at war.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		</figure>
		<p><strong>What is the importance of using shared vision for individuals?</strong></p>
		<p>We have seen above how Vision-Mission statements are used across the organization to channelize the energies of everyone towards the cherished goal. But what does this mean to an individual? If the individual is in the field of games, sports, music, art, dance etc., then his entire career may depend upon his individual talents. But if the individual has goals that require the participation of several others in fulfilling and achieving his vision e.g. effective entrepreneurship of private or social organizations, then it becomes necessary for the individual to extend the visualization and dreams of his goals with all others whose involvement is needed and all such people also need to be charged with the idea of attaining the common goal.</p>
		<p>Individuals can learn many things from Swami Vivekananda in creating a shared vision among his team members to channelize the group's energy towards the common goal.</p>
		<p>With his 'man-making religion', Swami Vivekananda roused the sleeping nation. His new perspective of 'Karma Yoga' with its nucleus of 'service to humanity is service to God' created a shared vision across the world and this shared vision is still motivating several millions of persons across the globe.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/094.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>The charisma of Swami Vivekananda lies in his ability to magnetize people with the most inspiring words and drive them into action for achieving the cherished vision. Referring to the amazing abilities of Swami Vivekananda to drive people towards his cherished vision, Roma Rolland said, “I can't touch these sayings of his …. without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock. And what shocks, what transports, must have been produced when in burning words they were issued from the lips of the hero.”</p>

		<p><strong>Visualization as the means to attain God in spiritual practices!</strong></p>
		<p>It is no surprise that all principles in the materialistic world are used for spiritual purposes. The only difference is the direction of the usage. Let us see now how the principle of visualization is used in the spiritual field. When a devotee is meditating on his chosen deity, he is prone to feel that God is dwelling somewhere in Heaven. The devotee may feel a huge gap due to the imagination of the distance barrier between him and God. To build intimate relationships between the devotee and God, Hindu scriptures provide a technique called 'Bhava'. We can readily see that it is similar to visualization used in the materialistic world, but used in a different direction. These 'bhavas' take five different modes to suit the temperament and liking of the devotee. Swami Vivekananda described these bhavas in a touching way in his lectures given on <strong>'Bhakti Yoga'</strong> in the Western countries. It is pertinent here to look at these bhavas to understand how visualization leads to the attainment of the cherished goal. </p>
		<p><strong>Types of 'Bhavas' (Visualizations) between devotee and God</strong></p>
		<p>The visualization of God is referred to as <em>“Bhava”</em> in the Hindu scriptures. This bhava can take five different variations to suit the individual tastes, i.e. Shanta, Dasya, Sakhya, Vatsalya and Mathura.</p>
		<p><strong>i)</strong><em>Shanta bhava :</em> In this the devotee is peaceful. He does not dance nor jump with high emotions. Here the devotee visualizes God's nature as the Supreme spirit and divinity. Bhishma's visualization of Lord Krishna is an example of <em>Shanta Bhava.</em></p>
		<p><strong>ii)</strong><em>Dasya Bhava :</em> In Dasya Bhava, the devotee visualizes that he is a servant of the Lord. Hanuman's devotion to Lord Rama is the perfect example of <strong>Dasya Bhava.</strong></p> 
		<p><strong>iii)</strong><em>Sakhya Bhava</em><strong>(Friend attitude)</strong>: Here the devotee visualizes God as his close friend. Arjuna's devotion towards Lord Krishna is the perfect example of <em>Sakhya Bhava.</em> Here God becomes our friend - the friend who is near, the friend to whom we may freely tell all the tales and woes of our lives. The inner-most secrets of our hearts we place before God with the greatest assurance of safety and support. Here God is the friend whom the devotee accepts as an equal. In <em>Sakhya Bhava</em>, God is viewed as our playmate.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/096.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>iv)</strong><em>Vatsalya Bhava:</em> Here the devotee visualizes God as his offspring and always thinks of Him with parental love. Kausalya's love for Lord Rama and Yashoda's love for Lord Krishna are perfect examples of <em>Vatsalya Bhava.</em> In <em>Vatsalya Bhava,</em> the devotee loves God not as a father but as his child. This may seem peculiar but it is a discipline to enable us to detach all ideas of power from the concept of God. Here the devotee does not care to conceive God as mighty, majestic and glorious.</p>
		<p><strong>v)</strong><em>Madhura Bhava:</em> In <em>Madhura Bhava,</em> the devotee visualizes God as his sweet-heart. It is <em>Atma Samarpana</em> (complete surrender of self to God). Radha's love for Krishna is an example of Madhura Bhva. However, <em>Madhura Bhava</em> is not recommended as a means for ordinary devotees due to the various pitfalls involved!</p>
		<p><strong>Let's do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>We need to give strength and continuity to our thoughts by constantly dreaming of them. In visualization, one imagines that one is already in the state of achieving the goal and by floating on that energy, one draws the motivation to drive his/her actions. We can readily see that the basic principle behind the multi-billion dollar advertising industry is nothing but creating a strong visualization of the product in the minds of customers so that they are driven to purchase the advertised product. The visualization technique is used not only at the individual level but also at the organizational (company) level to realize their dreams by issuing Vision-Mission statements and thereby providing a shared vision across the organization. We can also see that the visualization technique is used even in spiritual practices as a means to attain God.</p>
