		<p><strong>How much time for visualization and how much time to make it work?</strong></p>
		<p>In the previous chapter, we saw how visualization/constant dreaming and thinking of a goal can help in translating it into a reality. Constantly dreaming of big things (visualizing it) is one form of work, and translating the dreams into action is another form of work. We need to clearly identify how much of our time resources need to be allocated for visualization and how much to the execution of the work. The relative percentage of time resources to be allocated to each of these two important activities depends on the individual's position in an organization. Now let us look at the functioning of the left and right parts of the brain. We shall also talk about the thinkers and the doers!</p>
		<p><strong>The functions of the left and right portions of the brain</strong></p>
		<p>Human brain is primarily classified into two portions – namely, the left side of the brain and the right side of the brain. Each of these sides do specific tasks in our day-to-day lives. Every individual has his preferred thinking style and this style labels him as a left–side brain thinker (colloquially referred to as left – brained persons) or a right–side brain thinker (colloquially referred as right – brained person ). This does not mean that one can exclusively use either the right side of the brain or the left side of the brain. However, one side of the brain dominates his/her thinking style.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The left side of the brain is detail-oriented, logical, practical, objective, strategy-oriented and reality-based. The right side of the brain is imagination-oriented, focused on the big picture, fantasy-based, creative and subjective in outlook Accordingly, a person who is more logical, analytical and objective in his outlook is called a 'left –brained person' while a person with more imagination, intuition, creativity and subjectivity is called a 'right – brained person'. The right-brain and left-brain theory is attributed to Roger W. Sperry who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1981.</p>
		<p><strong>Visualization &#38; Execution -the respective functions of the right and left portions of the brain</strong></p>
		<p>The visualization, i.e. constant dreaming/imagination of a cherished goal, referred to in the previous chapter, is essentially a function of the right brain. It is like an architect who imagines and draws up a plan. The left - brain is logic - based and is like an engineer who executes the job as per the plan prepared by the architect. To attain qualities of excellence and thereby, get wealth and success free of cost, we need to be an architect as well as an engineer.</p>
		<p>Let us now move to the topic of thinkers and doers.</p>
		<p><strong>The thinkers: The right -brained persons</strong></p>
		<p>Right–brain dominant persons are very good visionaries but they do not have execution focus to translate their dreams into reality. These people can see very well into the future and articulate wonderful things. They are experts in making power-point presentations. Their brains work much faster than their physical bodies. But when it comes to execution, they lack the managerial skills to get the work done. They have several blind-spots in inter-personal relationships and in managing the teams. Such people can shine only when they are backed by a very strong team with excellent execution skills. Otherwise, these thinkers fail in translating their dreams into reality due to lack of practical skills.</p>

		<p><strong>Let us illustrate this view point with a story!</strong></p>
		<p>There was a very strong man who could walk very fast carrying heavy loads but he was blind. So he could not utilize his strong body to cross the road bustling with heavy vehicular traffic. There was another man who had a sharp intellect and good eyesight but unfortunately he was lame and could not walk. He too could not use his intellectual abilities to cross the road in view of the heavy traffic. Then these two, who could not cross the busy road independently, came to an understanding. The blind man carried the lame person on his shoulders. The lame person gave directions to the blind man who was carrying him; as a result of this co-ordination both crossed the road safely dodging the heavy vehicular traffic.</p>
		<p>If one has great visionary skills but does not have managerial skills to implement his plans, then he should have a strong team of down-to-earth practical persons for achieving his cherished goals. The above story illustrates this point in a practical way.</p>
		<p><strong>The doers: The left- brained persons</strong></p>
		<p>These left–brained persons are down-to-earth practical persons. They are workaholics and can work - day in and day out. They can manage people and events very well and have excellent interpersonal skills. These people have a dominant left brain. But the right - brain is not at par with the left part of the brain. These people do not have the visionary skills. Ask them to make a detailed plan for a new project and their work will never be done. Give them a detailed project report and ask them to execute it; they will work out miracles! These people need visionaries to guide them in their work. In the absence of visionary people leading them, their workaholic abilities cannot achieve great results.</p>

		<p><strong>Thinkers and doers</strong></p>
		<p>In reality, we cannot have only thinkers or doers. Everybody is a combination of a thinker and a doer. The percentage of thinker and doer in a given person must be rightly balanced according to the nature and position of the person in an organization. There cannot be a universal formula applicable for everybody because such a universal formula will destroy everything. A person in a particular job needs a certain percentage of usage of the left and right parts of the brain; and the non-allocation of the right resources to each side of the brain will lead to his failure in that job position.</p>
		<p>Let us now take a look at the top-level management, middle-level management and the work force in a company to understand this.</p>
		<p><strong>Top-level management, middle-level management and work force</strong></p>
		<p>There are no exclusive thinkers and no exclusive doers in any organization. Depending on the nature of our work and the position we hold in the organization, we are required to focus more on one aspect than on another. Let us understand this more by studying the roles of the top-level management, middle -level management and the down-the-line work force in a company.</p>
		<p><strong>a)Top-Level Management : Thinking is the primary responsibility and doing is the secondary responsibility</strong></p>
		<p>The primary responsibility of the top management is to show direction to the work force of the company. Its members should be think -tanks and great visionaries. They have to focus on creating opportunities for the growth of the company. They need to spend several hours with deep thinking and visualize benefits from future opportunities as well as gear up the present organizational set-up to face future challenges. We can understand this well by considering an organization as a bicycle. The top management represents the front wheel which shows direction to the power generated by back wheel and the work force represents the rear wheel which generates the power of movement by constant pedaling ; and the bicycle, taken together with all its parts, represents the company. The job of the work force is to produce goods and its members are the doers. The job of the top management is to provide direction to the work force and its members are the thinkers.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Top management has primary responsibility of visionary work and secondary responsibility of execution of work.</p>
		<p>But if members of the top management develop an attitude that their only job is to be visionaries and show direction to the work force and execution is none of their business, then the company is sure to fail. While providing guidance through vision is the primary responsibility of its top management, its members are also responsible for the execution of the work to translate the company's vision into a reality. The top management members should effectively discharge their secondary responsibility of execution of work by allocating sufficient time to drive their teams towards better performance.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/107.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>From the work point of view, we see very often that the top management people work for 100+ hours in a week while the down-the-line work force has only 48 hours of work. Thus, top management people work for longer hours than the usual work force in the company, but the nature of their work is entirely different from the work of a down-theline employee . The only issue is the right allocation of their time resources to the right brain as well as to the left, i.e. visionary work and work execution focus. They should not excessively focus their energies on execution thereby neglecting the visionary work of showing direction to the teams nor should they excessively become visionaries and theoretical/ idealistic persons with no focus on work execution. Shouldering the primary responsibility for visionary work without neglecting the secondary responsibility of focus on execution of the work is the key factor for the success of people chairing top management jobs.</p>

		<p>Empirically we can say that top management people should be 70% right -brained and a 30% left -brained.</p>
		<p><strong>Clues to have an effective top management from Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<p>Persons chairing positions of top management can learn many things from Swami Vivekananda. Let us look at one of the incidents from the life of Swami Vivekananda which shows the way the division of labour and delegation of work needs to be followed by the top management people who must desist from too much involvement in the execution of the work and give importance to visionary work. In a letter written from Detroit to Mary Hale on 15th March, 1894, Swami Vivekananda wrote: “ But I do not know – I have become very sad in my heart since I am here. I do not know why I am wearied of lecturing and all that nonsense. This mixing up with hundreds of human animals, male and female, has disturbed me. I will tell you what my taste. I cannot write – cannot speak- but I can think in deep, and when I am heated I can speak fire. But it should be a select few – very select few. And let them carry and sow my ideas broadcast if they will- not I. It is only just a division of labour. The same man never succeeded in thinking and in casting his thoughts all around. Such thoughts are not worth a penny.”</p>
		<p>Let not the barks of puppies frighten you, - no not even the thunderbolts of heaven.</p>

		<p><strong>b) Middle-Level Management: Execution of work is the primary responsibility and visionary work is the secondary responsibility</strong></p>
				<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/110.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>A middle-level management job is to implement the policies and directions given by top management. The role of these persons is complementary to that of the top management people. Hence, their primary responsibility is the execution of vision/directions provided by the top management people and their secondary responsibility is the visionary role. Being in the middle–level, they need to support top management persons in creating the vision and opportunities for the growth of the company. If middle -level management teams focus excessively on becoming visionaries (which is only their secondary responsibilities) and lose sight of focus on the execution of the work (which is their primary responsibility), there is no need to mention the fate of the company. The fundamental factor for the success of people in middle-level management is their focus on the execution of work and this will yield good results.</p>

		<p>Middle-level management teams are pillars of the company. They tranaslate the vision foreseen by the top management persons into reality by meticulous execution of their work. They need to possess excellent inter-realtionship skills as they have to motivate the down-the-line work force to implement the work. There is a sea of difference in the relationships between the top management &lt;—&gt; middle-level management and that of the middle-level &lt;—&gt; down-the-line work force.</p>
		<p>Empirically, we can say that the middle-level management should be 70% left - brained and 30% right – brained.</p>
		<p><strong>Balancing of left and right sides of the brain capacities for effective team work – Swami Vivekananda's methods</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda wanted the use of the right combination of the left -brained and right -brained persons in his team members so that they work complementarily to one another to yield results. Accordingly, while delegating his work to his team members, he took special care to ensure that each team consisted of some people with a strong left brain and some others with a strong right brain so that in totality , the team had the strength of both the left and right brains ( i.e. thinkers and doers). Let us now look at one of the incidents from the life of Swami Vivekananda wherein he assigned a joint project to G.G. Narasimhachariyar and Alisinga and made use of the total power of the left and right brained persons.</p>
		<p class="text-right">U.S.A.<br />1894</p>
		<p> Dear Alasinga,</p>
		<p>Everything will come to you if you put your shoulders to the wheel. Now, go to work! <strong>G. G.'s nature is of the emotional type, you have a level head; so work together; plunge in;</strong> this is only the beginning. Do not try to be a ruler. He is the best ruler who can serve well. Be true unto death. The work we want --we do not seek wealth, name or fame. . . . Be brave. . .. Be perfectly unselfish, and you will be sure to succeed. . . .</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		<p>Without losing the independence in work, show all regards to your superiors. Work in harmony. . . . My children must be ready to jump into fire, if needed, to accomplish their work. Now work, work, work! We will stop and compare notes later on. Have patience, perseverance, and purity.</p>

		<p class="text-right">Yours Vivekananda</p>
		<p><strong>c) The down-the-level work force: Execution of work is the only responsibility</strong></p>
		<p>These represent a vast majority of the people in the company. Their primary responsibility is the execution of work and their secondary responsibility is also the execution of work. Hence, people who work very hard become highly successful in this group get elevated to higher positions over a period of time. This segment have a very high aptitude for learning new things and constantly improve their capabilities to climb higher up the ladder. Empirically we can say that these people should be 100% left - brained which may sound unfair as their right- brain capacities are not given any chance to exhibit their capabilities. But, they may find many opportunities to do this. Nowadays, many companies follow the principle of 'My opinion counts at the work place' and encourage members of the down–the-line work force to put forward their innovative ideas for the growth of the company. Such ideas are evaluated by an unbiased panel of judges, and worthy ideas are duly honoured and implemented. Swami Vivekananda's message of “Work, Work, Work. Let this be your motto!” should be the watchword for this segment of the work force.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Workforce / employees have primary responsibility of executing the work and their secondary responsibility is also execution of work only.</p>

		</figure>
		<p><strong>Let's do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>We have studied the characteristic thinking styles of right -brained persons and left – brained persons. Every individual has his preferred thinking style and this style labels him as a left- brained thinker or right- brained thinker. This does not mean that one can use exclusively either the right - brain or the left - brain dominates his/her thinking style. The thinkers are right-dominant brain people and doers are left– dominant brain people. There are no exclusive thinkers and no exclusive doers. Depending on the nature of our work and position we hold in the organization, we are required to focus more on one aspect of the work than on the other. Let us now proceed to the most important issue of translating vision into reality in the next chapter.</p>
