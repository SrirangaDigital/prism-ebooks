		<p><strong>Trans lating dreams into a reality</strong></p>
		<p>In chapter 3, we studied in depth about visuali zation -the constant dreaming and thinkin g of the goals which propel our action s . Visualization is similar to t h e job of an architect who makes dream giant, the engineer in us, to execute the plan. Let us again remember the success formula defined by Swami Vivekananda and the third sentence in this formula which is the highlighted topic of this chapter. “ Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life -- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. <strong>Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone.</strong> This is the way to success.”</p>
				<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/120.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Hence, the dreamer has to necessarily become a man of action to transform the dreams into reality; otherwise, the dreams remain as dreams forever. The engineer in the architect should take charge. The right side of the brain needs to drive the left side of the brain. Swami Vivekananda serves as a great role model in this action- oriented plan. He is not only a man of action but also adept in converting a sheep into a lioness and drives it into action. “Work, Work, Let this be your motive!” is the slogan of Swami Vivekananda and he aroused the sleeping nation with his <em>'Karma Yoga'</em> principles.</p>
		<p>Before plunging into the focus on execution of the work, let us take a look at some of the things that prevent us from moving forward with the work. A beginner has to overcome these hurdles. Subsequently, we can look at other details that will be helpful to persons who are already men of action.</p>
		<ol class="roman">
			<li>The 'status quo' attitude.</li> 
			<li>The attitude of running in the old grooves of habits.</li>
			<li>The penchant attitude.</li> 
			<li>The procrastination attitude.</li>
			<li>The educated illiterate's attitude.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let us now analyze these attitudes which prevent people from working!</p>
		<p><strong>i)The 'status quo' attitude</strong></p>
		<p>Everybody has certain habits formed in him and these are steering his life-style. If excellence is to be achieved, another set of habits -which may be exactly opposite to the present one -needs to replace these old habits. This implies incessant physical as well as mental hard work. Many people will be easily convinced to change their lives by changing their thoughts. But while implementing and translating these thoughts into the action, many will back out saying, “ This is not our cup of tea”. Old habits are too hard to be replaced by new ones. They do not want to take the trouble but prefer to maintain the 'status quo'. If one wants to attain excellence, one must shed this trait of being content with the 'status quo'.</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda's advice to 'status quo' people</strong></p>
		<p>The 'status quo' people have imprisoned themselves in many limitations. This inspiring message of Swami Vivekananda will do a world of good to such people who withdraw into their little shell and maintain their status quo. Delivering a lecture on 'one existence appearing as many' in New York (1896), Swami Vivekananda said: “You are the creator of the universe. Like the silkworm you have built a cocoon around yourself. Who will save you? Burst your own cocoon and come out as the beautiful butterfly, as the free soul. Then alone you will see Truth. Ever tell yourself, 'I am He (God)'. These are the words that will burn up the dross that is in the mind, words that will bring out the tremendous energy which is within you already, the infinite power which is sleeping in your heart.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">

		</figure>
		<p><strong>The 'status quo' man who refused to get released from jail</strong></p>
		<p>There was a prisoner who was jailed for a very long term and this man was made to live in the dark room of a jail for several decades. After completing his sentence in jail, he was released. The jail wardens thought he would happily leave the jail and start living a decent life. But as this man came out of the jail's main gate, he felt very uncomfortable to face the broad daylight. He immediately requested the jail authorities to take him back into the jail and help him by putting him back into the dark room, away from the brightness of the day light. Many people unknowingly follow the same principle of this man and refuse to face the challenges of life to attain excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Stand up and fight. Not one step back, that is the idea. Fight it out whatever comes.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>ii) Running in the old grooves of habits</strong></p>
		<p>The journey of excellence is like mountaineering. One has to face several problems. One major hurdle in the journey to excellence is falling back into the old grooves of habits. Let us look at a story that has often been narrated by Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa to highlight the influence of habits on our lives.</p>
		<p><strong>The fisherwoman who could not sleep amidst the smell of flowers</strong></p>
		<p>There were two women who were close friends. One was a fisherwoman trading in fish and the other sold flowers. One day, the fisherwoman got delayed till late in the night and she preferred to stay in her flower-seller friend's house as it was nearby.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/127.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>She came there with her empty basket after selling the fish in the market and was invited to sleep in the room where the flowers were stored. But she could not get sleep for a long time because of the fragrance of the flowers. Her hostess saw her sleepless condition and said, “Hello! Why are you tossing from side to side restlessly?” The fisherwoman replied, “I don't know, dear friend. Perhaps the fragrance of the flowers has been disturbing my sleep. Can you give the fish basket to me? Perhaps that will put me to sleep.” The basket was brought to her. She sprinkled water on it to make the smell of the fish emanate from the basket and put it near her nose. She fell into a sound sleep and snored all through the night inhaling the smell of the fish basket!</p>
		<p><strong>iii) The penchant attitude</strong></p>
		<p>These people have great ideas and dream of them very well. But they neither leave them nor follow them. They always proclaim their ideas to everyone and try to get recognition from others for their plans. When it comes to implementation, they balk at it. These people need managerial skills and improvement in their inter-relationship skills to deal with different kinds of people and complicated situations to taste success.</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda's advice to penchant people</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda's inspiring message can do a world of good to these 'show-off' people. He advises them thus: “Let us be true. Nine-tenths of our life's energy is spent in trying to make people think us that which we are not. That energy would be more rightly spent in becoming that which we would like to be.”</p>
		<p>Now let us look at one incident from the life of Swami Vivekananda which drives his brother-disciples from the penchant mode into the rigorous action mode:</p>
		<p><strong>a)Let those who have come for child's play be off now</strong></p>
		<p>In a letter written from U.S.A., Swami Vivekananda drove his brother -disciples into action mode with these words: “It won't do merely to call Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation, you must manifest power. Where are Gour-ma, Yogin-ma, and Golap -ma? Tell them to spread these ideas. We want thousands of men and thousands of women who will spread like wildfire from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, from the North Pole to the South Pole -- all over the world. It is no use indulging in child's play --neither is there time for it. Let those who have come for child's play be off now, while there is time, or they will surely come to grief. We want an organisation. Off with laziness. Spread! Spread! Run like fire to all places. Do not depend upon me. Whether I live or die, go on spreading, yourselves.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/128.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>		
		<p><strong>b) Do not talk; work, work, work!</strong></p>
		<p>While driving Narasimhachariyar, his disciple, into the action mode , Swami Vivekananda wrote 'Now, do not talk; work, work, work! I do not see anything permanent you have done in India -- I do not see any centre you have made --I do not see any temple or hall you have erected --I do not see anybody joining hands with you. There is too much talk, talk, talk! We are great, we are great! Nonsense! We are imbeciles; that is what we are! This hankering after name and fame and all other humbugs --what are they to me? What do I care about them? I should like to see hundreds coming to the Lord! Where are they? I want them, I want to see them. You must seek them out. Plunge into the fire and bring the people towards the Lord. That you may catch my fire, that you may be intensely sincere, that you may die the heroes' death on the field of battle --is the constant prayer of -Vivekananda”</p>
				<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/129.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>iv) The procrastination attitude</strong></p>
		<p>People with procrastination attitude are experts in delaying things. If we enquire about the progress, they have many ready-made answers like, “I am analyzing things.”; “Give me some time to think about it.”; “Conditions are not favourable at this juncture.” There is no end to their professionally-structured answers and well-rehearsed excuses. The fundamental reason behind procrastination is the gap between the abilities required and the abilities they have. Instead of filling up the gap through guidance from experts, they develop the fear of failure. Their daily schedule is full of the least important things. The only thing they need to do is replace this daily unimportant agenda with high priority work and dare to attempt to do this work by taking guidance from experts, wherever required.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/130.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda's advice to procrastinating people</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda's advice to procrastinating type people is, “Set yourselves to work -- to work! Do not tarry -- the time of death is approaching day by day! Do not sit idle, thinking that everything will be done in time, later on! Mind -- nothing will be done that way!”</p>
		<p>While giving lectures on Karma Yoga in Western countries, quoting one of the incidents from his life, Swami Vivekananda said: “I once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a very stupid, dull person, who knew nothing and had not the desire to know anything, and was living the life of a brute. He asked me what he should do to know God, how he was to get free. 'Can you tell a lie?' I asked him. 'No,' he replied. 'Then you must learn to do so. It is better to tell a lie than to be a brute, or a log of wood. You are inactive; you have not certainly reached the highest state, which is beyond all actions, calm and serene; you are too dull even to do something wicked.' That was an extreme case, of course, and I was joking with him; but what I meant was that a man must be active in order to pass through activity to perfect calmness.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/131.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Let us now look at a few incidents from the life of Swami Vivekananda to understand how he drove one of his brother disciples to shift gear from the procrastinating mode to the intensive action mode. <strong>Six long months of brooding over the questions of honour and disgrace, gain and loss pertaining to this?</strong></p>
		<p>Let us look at another letter written by Swami Vivekananda wherein he wrote to his brother -disciple Swami Brahmananda - pushing him into action, ' Should one spend six long months brooding over the questions of honour and disgrace, gain and loss pertaining to this? . . . I am a man of action. Simply advice upon advice is being given -- this one says this, that one says that; again that man threatens, and this one frightens! This life is not, in my view, such a sweet thing that I would long to live through so much care and caution and fear.'</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/132.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>		
		<p><strong>v)The educated illiterate's attitude</strong></p>
		<p>There are some illiterate people who cannot read and they may not be able to progress on the journey of attaining excellence in the material world. But there are those who have read several books and became repositories of knowledge. They, however, do not use their knowledge to practical ends. What is the difference between a person who cannot read and a person who can read but never uses it for practical purposes? The purpose of acquiring knowledge is to use it for the benefit of the individual as well as to the society.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/133.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>A doctor, an engineer, a marketing person, a chartered accountant, an industrialist or any other professional spends several years at colleges, institutions and universities to learn their respective subjects. Over a period of decades in his chosen profession, a person learns many things and by the time he attains 50+ years of age, he becomes a repository of knowledge. But what is the use of knowledge and experience when they are not used for practical purposes for the benefit of society? A DVD disc costs Rs12/- and can hold 4.7 G.B data, i.e. information equal to the data contained in a library. If person has vast knowledge but does not use it, the value of his whole knowledge is just Rs12/-(cost of DVD) because his brain is simply acting like a storage device to hold all the information.</p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda says, “ The training by which the current and expression of will are brought under control and become fruitful is called education….Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested all your life. We must have life-building, man-making, character-making assimilation of ideas. If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library.”</p>
		<p>There are many knowledgeable people who take the back-seat once they retire under the garb of senior citizens, and many of them prefer a peaceful life full of rest. But life should start after retirement as he has discharged all responsibilities and can take courageous decisions without playing a safe, conservative role. He has rich experience and knowledge, and this should be put to the right use for the benefit of society. All of us are aware of One Day International (ODI) cricket matches. In the initial 35 overs, the players bat cautiously to retain the wickets and try to get as many runs as possible and in the last 15 overs, they slam sixers and boundaries as saving wickets serves no purpose and adding runs is the need of the hour. The elderly people should follow the policy of the last overs strategy of ODI's'. As their lives are nearing the end, they should use their knowledge for the welfare of society which they could not do in the early period of their lives due to personal constraints.</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda's advice to educated illiterates</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda's inspiring message to these people is: “You have to be practical in all spheres of work. The whole country has been ruined by masses of theories…. If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library.”</p>
		<p>Let us look at a few incidents from the life of Swami Vivekananda which inspire us to take up Herculean tasks.</p>
		<p><strong>a) If one has got power, one must show it in action</strong></p>
		<p>Let us see how Swami Vivekananda inspires educated and knowledgeable persons to translate their knowledge into action. In one of his letters, Swami Vivekananda wrote to Swami Brahmananda: “Well, I cannot tell you all -- if I could but get another demon like me! The Lord will supply me everything in time. . . . If one has got power, one must manifest it in action. . . .Off with your ideas of Mukti and Bhakti! There is only one way in the world, 'The good live for others alone', 'The wise man should sacrifice himself for others'. I can secure my own good only by doing you good. There is no other way, none whatsoever. . . . You are God, I am God, and man is God. It is this God manifested through humanity who is doing everything in this world. Is there a different God sitting high up somewhere? To work, therefore!”</p>

			<img src="images/134.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>b)Useless bandying of words and making noise is taking away our time; it is consuming our life energy</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda wrote to his brother, disciple Swami Akhandananda : “ What fear! Opportunity, remedy, and its application will present themselves. I do not care about the result, well or ill. I shall be happy if only you do this much of work. Wordy warfares, texts and scriptures, doctrines and dogmas -- all these I am coming to loathe as poison in this my advanced age. Know this for certain that he who will work will be the crown on my head. Useless bandying of words and making noise is taking away our time, is consuming our life-energy, without pushing the cause of humanitarianism a step further. -- away with fear! Bravo! There is a hero indeed! May the blessed Guru be enthroned in your heart, and the Divine Mother guide your hands.”</p>
		<p>Take the whole responsibility on your shoulders, and know thatyou are the creator of your own destiny. All the strength andsuccor you want is within yourself.</p>

		<p><strong>Let us now turn our attention to positive habits that make us a man of action</strong></p>
		<p>In the above paragraphs, we took a peep at some negative qualities that hinder our progress on the journey of excellence and learnt how to counteract them. We now turn our attention to positive ways of focusing on work.</p>
		<ol class="roman">
			<li>Bubbling with energy and enthusiasm!</li> 
			<li>Seeing opportunities in problems!</li> 
			<li>Stand up and fight; Not take one step back!</li>
			<li>Do work as worship.</li>
			<li>Have faith in yourselves first and then in God.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let us now analyze each positive way to work!</p>
		<p><strong>i)Bubbling with energy and enthusiasm!</strong></p>
		<p>One of the fundamental quality of a man of action is to be bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Everybody likes such a person. These persons can achieve great things in their lives. Give some additional work to a man bubbling with energy and enthusiasm who is already burdened with one hundred other works, he will do it immediately. Give the same work to a lazy man who has no work -he will never do it.</p>
		<p>Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa used to cite an example of active persons. In the villages, the farmers go to the market/fair on Sundays to buy things. Those who want to sell their bulls line them up in the mela (market/ fair). No farmer can afford to buy an inert bull and once a bull is purchased, it cannot be returned or exchanged. So the farmers conduct some litmus tests to determine whether a bull is active or not. They twist the tail of the sitting bull and it immediately gets up and stands erect if it is active in nature. An inactive bull never reacts when its tail is twisted and comfortably sits in its position with the appearance of unconcern. No farmer can afford to buy such a bull as he can never manage to get his work done by it.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/140.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Referring to the active nature of Swami Vivekananda, his guru -Sri Ramakrishna -commented, “Narendra is not under the control of anything. He is like the male pigeon. If you hold a male pigeon by its beak, it breaks away from you; but a female pigeon keeps still. I feel a great strength when Narendra is with me in a gathering.”</p>
		<p><strong>Heroism is soul in action!</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda said heroism is the soul of action. He wanted to see the Ultimate Truth in all its terrible nakedness. He said the vilest crime is to sit idle and not doing anything. He asserted, “The older I grow, the more everything seems to me lie in manliness. This is my new Gospel. Do even evil like a man! Be wicked, if you must, on a grand scale!” Once Sister Nivedita (a disciple whom Swami Vivekananda treated as his daughter -disciple ) had complimented India on the insignificant rate of crime; on that occasion, Swami Vivekananda replied in sorrowful protest, “ Would to God it were otherwise, in my land! For this is verily the virtuousness of death.”</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/141.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>ii) Seeing opportunities in problems!</strong></p>
		<p>Work-oriented persons see opportunities in problems, while those who want to avoid work see problems in all opportunities. A person who constantly dreams of his objectives will always grab all opportunities that come his way and never see problems that are interlaced with it. Referring to the abilities of Americans to seize opportunities for growth, Swami Vivekananda wrote to Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya in a letter: “The men here are very clever in earning wealth. Where others do not see even dust, there they see gold.”</p>
		<p><strong>Develop the attitude of people working in gold and diamond mines</strong></p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/142.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>While digging in the gold mines to unearth one ounce of gold, tons of dirt has to be removed from the ore. The people involved in mining operations to extract gold do not notice the dirt at all and their minds see only gold. Similarly, a person who wants to achieve his goals should look at the various opportunities available and not the problems associated with the goals. There cannot be any opportunities without any problems. The proverb says, 'No risks- No gain.'</p>
		<p>Similarly in diamond mines, to extract a small piece of diamond, the miners have to remove tons of dirt. Their minds do not see the dirt while digging and they only look out for diamonds.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/143.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Hence, a person who dreamt of an idea constantly and wants to achieve it will always see only the opportunities available in different situations, and his mind never bothers about a few hardships that are to be encountered while encashing those opportunities. He is a staunch believer of the proverb 'No pains- No gains.'</p>
		<p><strong>The story of a fascinated man, Vilvamangla</strong></p>
		<p><span>During his discourses in Western countries, Swami Vivekananda narrated a story from 'Bhaktamala' which highlights how a man driven by his desires moves forward. Let us look at it in the words of Swami Vivekananda: “There was a young man, a Brahmin by birth, in a certain village. The man fell in love with a bad woman in another village. There was a big river between the two villages, and this man, every day, used to go to that girl, crossing this river in a ferry boat. Now, one day he had to perform the obsequies of his father, and so, although he was longing, almost dying to go to the girl, he could not. The ceremonies had to be performed, and all those things had to be undergone; it is absolutely necessary in Hindu society. He was fretting and fuming and all that, but could not help it. At last the ceremony ended, and night came, and with the night, a tremendous howling storm arose. The rain was pouring down, and the river was lashed into gigantic waves. It was very dangerous to cross. Yet he went to the bank of the river. There was no ferry boat. The ferrymen were afraid to cross, but he would go; his heart was becoming mad with love for the girl, so he would go. There was a log floating down, and he got that, and with the help of it, crossed the river, and getting to the other side dragged the log up, threw it on the bank, and went to the house. The doors were closed. He knocked at the door, but the wind was howling, and nobody heard him. So he went round the walls and at last found what he thought to be a rope, hanging from the wall. He clutched at it, saying to himself, 'Oh, my love has left a rope for </span>me to climb.' By the help of that rope he climbed over the wall, got to the other side, missed his footing, and fell, and the noise aroused the inmates of the house, and the girl came out and found the man there in a faint. She revived him, and noticing that he was smelling very unpleasantly, she said, 'What is the matter with you? Why this stench on your body? How did you come into the house? How did you cross the river?' 'Why, I got hold of a log of wood.' 'Let us go and see,' said the girl. The rope was a cobra, a tremendously poisonous serpent, whose least touch is death. It had its head in a hole, and was getting in when the man caught hold of its tail, and he thought it was a rope. The madness of love made him do it. When the serpent has its head in its hole, and its body out, and you catch hold of it, it will not let its head come out; so the man climbed up by it, but the force of the pull killed the serpent. 'Where did you get the log?' 'It was floating down the river.' It was a festering dead body; the stream had washed it down and that he took for a log, which explained why he had such an unpleasant odour. ”</p>
		<p><strong>iii) Stand up and fight; Not take one step back!</strong></p>
		<p>A new venture or a dream work is always fascinating and everybody can make a beginning very easily. But if we expect that achieving our cherished goal is a path of roses and all incidents will be sweet and nice, we are gravely mistaken. In this context we need to remember the words of Swami Vivekananda: “If there is a way to Heaven, it must be passing through Hell.” Hence, we have to necessarily pass through Hell to achieve our cherished goals. It is natural for many people to give up the goal when they face serious difficulties. But a man who has got the raging inner fire to achieve the goal will never give up.</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda's inspiring message a)Fight it out whatever comes</strong></p>
		<p>While delivering a lecture on Bhagawad Gita, Swami Vivekananda said, “ Knowing this, stand up and fight! Not one step back, that is the idea. ...Fight it out, whatever comes. Let the stars move from the sphere! Let the whole world stand against us! Death means only a change of garment. What of it? Thus fight! You gain nothing by becoming cowards. ...Taking a step backward, you do not avoid any misfortune. You have cried to all the Gods in the world. Has misery ceased? The masses in India cry to sixty million gods, and still die like dogs.”</p>

		<p><strong>b) A true spirit of fighting out all the odds in life</strong></p>
		<p>We can get inkling on how to fight out all the troubles in life by looking at one of the letters written by Swami Vivekananda to his brother disciple Swami Bhrahmananda, “But I have all along been like a hero -- I want my work to be quick like lightning, and firm as adamant. Likewise shall I die also. Therefore kindly do my work for me -- no question of success or defeat enters here at all. I have never retreated in a fight -- shall I now . . . ? There is success and failure in every work. But I am inclined to believe that one who is a coward will be born after death as an insect or a worm, that there is no salvation for a coward even after millions of years of penance. Well, shall I after all be born as a worm? . . . In my eyes this world is mere play -- and it will always remain as such… So loss of money, or loss of anything else -- I cannot bother about, and I will not. When I fight, I fight with girded loins -- that much I fully understand; and I also understand that man, that hero, that god, who says, 'Don't care, be fearless. O brave one, here I am by your side!' To such a man -god I offer a million salutations. ”</p>
		<p><strong>Men of action!<br /> Alexander – Stand up and fight; Not take one step back</strong></p>
		<p>If we study the lives of the world's renowned people, we can readily see the fundamental factor behind their success is their inherent quality of standing up and fighting all the issues that crop up in their way and never step back. Let us look at the qualities of Alexander of Macedonia even though 'stand up and fight' is not merely for fighting battles but is more related to facing stumbling blocks in the path of achieving our goal. The strategies of Alexander and his leadership style is today widely applied by management experts to develop strategies in the battlefield of the market place for the expansion and growth of their companies.</p>
		<p>Alexander (356 B.C) earned the title of 'Alexander the Great' by virtue of his heroic qualities. The most important factor behind his success is the person who taught him basic principles. Alexander quotes, “I am indebted to my father for living, but to my teacher for living well.” Look at the lineage of knowledge flow to Alexander. The great philosopher Socrates taught his dearest disciple Plato. The flow of knowledge passed from Plato to his pupil, Aristotle. When he, Alexander, was 13 years old, his father Philip availed himself of the services of Aristotle to sharpen the intellectual faculties of Alexander. Aristotle gave Alexander an extensive three years training in rhetoric and literature, and stimulated his interest in science, medicine, and philosophy - all of which became of importance in his later life. Over-powered by egoism due to his successes, Alexander sometimes deviated from the principles taught by his guru but he always carried the written teachings of Aristotle with him and referred to them frequently. He applied the principles taught by Aristotle widely in his strategies, and his steadfast following of those principles brought him success and glory.</p>
		<p>Take courage and work on. Patience and steady work- this is the only way. Go on; remember- patience and purity and courage and steady work.</p>

		<p><strong>The success story of Alexander the Great</strong></p>
		<p>At the age of 16, Alexander was given the power to rule by his father and he proved his capability by swiftly defeating the Thracian tribe of Maedi and renaming their stronghold as Alexandripolis. At the age of 20, Alexander lost his father and taking this opportunity, the earlier conquered rulers -the Illyrians, Thracians and Greeks -rebelled to gain back their independence. But Alexander acted with amazing speed. The courageous Alexander, with his intellectual abilities sharpened by Aristotle, was more than capable to regain control of his kingdom.</p>
		<p>After bringing the territories back to Macedonian control, the 22 year old Alexander plunged into his next move of invading Asia. He encountered King Darius III of Persia at river Granicus. Alexander won the battle and marched forward into Asia Minor conquering the coast of Asia Minor (a peninsula of Western Asia between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea) and then successfully captured central Asia Minor.</p>
		<p>When Alexander reached 23 years of age (333 BC), he encountered the Persian forces under the command of King Darius III at a mountain pass at Issus, in north-western Syria. Alexander's soldiers were far less in number as compared to that of Darius's army. But Alexander put up a brave face and raised the morale of his army. He lead the army by positioning himself in the front and guided his army to victory. King Darius fled in panic before the Macedonian phalanx, abandoning his mother, wife, two teenage daughters and a young son. Alexander treated them with the respect out of consideration for their royalty and never took any advantage of their captivity. He applied the principles taught by his teacher Aristotle in this case wisely and reaped rich dividends. While he honoured and respected the mother and wife of Darius, he also later married a daughter of King Darius as a symbol of unity between the long warring nations of Greece and Persia.</p>
		<p>At the age of 25 years, Alexander marched into Egypt. The Persian army surrendered and the Macedonians were welcomed by the Egyptians as liberators for they had despised living under Persian rule for almost two centuries.</p>
		<p>Alexander enlarged his army with additional soldiers from Europe and headed towards Babylon and on the way conquered lands between the Tigris and the Euphrates and finally reached the plains of Gaugamela in Iraq. The Macedonian army sought the permission of Alexander to attack the Persian camps by taking advantage of darkness at night. But Alexander set aside their proposal as he wanted to defeat Darius in a manly way so that he would not dare to rise against him again. Accordingly, both armies encountered each other the next day in the morning. Alexander's cavalry directly attacked King Darius and he fled once again as he had done at Issus. Alexander captured Babylon.</p>
		<p>At the age of 29 years, Alexander marched into India by invading Punjab and attacking King Porus who was one of the most powerful rulers of India. It was not an easy task for Alexander to face the thunderstorm of the army of King Porus who were armed with elephants and used methods of warfare unknown to Alexander's army. But the Indians were defeated in the ensuing battle.</p>
		<p><strong>One soul manifesting itself as Alexander, Genghis Khan and Napoleon in three different conquests!</strong></p>
		<p>We can see from the life of Alexander that he had a great passion to conquer the world. He constantly dreamt of it and that tremendous passion drove him to incessant action. When a passionate soul fails in achieving its goal in one life, its tendencies/qualities are taken forward in the form of a causal body from birth to birth and will once again strive to achieve its goal in the next birth. Alexander (356 B.C – 323 B.C) made incessant efforts to conquer the whole world and failed; Genghis Khan (1162-1227 A.D) made incessant efforts to conquer the world and failed; Napoleon (1769-1821 A.D) made incessant efforts to conquer the world and failed.</p>
		<p>Once Swami Vivekananda was talking about Genghis Khan, the conqueror from Central Asia and said, “You hear people talk of him as a vulgar aggressor- he cried passionately, but that is not true! They are never greedy or vulgar, these great souls! He was inspired with the thought of unity, and he wanted to unify his world. Yes, Napoleon was cast in the same mould. And another, Alexander. Only those three, or perhaps one soul manifesting itself in three different conquests!" Then he went on to speak of that one soul whom he believed had come again and again in religion, charged with the divine impulse to bring about the unity of man in God.</p>

		<p><strong>iv) Do work as worship</strong></p>
		<p>The famous proverb says, “Work is worship.” Swami Vivekananda says, “Let the end and the means be joined into one." When you are doing any work, do not think of anything beyond it. Do it as worship, as the highest mode of worship, and devote your whole life to it for the time being. …</p>
		<p>Whenever failure comes, if we analyze it critically, in ninety-nine per cent of the cases we shall find that it was because we did not pay attention to the means of achieving the end goal. Proper attention to the finishing (strengthening) of the means is what we need. With the right means, the end must come. We forget that it is the cause that produces the effect; the effect cannot come by itself; unless the causes are exact, proper and powerful, the effect will not be produced. Once the ideal is chosen and the means determined, we may almost let go off the ideal because we are sure it will be there when the means are perfected. When the cause is there, there is no more difficulty about the effect as the effect is bound to come. If we take care of the cause, the effect will take care of itself. The realization of the ideal is the effect. The means are the cause: attention to the means, therefore, is the great secret of life.”</p>

		<p><strong>a) The story of Dharma Vyadha</strong></p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda explains the story of Dharma Vyadha, emphasizing how he did his duty with cheerfulness and whole–heartedness, and became illumined. Hence, the right performance of the duties of any station in life, without anticipating results, leads us to excellence. Let us look at the story as described by swami Vivekananda.</p>
		<p>A young Sannyasin seeking divine knowledge was advised by a pious woman to meet Dharma Vyadha who was a butcher and made his living by selling meat. The Sannyasin went to meet Dharma Vyadha, and at that time, he was slicing meat with his knives, talking to and bargaining with different people. The Sannyasin said to himself, 'Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going to learn? He is the incarnation of a demon, if he is anything." In the meantime Dharma Vyadha looked up and said, "O Sannyasin! Did that lady send you here? Take a seat until I have done my business." The Sannyasin thought, "What comes to me here?" He took his seat; the man went on with his work, and after he had finished his work, he took his money and said to the Sannyasin, "Come sir, come to my home." On reaching home the Vyadha gave him a seat, saying, "Wait here," and went into the house. He then washed the feet of his elderly father and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them, after which he came to the Sannyasin and said, "Now, sir, you have come here <span>to see me; what can I do for you?" The Sannyasin asked him a few questions about soul and about God, and Dharma Vyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the <em>'Mahabharata',</em> called the <em>'Vyadha-Gita'.</em> It contains one of the highest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his teaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, "Why are you in that body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a Vyadha's body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?" "My son," replied Dharma Vyadha, "no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth placed me in these circumstances and environments. In my boyhood I learnt the trade; I am unattached, and I try to do my duty well. I try to do my duty as a householder, and I try to do all I can to make my father and mother happy. I neither know your Yoga, nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of the world into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen has come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which belongs to my position." </span></p>
		<p><strong>b) I am poor and I love poor people</strong></p>
		<p>Achieving our goal depends on our commitment towards it and doing it as a worship. We can get clear insights into this aspect from a letter written by Swami Vivekananda to one of his disciples in Madras: “ I always pray for you: you must pray for me. Let each one of us pray day and night for the down-trodden millions in India who are held fast by poverty, priestcraft, and tyranny -- pray day and night for them. I care more to preach religion to them than to the high and the rich. I am no metaphysician, no philosopher, nay, no saint. But I am poor, I love the poor. I see what they call the poor of this country, and how many there are who feel for them! What an immense difference in India! Who feels there for the two hundred millions of men and women sunken forever in poverty and ignorance? Where is the way out? Who feels for them? They cannot find light or education. Who will bring the light to them -- who will travel from door to door bringing education to them? Let these people be your God --think of them, work for them, pray for them incessantly --the Lord will show you the way. Him I call a Mahatman (great soul) whose heart bleeds for the poor, otherwise he is a Duratman (wicked soul). Let us unite our wills in continued prayer for their good. We may die unknown, unpitied, unbewailed, without accomplishing anything -- but not one thought will be lost. It will take effect, sooner or later. My heart is too full to express my feeling; you know it, you can imagine it. So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor who, having been educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them! I call those men who strut about in their finery, having got all their money by grinding the poor, wretches, so long as they do not do anything for those two hundred millions who are now no better than hungry savages! We are poor, my brothers, we are nobodies, but such have been always the instruments of the Most High. The Lord bless you all.”</p>
		<p><strong>v) Have faith in yourselves first and then in God</strong></p>
		<p>It is very good to have faith in God. But Swami Vivekananda has said that we should have faith in ourselves first and then in God. He advocated that faith in oneself is far more important than faith in God and a man of faith can achieve anything and everything. Swami Vivekananda asserted that the history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves.</p>
		<p>His bold message of faith in oneself is, “Let people say whatever they like, stick to your own convictions, and rest assured, the world will be at your feet. They say, ‘Have faith in this fellow or that fellow’, but I say, ‘Have faith in yourself first’, that's the way. Have faith in yourself — all power is in you— be conscious and bring it out. Say, ‘I can do everything.’ Even the poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it.”</p>
		<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda: Faith, sympathy -- fiery faith and fiery sympathy!</strong></p>
		<p>We can get insights into the importance of faith in oneself from reading one of the letters written by Swami Vivekananda to one of his disciples in Madras: “I may die here unsuccessful, another will take up the task. You know the disease, you know the remedy, only have faith. Do not look up to the so-called rich and great; do not care for the heartless intellectual writers and their cold-blooded newspaper articles. Faith, sympathy --fiery faith and fiery sympathy! Life is nothing, death is nothing, hunger nothing, cold nothing. Glory unto the Lord -- march on, the Lord is our General. Do not look back to see who falls -- forward -- onward! Thus and thus we shall go on, brethren. One falls, and another takes up the work.”</p>
		<p><strong>Let’s do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>In this chapter we have seen translation of visions/dreams into a reality. We have seen five negative qualities that prevent us from achieving our goals -viz. maintaining the ‘status quo’, running in the grooves of old habits, penchant attitude, procrastination and educated illiterate attitude. We have also seen five positive qualities that help us achieve the goals - viz. bubbling with energy and enthusiasm, seeing opportunities in problems, standing up and fighting without stepping back, having faith in oneself first and then faith in God.</p>
