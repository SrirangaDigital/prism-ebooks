		<p>In the previous chapters we saw that we get whatever we want from the infinite pure consciousness which is formless and beyond attributes. We saw the way to success as defined by Swami Vivekananda: “ Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life -- think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.” We attain the qualities of excellence by this method. It is needless to point out that sharing the wealth with the needy is expected of a man of character with qualities of excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Thank you God for all the help given to me!</strong></p>

		<p>Do we ever forget to say, “Thank you!” to the people from whom we receive help? We are taught from childhood to say, “Thank you!” for even the most trivial help we receive. How can we forget to say “Thank you!” to the infinite pure consciousness which is the fundamental factor behind our achievements? We achieved what we want by drawing energy from the formless pure consciousness by engraving our desires on it. It is essential that we should express our gratitude to the pure consciousness and offer back a portion of our wealth to needy people who are constantly praying to the infinite conscious for getting their needs fulfilled.</p>
		<p>We learnt that when we pray to pure consciousness for a particular achievement, it sends us various opportunities by saying, “Tathasthu – May it be so!” Persons who bring such opportunities to us are instruments in the hands of pure consciousness, whether consciously or unconsciously. But when such a thing is done consciously with gratitude, its effects bear fruits multiplied many times. Hence, having attained everything that we want by drawing energy from pure consciousness, it is our moral obligation to act as an instrument in its hands and provide opportunities to others who are constantly seeking help from pure consciousness.</p>

		<p><strong>Cycles of nature</strong></p>
		<p>As Albert Einstein says, “Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.” The <strong>law of conservation of energy</strong> states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant over time. Nature follows the principles of recycling and conserves energy.</p>
		<p>All of us know how the water cycle ensures continuity of water. A large amount of water evaporates from the surface of oceans, rivers and lakes every day and rises into the atmosphere. The vapour floats into the air and forms clouds and fog. When atmospheric conditions are right, the clouds release water in the form of rain. The rain water falls on the ground and into water bodies. Groundwater emerges from springs which once again enter rivers and finds its way back to the ocean, completing the water-cycle.</p>

		<p>Similarly, we have the carbon cycle, energy cycle and so on and so forth. We can also look into the aspect of birth and death. At the time of birth, our physical body is formed from five elements called Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether which are called <em>pancha mahabhutas</em> (five basic cosmic elements). When a person dies, his physical body decomposes and merges back into the five basic cosmic elements there by completing the cycle.</p>
		<p><strong>The wealth cycle</strong></p>
		<p>Similar to the way nature follows the cycles of water, energy, carbon etc., human beings have to necessarily follow the cycle of wealth. We receive wealth from pure consciousness following the principle of 'Tathashu- May it be so!' and we need to give back a portion of it to pure consciousness by way of sharing our wealth with the needy. Not sharing amassed wealth is a violation of natural laws and those individuals hoarding it for themselves, without sharing it with the needy, are bound to lose it soon. As per the sayings of Hindu scriptures, the law of recycling is applicable to sharing the wealth with the needy and wealth shared with the needy will come back to the person sharing it and that too will be multiplied many times. Many a time this is the driving principle behind charitable activities. But when such a sharing of wealth is done without expecting anything in return as a <em>nishkama karma</em> (action without seeking returns), such a person develops purity of mind and attains mukti (liberation).</p>

		<p><strong>The cycle is thus complete; what came from people has gone back to people many times over -J.R.D.Tata</strong></p>
		<p>Let us know look at the invaluable statement of J.R.D. Tata to understand the concept of completing the wealth cycle wherein he says, “ “The wealth gathered by Jamshedji Tata and his sons in half a century of industrial pioneering formed but a minute fraction of the amount by which they enriched the nation. The whole of that wealth is held in trust for the people and used exclusively for their benefit. The cycle is thus complete; what came from people has gone back to the people many times over.''</p>

		<p><strong>Lord Krishna advises Yudhishtira to share his wealth with the needy by Anna Dana</strong></p>
		<p>All of us are aware that the <em>Pandavas</em> won the famous <em>Kurukshetra</em> war under the guidance of Lord Krishna. But after winning the war, <em>Yudhishtira</em> was restless and deprived of peace of mind though his people had acquired the kingdom, huge wealth and power. The reason for his remorse was the killing of several thousands of people from the both sides, including their nearest and dearest ones. Lord Krishna was a great management expert. <em>Lord Krishna</em> advised the grief-stricken <em>Yudhisthira</em> to do <em>Anna Dana,</em> serving free food to all. The five Pandava brothers performed this ritual and gave very large gifts to the poor. All the people expressed amazement at the greatness and richness </span>of the free food and gifts served to one and all; an act the world had never seen before.</p>

		<p><strong>Insights into Karma Yoga principles highlighted by Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
		<p>Let us now look into the wonderful insights put forward by Swami Vivekananda through his teachings of Karma Yoga. We shall take up five excerpts from his lectures on Karma Yoga which will serve as guiding principles in sharing wealth with the needy.</p>
		<p><strong>a)By helping the world we help ourselves and not the world</strong></p>
		<p>Our duty to others means helping others; doing good to the world. Why should we do good to the world? Apparently to help the world, but really to help ourselves. We should always try to help the world, that should be the highest motive in us; but if we consider well, we find that the world does not require our help at all. This world was not made that you or I should come and help it. ..We cannot deny that there is much misery in it; to go out and help others is, therefore, the best thing we can do, although in the long run, we shall find that helping others is only helping ourselves.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/164.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>In the world take always the position of the giver; help, give service, give anything you can, but keep out barter.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/165.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>b) No beggar whom we have helped has ever owed a single cent to us; we owe everything to him</strong></p>
		<p>Yet we must do good; the desire to do good is the highest motive power we have, if we know all the time that it is a privilege to help others. Do not stand on a high pedestal and take five cents in your hand and say, "Here, my poor man," but be grateful that the poor man is there, so that by making a gift to him you are able to help yourself. It is not the receiver that is blessed, but it is the giver. Be thankful that you are allowed to exercise your power of benevolence and mercy in the world, and thus become pure and perfect. All good acts tend to make us pure and perfect. What can we do at best? Build a hospital, make roads, or erect charity asylums. We may organize a charity and collect two or three millions of dollars, build a hospital with one million, with the second give balls and drink champagne, and of the third let the officers steal half, and leave the rest finally to reach the poor; but what are all these? One mighty wind in five minutes can break all your buildings up. What shall we do then? One volcanic eruption may sweep away all our roads and hospitals and cities and buildings. Let us give up all this foolish talk of doing good to the world. It is not waiting for your or my help; yet we must work and constantly do good, because it is a blessing to ourselves. That is the only way we can become perfect. No beggar whom we have helped has ever owed a single cent to us; we owe everything to him, because he has allowed us to exercise our charity on him. It is entirely wrong to think that we have done, or can do, good to the world, or to think that we have helped such and such people. It is a foolish thought, and all foolish thoughts bring misery… If we were really unattached, we should escape all this pain of vain expectation, and could cheerfully do good work in the world.</p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/166.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>c) The world is like a dog's tail</strong></p>
		<p>This world is like a dog's curly tail, and people have been striving to straighten it out for hundreds of years; but when they let it go, it has curled up again. How could it be otherwise? One must first know how to work without attachment, then one will not be a fanatic. When we know that this world is like a dog's curly tail and will never get straightened, we shall not become fanatics. If there were no fanaticism in the world, it would make much more progress than it does now. It is a mistake to think that fanaticism can make for the progress of mankind. On the contrary, it is a retarding element creating hatred and anger, and causing people to fight each other, and making them unsympathetic. We think that whatever we do or possess is the best in the world, and what we do not do or possess is of no value. So, always remember the instance of the curly tail of the dog whenever you have a tendency to become a fanatic. You need not worry or make yourself sleepless about the world; it will go on without you. When you have avoided fanaticism, then alone will you work well. It is the level - headed man, the calm man, of good judgment and cool nerves, of great sympathy and love, who does good work and so does good to himself. The fanatic is foolish and has no sympathy; he can never straighten the world, nor himself become pure and perfect.</p>

		<p><strong>d) Do you ask anything from your children in return for what you have given them?</strong></p>
		<p>Do you ask anything from your children in return for what you have given them? It is your duty to work for them, and there the matter ends. In whatever you do for a particular person, a city, or a state, assume the same attitude towards it as you have towards your children --expect nothing in return. If you can invariably take the position of a giver, in which everything given by you is a free offering to the world, without any thought of return, then will your work bring you no attachment. Attachment comes only where we expect a return.</p>
		<p><strong>e) Consider work as worship</strong></p>
		<p>All thought of obtaining return for the work we do hinders our spiritual progress; nay, in the end it brings misery. There is another way in which this idea of mercy and selfless charity can be put into practice; that is, by looking upon work as "worship" in case we believe in a Personal God. Here we give up all the fruits of our work unto the Lord, and worshipping Him thus, we have no right to expect anything from mankind for the work we do. The Lord Himself works incessantly and is ever without attachment. Just as water cannot wet the lotus leaf, so work cannot bind the unselfish man by giving rise to attachment to results. The selfless and unattached man may live in the very heart of a crowded and sinful city; he will not be touched by sin.</p>
		<p><strong>Let's do a recap!</strong></p>
		<p>Similar to the way nature follows cycles of water, energy, carbon and other cycles, human beings too have to necessarily follow the cycle of wealth. Wealth shared with the needy will come back to the person sharing it and that too gets multiplied many times. But when such a sharing of wealth is done without expecting anything in return - as a <em>nishkama karma</em> (action without seeking returns) -such a person develops purity of mind and attains mukti (liberation).</p>
