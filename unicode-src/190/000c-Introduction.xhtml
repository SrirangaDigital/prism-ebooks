		<p>DVG's <strong>Samskriti (Culture)</strong> is a comprehensive but condensed analysis of the complex concept of culture. It is written in an epigrammatic, Baconian style. He accepts the Arnolosian definition of Culture that it is the sum and substance of the best that has been thought and solid in the world. With his legendary erudition, DVG inxtaposes Western thinkers like Shakespeare, Mathew Arnold, John Henry Cardinal Newman and Emerson with the opinions of Eastern savants like Valmiki, Manu, Bhasa and Bhartrihari and gives examples from characters like Sri Rama, Bharata, Arjuna and Anjaneya to present his concept of culture. At the same time, he defines culture thus– ‘‘If an object in nature is beautified by the discrimination of man, it is culture.’’ He gives several examples. ‘‘The marble is nature. The statue carved out of it by a sculptor is culture.’’ Culture is not confined merely to a pleasing apprearance and beautiful speech. That is external culture. Superior to that is inner, innate culture. Indeed, a study of DVG's work, CULTURE is itself an act of Culture</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>DVG</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Gundappa</strong>, popularly known as DVG was more a phenomenon than an individual. There is a saying in English – “<em>Some write books on history, but some others create history</em>”. DVG belonged to the latter category. Born in a Tamil family on 17th March, 1887 in a predominantly Telugu region - Mulabagal in Kolar District of Karnataka – he was a very great scholar in Sanskrit and English. There is a saying in Kannada that there is no leaf which the goat does not touch. There is no subject on which DVG has not written. It is said about Oliver Goldsmith that there was nothing he touched which he did not adorn. DVG’s works are innumerable to be even mentioned in a short note like this. However, just a few must be mentioned to understand the stature of this intellectual giant. He has written five biographies, among them two on Vidyaranya (1983), eight Memoirs, among them one on Artists (1970), one on Literature creators (1970), one on the Dewans of Mysore (1971) and one on Vaidic traditionalists (1972), two works on Children’s literature, four works on non-fiction prose among which the present volume – SAMSKRITI is one (1953, 1956, 1969,1987). His interest in Drama and Theatre resulted in the writing seven plays, among them the translation of Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth </em>(1936, 1974). His works on religion are a special category by themselves – <em>Purusha Sukta </em>(1953, 1971), <em>Isopanishat </em>(1953, 1970) <em>Bhagavadgita Tatparya </em>(1966, 1971), <em>God </em>(1973) and <em>Rita, Satya, Dharma </em>(1975). He has to his credit fifteen collections of poems, among them <em>Nivedana </em>(1924, 1933, 1956), <em>Vidyaranya Stuti </em>(1924) <em>Antahpura Gite </em>(1950, 1953), <em>Valmiki Vyasa Vandanam </em>(1951), <em>Gita Shakuntalam </em>(1960, 1961) etc. However, two of his very special works are <em>Manku Thimmana Kagga &#38; Marula Muniyana Kagga. </em>Many scholars think that his <em>Manku Thimmana Kagga </em>which has seen many editions (1943, 1950, 1958, 1964, 1969, 1987 et al) is his <strong>magnum opus. </strong>However, it is his most popular work and there are many who can recite it from the beginning to the end as they do the <em>Bhagavadgita</em>. There are as many as twenty scholarly works of comment and criticism on it. The English translations of <em>Mankuthimmana Kagga </em>by Sri. D. Seshagiri Rao and Sri. A. Narasimha Bhat who have also translated DVG’s <em>Marula Muniyana Kagga </em>and the six Audio Cassettes by Swami Brahmananda must be specially mentioned. The best Kannada critics have written books and articles on DVG Among them, Professor L.S. Seshagiri Rao, C.N. Mangala, T.N. Padmanabhan,</p>
		<p>G.S. Chakravarthi, P. Balakrishna Rao and G.P. Rajarathnam. A special mention must be made of Shatavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh who is an authority on DVG and he has made a special study of the metrical experiments in DVG’s poetry. It may not out of place to mention here that DVG was quite a “Personality”. A very impressive figure, a wonderful and witty conversationalist, a dominating “presence” in any company, a lover of life with great zest and zeal, he gave assurance of a complete man. The tradition he belonged to – the great scholar Govinda Pai, the translation pioneer B.M. Srikantaiah, the students’ pet T.S. Venkannaiah, A.R. Krishna Sastry of Prabuddha Karnataka, the charismatic orator C.K. Venkataramaiah and my own teacher, V. Sitaramaiah. It is with utmost humility, that I present my translation of the great DVG’s <strong>Samskriti.</strong></p>
