		<p>It is comparatively less difficult to translate from one Indian language into another as there is a common cultural core and code. But to translate from an Indian Language into English presents some special difficulties. The very structure of an uninflected language like modern English presents special problems of word-order and length of sentences. When the subject is culture-specific the task is really arduous especially when the text itself is about culture. DVG’s encyclopaedic knowledge and phenomenal erudition do not make things easy. His range of references indicate the scope of this treatise on culture- Amarakosha, Manudharma Sastra, the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgtia, Apastambha Sutra, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, Bhartihari, Bhavabhuti – to mention just a few sources. It is a task which requires knowledge of Sanskrit on the one hand and more than a nodding acquaintance with Indian metaphysics on the other. I was utterly humbled when Padmasri Dr. Mathur Krishnamurti, Director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan asked me to translate DVG’s <strong>Samskriti </strong>into English. I know I have not been able to vindicate his trust in my ability but I only hope that I have not completely betrayed that trust. I am greatful to my son Dr. S. Ranganath, Director, R.V. Institute of Sanskrit Studies for reading the proof.</p>
