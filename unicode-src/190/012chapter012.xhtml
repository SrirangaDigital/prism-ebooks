		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">The General and the Special</h1>
		<p><strong>T</strong>o the extent to which a man resembles another, both of them are equal. The aspects of this similarity is what is seemed “General” or “Common”.</p>
		<p>To the extent to which a man does not resemble another but is different, to that extent of them are “special”. The marks of separateness or difference is “Speciality”.</p>
		<p>What is called the world is a mixture of the general and the special. Thus:</p>
		<img src="images/0003.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>From the General, the class or caste or society. That is the group. From the special, the individual or separateness or the particular.</p>
		<p>In Vedanta the primary state of the creation of the world is called “Avyakta” – which means that it is not yet clear, undefined, without a recognizable shape. It is also called the monostructural original single substance. When the world issued forth, i.e. when the five elements came into existence, the general as the special happened. Therefore what has an end and what is limited which came out of the limitless what is left over is still unlimited. Which means that only a part, a section, a bit becomes definable. What remains unmanifest is the general. What is manifest is special. Thus in the great expressed world one part gets transformed again and again. The rest remains the same, unchanged. Thus what is left over is the general. What is subject to transformation is special. Thus the differentiated allotropic forms will be going on non-stop as a tradition. That is the world – that which is ever expanding, that which is spreading out in new directions. In this tradition of transformation the substances of the world, according to the general characteristics there are groups and divisions; classes are formed. The quintessential sub-divisions and individual familiarities are special. They go under the names of particularities, individuality, singular characteristic, inscape, oddity or quidtars. Those things which are dependent on separate distinctions have divisions like “desha-dharma”, duties performing to desha or place, “kula dharma” duties pertaining to kula or family group and “Guna dharma” the duties belonging to inner nature. There are special duties of various kinds.</p>
		<p>Those common duties which unite all these into a single code of conduct are called “Samanya Dharma” or general duties, duties common to all worldly affairs.</p>
		<p>Our pathfinders have considered Dharma as of two kinds the general and the special. Truthfulness, justice, compassion, cleanliness, self control, limited ambition – these are general dharmas; applicable to all mankind in the same manner; But the study of the Vedas is a special dharma of Brahmin, bearing arms is the special dharma of Kshatriya, agriculture and trade are the special dharma of Vaishya – thus for various groups various prescribed dharmas have been handed down either by scriptural injunction or by tradition. From these special duties are born the special cultural variations.</p>
		<p>Even culture is of two kinds, within a certain geographical area, within a certain linguistic society, born in a particular group this is a special aspect of culture. On account of the coming together of these special aspects, the unification of common factors results in the general aspect of culture. Every culture appears general from one side and special from another side.</p>
		<p>From the general the special, again that general; again from that general the special; again in that special the general – thus it happens, the birth of the characteristics of the substances of the world. All human beings possess eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands and legs. So to that extent the qualities of all men are general; following that principle, man belongs to one group in creation. But the face of one man doesn’t resemble another’s; the nose of one man is not exactly like that of another. One man’s voice is not like that of another. If one observes carefully the intellectual and mental make up, no two individuals are of the same level and swiftness. Just as in the external appearance, internally each man is a separate creation. The characteristics of five children born to the same parents are different. Thus group is one; individuals many.</p>
		<p class="author">[-Shankra Bhashya – Brihadaranyakopanishat 2-4-9]</p>
		<p>In the general resemblance all men are one and the same. In the special category each man is different from the other. This is the arrangement of Nature. Born out of this arrangement on the one hand there is group of birth, class, caste, pedigree and family background, such general categories; one the other the existence and count of each individual as a separate entity.</p>
		<p><strong>Five Types of Difference</strong></p>
		<p>The Vedantis think of differences broadly in three categories:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Vijatiya Bheda (The difference which exists between two objects belonging to different classes): The difference that exists between tree, soil, stone, metal and such other objects.</li>
			<li>Sajatiya Bheda (The difference that exists between two objects belonging to the same class): The difference between mango tree, a neem tree, a coconut tree and a tamarind tree.</li>
			<li>Swagata Bheda (Internal difference): There are three subcategories here.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>(i)Vyasti Samashti Prabheda: The internal difference between one single mango tree and the collective mango grove.</p>
		<p>(ii)Vyashti-Vyashti Prabheda: The difference between one mango tree and another.</p>
		<p>(iii)Vyashtyavayava difference: The difference between the stem and the leaf, between the leaf and the flower, between the flower and the fruit in the same mango tree.</p>
		<p>Difference means that in some way or the other one entity is more or less than the other – it means it is different from the other. That is “Difference”.</p>
		<p>Thus the differences in appearances and characteristics are present in nature. The result of this is the myriadness of people according to groups, pedigrees, family trees, castes, generations, households and various kinds of clans, and the individual human being in each category.</p>
		<p>Each man, to the extent to which he is different in what things and to what extent is his personality or individuality to that extent. That is his uniqueness.</p>
		<p>Similarly a group of people is different from another group of people in what ways and to what extent, to that extent it is a different group, or caste, or race or tribe.</p>
		<p>The natural differences in character and profession which are not artificial are the reason for the differences in tribe, class and group.</p>
		<p>Thus in the formation of the world, because of the existence of differences between general and special characteristics, between the universal and the particular bring about mutual attraction and curiosity in life. The general characteristics are their strength becoming a two-fold inspiration for life.</p>
		<p>Because of the existence of the excess of defects and virtues mutually, the necessity for mutual dependence arises. Therefore, it is that in groups, organizations and societies, if an individual possesses all the qualities and riches needed, then he does not need anybody else. He does not need a society or a state. For a life which does not come under the influence of society or kingdom, the opportunity to flower forth and attaining proper cultural level will be lost. Thus the nature-born difference between tribes and groups and classes become promotional aspects for the organization of society and the enrichment of life.</p>
		<p>Thus the differences and variations can also become beneficial to us. Only when they break the barriers do they become harmful. To recognize its limits is the hallmark of culture. The sound knowledge of propriety is culture.</p>
		<p>From the same cow emerge both milk and dung. The “general” is the stomach. Milk and dung are “special”. Milk is general, cream, sweetened milk, khova, curds, butter, cheese, ghee and buttermilk – these are special. Thus though seven or eight items are brought out from the same milk, each one’s taste is different from that of another. Each unit performs a different function. The various differences that are achieved because of their variations of qualities and functions cannot be achieved by the single, unilateral, original milk. What milk can do, the dung cannot, what benefit comes from dung, cannot be achieved by the single, unilateral, original milk. What milk can do, the dung cannot, what benefit comes from dung, cannot come from milk either. In our world each quality has its own function to perform The goal of life of a particular group is according to that person’s wealth of qualities. This is the teaching of “Swadharma” in the Gita:</p>
		<p>[Death is one’s own duty is better; the duty of another is fraught with fear. Better is one’s own duty, though defective, than another’s duty well performed.]</p>
		<p>It is true that sanyas (the ascetic’s life) is the best among all (ashramas) duties of life. But having been born in a warrior class atmosphere and having attained fame in the art of warfare, when he is facing an army in the battlefield using fighting weapons is a greater duty than sanyas.</p>
		<p>A man’s inner strength and external circumstances together determine his duty. The same is true for each caste, each group and each folk. Each category must improve its own special aptitude, extra strength and innate wealth for the good of the society alone and bring it to fruition in carrying on with life. That is Dharma or duty, what is required for life is not a single quality excellence; not even conflict of merits. What is not a single quality excellence; not even conflict of merits. What is required is a proper synthesis of beneficial qualities. Not pollution of groups; but meaningful mutual friendship. When the jasmine remains a good jasmine, a champak remains a good champak, a rose remains a good rose (“A rose is a rose is a rose” as Gertrude Stain put it) and when these put together in a proper artistic alignment, when they are arranged in a friendly understanding of colors into a bouquet, that is the beauty of the bouquet. That is the moral thread joining together various origins, castes and classes and various generations in a unified order. A great culture is the end product and result of those various backgrounds interacting creatively. What is an essential ingredient for its beneficial existence is a discriminating propriety – an informed sense of priorities.</p>
		<p>A cultured man regards individual merit as a sacred thing. He does not try to shape others in his own mould and make them like himself. The belief of the cultured man is “There is a difference between one individual and another; let each individual jiva or soul develop according to its own innate propriety and internal order, its own dharma or duty and what is natural for it. One does not have to become like another. Repetition may not be the design of nature. In order to keep on doing the same thing over and over again, Mother Nature is not lacking in resourcefulness and skill. Variety itself is the ever present characteristic of creation. Each person’s philosophy of life is his own”. Therefore he is sympathetic to the life-style of others, quite different from his own. He can never imagine that he alone is right and that he is the model for everybody.</p>
		<p>He develops the same kind of tolerant understanding towards other societies and other cultures. Though there are several types of culture like regional culture, national culture, linguistic culture, religious and class culture, caste and traditional culture – though there are all these composite cultures, he searches for the common factors among all these which are complementary to each other and integrated them appropriately into his own mainstream culture.</p>
