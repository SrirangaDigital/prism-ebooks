<p><strong>T</strong>he characteristics of a cultured man are basically five:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The knowledge of one’s own place in the world.</li>
<li>Our actions – An understanding how it affects others.</li>
<li>Self-control.</li>
<li>An integrated view.</li>
<li>Simplicity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Morals (“Neeti”)</strong></p>
<p>At the conceptual level all these are aspects of our morals and ends or goals. Here the word “Neeti” means that which can bring us our intended goal – that which can get us our obtainable objective. Smoothness, politeness, justice – all these are forms of morals. It is a means of bringing two people together. At one end there is the intender, at the other the intended object or individual. The action at one end reaches out to the other end. Thus the personalities of both these individuals according to this method will be moving always from here to there and back from there to here. Therefore each individual action that man performs in society, each quality that he shows will have its effect in two places. One pertains to the doer, the other to the person affected. When a man tells a lie it shunts and twists the soul of the speaker. It deceives another person. Thus our actions and evil actions affects in two ways. One of them is Self-regarding; The other is world-regarding. That behaviour which is beneficial to both is moral. Truthfulness, cleanliness, non-violence, non-covetousness, generosity, control of senses – these are moral principles mutually beneficial. A person who follows these things is pure and develops his inner strength and at the same time does justice to co-workers without being a cheat or being unjust.</p>
<p>For this kind of dual moral principle, the origin is a respectful attitude. First of all he must have self-respect. A man must maintain a high level in his speech and actions. He must feel within himself a lacuna if he deviates even an inch from this conduct. He must never give room for any situation where he has to feel ashamed about any of his actions even while not being observed by anyone. He must not feel that he is mean even in his own eyes. Thus a man who has confidence in his own integrity of his conscience has self-respect. How can a man without it respect others?</p>
<p>The second one is the respect he must have in respect of the world. Just as a person has his own individuality, just as he has his own rights and responsibilities – don’t the others too? There is a necessity of giving respect to them also. Just as he should not embarrass his own soul, he must not give room for other’s souls to get embarrassed. To provide strength without hindering the flowering forth of the just desires of others and without hampering their self-respect is the second part of the moral principle.</p>
<p>Thus in our worldly affairs acting with the two – fold interest of oneself and others, in a mutually beneficial way is moral behavior. When once the moral foundation is strong and firm what can rest on it are the manifestations and decorations of culture.</p>
<p><strong>The Knowledge of One’s Own Place in the World</strong></p>
<p>A cultured man will be always searching for an appropriate place for himself in his world. It is certain that each living being has its own place in the world order. But which is that place? Every man has the difficulty of finding out its limits and limitations. Here a little experience may be given as an example. It happened when I was a small boy. In order to ward off the evil effects of the cholera disease which had invaded our village, some friends had arranged a bhajan (singing of songs in praise of God) on every Saturday. The bhajan would take place by turns in various houses. On the day on which our turn came, big carpets had been spread in the living room, bright kerosene lamps had been lit and in addition to that on all four sides oil lamps in artistic metal holders were kept and the entire house had been cleaned up and beautifully decorated. In the centre of the hall, facing the door were placed the large framed pictures of Gods which were decorated with flower garlands. In the central portion of the hall a low table had been put covered by a nice cloth and on it were arranged silver plates with flowers, sandal incense and coconuts. Agarbathis, pleasant smelling incense sticks were exuding sweet scent. I had also seen packets of sugar and dried coconut pieces being made, along with areca nuts folded in betel leaves – This “prasadam” to be distributed after the chanting was over. It was but natural that in my mind enthusiasm was springing forth after seeing all this. In that celebration I and my two friends were sitting near the table right at the centre wearing good clothes. That was the time when the bhajan group would arrive at our house from the temple. The group were just about to step in. Then my grandfather came into the hall to see if the arrangements were alright. The moment he saw me he rushed to me pulled me up and quickly took me to a corner and sat me down. Then a dialogue turned between him and an elderly friend of his:</p>
<p>Friend : He is just a child; let him sit there.</p>
<p>Grandfather : Let him stay; but let him stay in a place fit for him.</p>
<p>Friend : He is the master of the house. Let him stay where he likes.</p>
<p>Grandfather : Yes; he is the master, that is why he must make room for guests and he must stay in the background.</p>
<p>Friend : Can he know all this at this young age? Grandfather : No he can’t; but we can. We must teach.</p>
<p>I don’t remember that I got deflated and wanting in any way when my grandfather did this. After the Bhajan was over and guests had departed, when we were having our dinner, my grandfather talked to me affectionately and said, “child, when you go to a gathering you must know what your place is and stay there”. That is intelligent behaviour. You can know the worth of a clerk by where he places his ink-pot. Similarly when a man is visiting, you can see what kind of man he is by observing the place he chooses to sit. My grandfather added things like “When you sit nobody should say – Don’t sit there” etc. (Nobody should think that such bits of advice have had an effect on me). That advice applies to the large world also. On account of the history of our family, our birth, our educational achievement, our looks and behaviour and also our good fortune – these will have determined our place in society. Along with what is due to us, the rights and honours that are due to others will also have been incorporated in the way we are treated. The understanding of the mutual agreements between us and the others, this knowledge must determine what we should not exceed where we should diminish ourselves in our social conduct. The place determines the responsibility. After comprehending one’s own responsibility, the proper behaviour in keeping with it. On the one hand it is the practice of smooth and gentlemanly behaviour. On the other the flowering forth of one’s strength and ability. Thus the development of man’s capacity in belonging to the world.</p>
<p>Realizing where one belongs is the mother of the knowledge of one’s duty. In whatever given circumstances on duty is defined by our own inclinations and strength on the one hand and the wellbeing of our surrounding neighbours’ desires and hopes. This is the concept of one’s own dharma – “Swadharma”. The loss between what is external and what is internal is minimized through acting in a manner that maximum benefits are obtained. This manner of conduct is dharma. When an individual looks at dharma from the point of view of special circumstances, that is his “swadharma”. From one’s own position comes his “swadharma”.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that many of the ills of our world is because of some people in society trying to aspire for positions beyond their merit and some others occupying important positions and not doing anything to acquire the necessary qualifications afterwards. When a man worth a rupee behaves like a man worth two rupees, the experience of society is like the experience of a man who pushes into his mouth a Marcel of food which is too big for his mouth. That is a tradition of uselessness. There is another kind of preposterousness which is the opposite of this. That is also special with us. That is, a two- rupee worth object. Politeness need not descend to the level of self effacement. Our modesty should not go that far as to make others feel embarrassed. When a man goes to a gathering is well known the people will have an idea where he should sit. If, instead of going there, he exhibits modesty by self abnegation, to the extent to which he pretends, the people also exhibit exaggerated respect towards him. The result is that the lookers on will be disgusted. When a man goes to an assembly of people, he must not draw attention to himself either through his dress code or outlandish behaviour. It is the characteristic of a gentleman to mix with them unobtrusively like sugar in milk or rhythm in music. The main consideration should be not to rock the boat by upsetting the general pattern with his own difference. When a man visits another also, it is the same principle. Just as we expect a certain code of conduct from them, they also expect it from us. That is just. Our apparel and conversation must follow that code. The freedom that does not respect others is actually vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Our Understanding of the Suggested Desires of Others</strong></p>
<p>Just now a word has been said about external circumstances. The important aspect of it is the knowledge of other’s intentions which are left unspoken. We must be thinking constantly about the effect of what we do on others. Only the belief that our intention is good does not make our conduct beneficial. We must guess the attitude of others in relation to our intended actions.</p>
<p>[Even a cow can understand what we communicate either by our speech or by the expression of the eye. Horses and elephants carry the burdens hoisted to their backs without being told to do so. He is wise who knows what to do by intelligent guesswork and not by a verbal order. The knowledge of merely suggested meaning is the mark of wisdom].</p>
<p>There is no greatness in doing what the others ask us to in so many words. We may act according to their wishes after they have literally, verbally expressed themselves either by a sense of obligation or because of the fear of displeasing them, or by making them feel obliged to us or any other reason apart from knowing their mind. The satisfaction arising in others as a result of this is not of the first degree. They get a superior sort of satisfaction by our action of knowing their unexpressed mental desires. Those others remain tight-lipped on account of a delicate sensibility and don’t openly express their desires may even feel hurt by our crude and selfish actions, unaware of their wants.</p>
<p>Thus in order to understand what actions may please or displease others, one must place oneself in their position. The aforesaid knowledge of one’s own place must be conjoined with their position. A cultured man is he who asks himself questions like “If I was in their position how discreet would I be? What would I perhaps do? What would be the right thing to do?”</p>
<p>A cultured man is he who is constantly questioning himself “How would you feel if the others did to you what you want to do to them? If they spoke about you as you have about them. What would happen to you?” Our sacred texts – Sruti, Smriti and Puranas are full of this message.</p>
<p>These are the words of Isavasyopanishat</p>
<p>[He who sees all living in himself and himself in all living beings, he is without attachment and fear].</p>
<p class="text-right"><em>-Bhagavadgita – 6-29</em></p>
<p>[Himself in all beings and everyone in himself].</p>
<p class="text-right"><em>-Bhagavadgita – 6- 32</em></p>
<p>[As if he is everywhere he acts with a sense of equality].</p>
<p class="text-right"><em>-Apastambha Smriti</em></p>
<p>[All beings as oneself].</p>
<p>Such statements are found in a hundred places in the Apastambha Smriti. The Mahabharata and the Smriti Literature abound in such sentences.</p>
<p class="text-right"><em>-Devala Smriti</em></p>
<p>[A man who should not do to others what is not good for himself].</p>
<p class="text-right"><em>-Dakshya Smriti<p class="text-right"><em></p>
<p>[He who desires good for himself must see others as he sees himself. Happiness and sorrow for the others will be the same as in his own case].</p>
<p>Thus in man’s mutual relationships what brings out pleasantness is the empathy arising and of equating himself with others. What makes for lack of interest is the neglect of the consideration for others. If the joints and wheels of this machine called the world have to run smoothly, silently without creating and croaking and rubbing against each other, then the greasy oil must be flowing freely which is the oil of brotherly feeling and mutual understanding. This kind of unification and integration of one with the others is possible with the pre-requisite of the expansion of the feelings of fraternity. With this flowing of the feeling of oneness between self and others the knowledge of the unspoken thoughts of others becomes possible. This is what has been referred to earlier as “Atmaupamya” in the Bhagavadgita (6-32). The means to achieve this are looking straight at Truth, the discriminating worldly wisdom and contemplation of the Ultimate Reality.</p>
<p>The more a person perceives the depth of human nature, the more a person contemplates on the trials and tribulations of man, when he sees the frailties and foibles of man, what he experiences is not anger but compassion. He cannot criticize too severely the little desires and constrictions. Tolerance, generosity, forgiveness, these are the qualities of paramount importance that a cultured man has cultivated. When he encounters a mistake, he imagines himself in that position and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>The words of an old man who passed away recently may be recollected here. That is something which I know as a direct witness. The old man in question had lived a good life. Because of some unavoidable family reasons he had to sell his house. The people who bought it had a comfortable dwelling place. The man who sold it had to use that road quite frequently. If he met the man who owned the house now, he would make polite enquiries whether he had found happiness in it. Once the new owner invited the old man into the house. He begged the old man with genuine devotion, “Please come, in, see the place and give us your blessing”. He did not agree to go inside. He said “Please don’t compel me”. The owner stopped the invitation right there and kept quiet. After the old man walked a bit further his grandson who was with him asked him “Why did you say so?” The answer of the old man was this “Child, if I had entered the house, would not old memories come crowding in? - How nice is the house now, which was once ours! Thoughts like what a pity we could not retain it would arise and may be it would have given rise to envy! Is it a good thing? It is possible some evil would come their way! Why should we give room to such bad things? May God protect them. Why should our misfortune affect them?” This is the attitude of cultured people.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Self Control</strong></p>
<p>The way to facilitate the others desires, is through self- control. The selfishness that is hidden within and will be taking hundreds of subtle forms. It will be emanating deceiving our knowledge. No matter how hard we try to hide our desires of ambitions like amassing wealth either in cash or kind, the intense fondness for the object of our desire, the hankering after power, the drive for fame, our actions controlled by them will be quite obvious for others. At least once in a way, when the others object to it, we will realize it to some extent. At least to the extent that man wants to hide them by protesting that he doesn’t have such defects – to the extent of not showing those traits – he will have a sense of shame.</p>
<p>Even more latent than these vain desires which rear their heads sometimes, there are certain pet attachments. We parade them by giving nice names like justifiable pride, partiality to merit, excellence of mind, etc. If our little child utters a fond word, if it does something smart, we feel that we ourselves have done it and broadcast it to the whole world that it can bring about universal admiration. If they start praising the cleverness of their own children, we have no patience to listen to it. We call it a “bore” – a bane. We are great, our child is not like that of others; we are special people – This illusion will be hiding in the depths of our hearts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the illusion that we are not like the others takes the form of casual conversation. In daily life, every man will find an occasion when he has to speak about others. Some people will be creating such circumstances themselves in addition to existing situations. In such cases, the critical comments on others’ merits and defects will be taking place with great enthusiasm. Like a goldsmith weighing an ornament in a balance, we put the other’s characters in a balance. Then if someone asks “Why are you interested so much in others?” We reply that “Such judgment of merits and de-merits are in the interests of the world”. We hesitate to admit that by de-bunking the greatness of others we derive a sort of satisfaction in our lives. We forget to ask ourselves who gave us the authority to sit in judgment over the character of others. Usually the people in public life who come to power behave as if fate has immersed them with the authority of the job “you go and improve the world”. If they don’t have such a self-confidence, their job cannot be carried out with enthusiasm. But the same self-confidence when it transgresses carefulness becomes the course for injustice on account of over- confident showmanship. As a matter of course, every member of society will have a responsibility, at least to some extent of sitting in judgment over other people’s actions. However, only to the extent to which it is absolutely necessary without overstepping the limit of its duty does a cultured man indulge himself in assessing the merits of others – and reducing the harshness to the maximum extent possible, confining oneself to the limits of one’s duty – that is the caution of the man of culture.</p>
<p>In a democracy – in a set up where the man who is supposed to be the representative of the country has the power of making laws – the culture which takes the form of giving up the ego may not find much encouragement. Nobody gives way to a person who thinks that his knowledge is limited and abilities are modest and stays back can find a place. Only a fellow who is a go-getter and pushes around and elbows others out will find a place in democracy. This politics of the people will blunt all the niceties of human nature and roughens them.</p>
<p>Thus selfishness works in various ways in our nature. Secretly, openly, directly, deviously, openly, indirectly – it will be working all the time in all sorts of ways. It cannot be said that it is evil in all circumstance. Just as it has possibilities of injustice it can also work in just ways. So what we have to desire here is not the total destruction of selfishness, not a complete cessation of it but only its orderly control. Selfishness must be tempered. Let there be self-interest; but let it be within limits, let it work, but let it work under control. Let the principle of righteousness determine its ways and means.</p>
