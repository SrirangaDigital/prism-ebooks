		<p><strong>L</strong>et us remember along with this a statement of Maharshi Manu:</p>
		<p>[(1) That thirst for truth which searches every possible source of knowledge (2) That action by doing which and that conduct and behaviour which does not bring shame and (3) That which bestows peace and tranquility for the inner soul – that unceasing search for truth – that contemplation of general, common good – that abidance in the welfare of the inner being These are the hallmarks of the “sattvic” nature.]</p>
		<p>Commitment to the acquisition of knowledge, respect for the world, Self abidance – under these three headings are contained the desire for new scientific knowledge, the search for the road to progress, lack of vanity, politeness, thinking of the good of others resulting in pleasant behaviour, a philanthropic attitude, partiality for discriminating ultimate Reality and devotion to metaphysical truth.</p>
		<p>Isn’t this what constitutes culture?</p>
