		<p><strong>C</strong>ulture means the education of the Self â€“ the education of the Self which takes into account the entire universe.</p>
		<p>When culture attains its full fruition, then man becomes the universal man. In that state the limitations of time and space cannot bind him.</p>
		<p>Let him stay anywhere in this world, in any situation, there he cannot become a foreigner; he adjusts himself to those people; he responds to that situation. He acts as if he is from that place itself lives for those ideals.</p>
