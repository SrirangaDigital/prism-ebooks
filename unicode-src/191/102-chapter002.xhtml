		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">DRAVIDIANS</h1>
		<p>Romila Thapar rightly points out that the Aryan issue is probably the most complex and complicated theory in Indian history. If the Aryan - Dravidian issue has confused the scholarly world for so long without any possibility of consensus in the near future, what about the feelings of a simple youngster who was scared of the consequences of A.I.T and the threats of Dravidian zealots to force him to get out of their Dravidian land? The problem got further complicated by the fact that he is not far removed from the Tamil language which is the most important component of the Dravidian culture. There are three sects among Brahmins in the South. Unlike the other two sects, the sect to which he belongs is more proficient in Tamil than many who proclaim to be products of the Tamil culture. As a matter of fact the Aiyengars are known as “Ubhaya Vedantis” i.e. upholders of two Vedas - One in Tamil and the other in Sanskrit. Therefore, I cannot distinguish myself either from the Dravidians or the Aryans whose very strong roots are supposed to be in Tamil and Sanskrit respectively. Therefore, the question whether I have an Aryan origin or a Dravidian one or something else has been troubling me for quite some time.</p>
		<p>First let us take the case of the Dravidians, which seems to be easier to solve than the Aryans. Here the views expressed by scholars on the subject may give an indication to their origin and migration. Among the writers there are two opposing groups, one suggesting that the Dravidians were outsiders who came to South India and the other group stating that the Dravidians migrated from South India to other parts of the world. First let us examine the views of the former group of scholars.</p>
		<p>a) Lahovary N, in his book “Dravidian Origins and the West” published in 1963 has stated that the Dravidians were born in the Mediterranean area and migrated to India in the recent past (based on body shape, culture, spoken language, social habits etc.).</p> 
		<p>b) One group of writers (foremost among them being Nilakanta Sastri) suggested West Asia as the Dravidians’ original homeland for the following reasons:</p>
		<p>1. Elamites follow the matrilineal system similar to the one followed in southern parts of India.</p> 
		<p>2. In Sumeria, there was a place known as “OOR” which is a Tamil word.</p>
		<p>3. Sumerian temples were similar to Dravidian temples.</p>
		<p>c) In the olden days, people in present day Iran spoke language known as Scythia which had similarities to Dravidian languages. Therefore, scholars like Caldwell thought that Dravidians originated from there.</p>
		<p>d) Suryanarayana Sastri in his ‘Tamil Varalaru’ suggested that the Tamils were none other than Mongols from Tibet because of similarities in body structure and social habits.</p>
		<p>e) The strongest link for the Dravidians is with Africa. A whole book can be written on this aspect and the genetic results seem to favour this fact.</p>
		<p>f) According to some scholars, Dravidians migrated from Australia. Genetic results, linguistic connections and similarities of social customs of the Australian aborigines are strong pointers for this theory.</p>
		<p>g) Apart from the conclusions based on A.I.T there are other connections between North and South India. A language spoken in Baluchistan has similarities with Dravidian languages. There are supposed to be 14 languages spoken in Central and North India which connect with Tamil. In the jungles, between Bihar and Bengal, Dravidian languagesare spoken. All these lead to the proposition that Dravidians migrated from North India.</p> 
		<p>Various suggestions made by different groups of people have been summarized and given in Table 1.</p>

		<p>Based on the facts in the table, migrations have been illustrated in Fig 1.1. Looking at the table and the figure, it seems that Dravidians had migrated from many places on Earth. If we assume that even some of the propositions are correct, the answer is that Tamils originated from many places on Earth and converged towards South India. How can a single ethnic group originate in more than one place? Taking all the evidence quoted as correct, let us now reverse the direction of migration as shown in Fig 1.2. In this case, there is no contradicition because a particular ethnic group originating from one place and migrating to many places is easily understandable and does not produce conflicting results. To support this reversal of direction of migration let us look at the views of scholars who had followed this line of thinking.</p> 
		<p>Sangarapillai in his ‘WE TAMILS’ has also listed a number of views of scholars who suggested migration of Dravidians from India to other places. Some of these are given below:</p> 
		<p>a) H.G. Wells, the great historian, writes in his concise “History of the World” that these people who were black and brown in colour had migrated beyond India right up  to the Pacific Ocean. They were the only civilized race in the ancient world and they were the architects of the  new stone-age civilization. In fact, the people of the present day world, though so widely divergent in races as they claim themselves to be, fundamentally belong to this one single race<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-102-01">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>b) You still find in Deccan the remains of the Stone-age civilization. It is from here people migrated to Central India and the Gangetic Plains and the North-western parts of India. They went up to the Himalayas.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-102-02">**</a></sup></p>
		<p>c) One of the current theories of historians, is that the people from the lands of Central Blue Ocean migrated from the West towards the East. However, research done later indicates that the migration was from the East towards the West. They had stayed for a very long period and migrated towards the West only after stabilizing their culture in India. They spread our culture right up to Mesopotamia and other British Islands.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-102-03">*</a></sup></p> 
		<p>Regarding the Australian connection, K.P. Aravanan has given ample evidence to prove that the Dravidians migrated from India and Sri Lanka towards Australia. Further, it is very interesting to note that the boomerang was probably used by Dravidians long, long ago and has now become an object of worship in some Dravidian communities. As the boomerang is still used by aborigines of Australia and it is an object of  worship for the Dravidians, it can be concluded that the group which worships the object should have been an earlier user. All the above evidence prove that Dravidians originated from areas near South India and Ceylon, and then migrated to various parts of the world as shown in Fig 1.2.</p>
