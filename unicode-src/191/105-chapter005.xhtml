		<p>Naturally, I started thinking whether any of the traditional beliefs of the oldest civilization in the world would be of help in establishing our roots. I realized that I have been chanting a “Mantra” known as “Sankalpam” for more than seventy years now. It is a Hindu custom to chant this “Sankalpam” before the start of any ritual, ceremony, puja etc., The “Sankalpam” is in two parts, the first part being an invocation and the second part defining the time and place as to when and where the function is being performed. The second part is totally secular and it is testimony for the amazing scientific knowledge of ancient Hindus.</p>
 <p>The first line in the second part of the mantra states that we are in the beginning of the second half of `Brahma’s life. The subsequent lines define the division of time such as Kalpa, Manvanthara etc. Further it states that we are in the first half of Kaliyuga of the seventh Manvanthara (total Manvantharas being fourteen). After stating the time as the first half of Kaliyuga, the mantra starts defining the place where the function is being performed. The place is defined as Bharata Kanda, Part of Bharata Varsha which in turn is part of ‘JAMBU DVIPA’. Rather, the emphatic statement is that the function is being performed in ‘JAMBU DVIPA’, DVIPA meaning an island. Therefore, we have to interpret that the mantra was in vogue at a place known as Jambu Dvipa and people now chanting the mantra are from the place which was obviously an island. If India is an island, we need not probe the matter any further but we definitely know that India has never been an island ever since the first modern human arrived around 150,000-200,000 years ago.</p>
 <p>Jambu Dvipa is also mentioned in the Puranas. Particularly, the Vishnu purana gives details about the place and it says, “One of the Manus divided the Bhooloka into seven islands. One of the seven islands known as Jamboo Dvipa was given to Agnitdran who had nine sons. He divided Jamboo Dvipa into nine parts (Varshas) and the Southern part was known as Bharata Varsha. Bharata Kanda was a part of Bharata Varsha and it was believed that only those who have done many good deeds would be born in Bharata Kanda also known as ‘Punya Bhoomi’.</p>
 <p>It is generally believed that the Puranas and Tamil literature had separate origins. In Tamil literature, known as the Sangam literature, there are abundant references to Naaval theevu. Naaval theevu means Jambu Dvipa. The ‘Naaval’ and ‘Jambu’ refer to a fruit (Rose apple). Probably Jamboo Dvipa (Naaval theevu) was an island with plenty of Jamboo trees and hence the name. Tamil literature also says that Naaval theevu was a very large island and it was part of Kumari continent that existed in the Indian Ocean.</p>
 <p>Therefore, it is most reasonable to postulate that people from an island or islands had to migrate to the nearest landmass, India, due to some catastrophic event. The Sankalpam gives an irrefutable suggestion to this idea and it gets support from the Puranas. However, it is the ancient Tamil literature that talks volumes about submergence of areas South of India. Detailed research is necessary to piece together all the information contained in Tamil literature, Sanskrit literature and other ancient records. Like in the United States, the Indian Universities should have departments for Geo-Mythology and undertake extensive underwater studies in the Indian Ocean area and from a historical perspective, do a research on Sangam literature.</p>
 <p>After discussing the idea of the place (Jambu Dvipa) mentioned in Sankalpam let us look at other pieces of information contained therein. In the first line itself, it refers to the time as the beginning of the second half of Brahma’s life which roughly corresponds to half the life of the solar system. Recent research has clearly established that we are in the middle of the Sun’s life. How our ancestors were able to find out such a fact without modern gadgets and money power may for ever remain a mystery.</p>
 <p>The next lines of the mantra refer to Kalpa, Manvanthara etc., Mr. Cho. Ramaswamy, an outstanding Puranic writer, has calculated the period involved in his Tamil book ‘Hindu Ocean’. He has arrived at a figure of 4.3 billion years for the present life of the solar system of a 8.6 billion years of its full life. In his book ‘Lost Discoveries’, Dick Teresi says that Carl Sagan describes several ancient creation myths which are a tribute to ‘human audacity’. According to Dick Teresi, Carl Sagan is drawn towards Indian cyclic cosmology where Brahma, the great creator God, dreams the Universe into existence. He adds that according to the religious scholar Mircca Eliade, during each Brahma day, 4.32 billion years to be exact, the universe putters along. He also concludes that ancient Hindus believed that each Brahma day and Brahma night lasted 4.32 billion years each. Rather the Hindus have conceived of the life of solar system in billion of years as against the thousands of years prevalent in the early Western culture.</p>
 <p>I am tempted to add something more to what Dick Teresi had said. In Hindu belief, Narayana in the reclining form represents the whole universe and the solar system is represented by Brahma who sprouts from the naval of Narayana. Brahma’s life is different to that of the universe. In another 4.32 billion years the Sun is expected to expand nearly 200 times and envelop all the inner planets. This fact is also mentioned in the Puranas -- the inner planets will vanish at the end of Brahma’s day and night. However, the whole universe is subjected to expansion and contraction similar to the process mentioned in the Big Bang theory. Therefore, the Hindus distinguished the whole universe as a much bigger entity, with the solar system being a part of it, predicted the life of the solar system and offered a beautiful explanation pertaining to the whole universe similar to the Big Bang theory. Probably because of this, Indian cosmology clearly has the cutting edge compared to the one directional vision. The reason I have explained the significance of Sankalpam is to demonstrate the amazing knowledge that the ancient Hindus had in respect of cosmology and the accurate details they gave on the life of the solar system. When such great brains referred to Jambu Dvipa, the statement carries a lot of weight.</p>
