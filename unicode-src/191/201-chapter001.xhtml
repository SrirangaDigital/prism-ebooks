		<p>A.I.T is still influencing the history of India, its politics and also social relationships. From the time of Max Müller, the supporting pillars of A.I.T. have been archeology, anthropology and linguistics. The anti A.I.T group derives support from the new findings about the Saraswathi Civilisation with a large number of sites along the paleo channels, the repeated mention of Saraswathi in the Vedas, astronomical dating of the Vedas etc. During the last 30 years, genetic science has grown in a big way and it is giving support to both the groups. All this means that the controversy still exists in spite of the emergence of new genetic data. Luca Cavelli Sforza has opined that the other sciences such as cultural anthropology, demography, economics, ecology, sociology, etc are becoming pillars of interpretation. Spencer Wells also has echoed similar views when he says that “Science can sometimes run roughshod over cultural beliefs”. Therefore, he has suggested a collaborative effort between people around the world who are interested in learning more about their shared history. I have taken the cue from such distinguished scientists to find out whether the culture of the oldest civilization could give clues to solve the Aryan problem.</p>
		<p>Having decided to go on a cultural odyssey, we must know what is meant by culture. Culture covers all that we know and it is learnt from others, especially our ancestors. We may also add something to the culture of our society and it goes on accumulating from generation to generation. There is a close resemblance between culture and genome in the sense that they both accumulate useful information from generation to generation. Therefore, let us first look at the cultural history of the modern humans and see whether it can help us in our search.</p>
		<p>If we scan the cultural history of modern humans during the prehistoric period, there have been two major cultural explosions, one around 50,000 years ago and another about 10,000 years ago. Till about 50,000 years ago, the so called modern human remained in a very primitives state without any advancement at the cultural level. But around 50,000 years ago, he seems to have suddenly become culturally modern. There are independent archeological evidence to support this sudden transformation. It is this change which brought about improvement in hunting and gathering technology. Also we are able to see the first use of different materials such as ivory, bone, shell etc. This was also the time when they started making ornaments and other useful objects. Why such a transformation took place is not clearly known.</p>
		<p>The next major cultural explosion was around 10,000 years ago, popularly known as the Neolithic Revolution, when human were able to domesticate plants and animals apart from creating objects like pottery which never existed before. Credit should go to V. Gordon Childe for coining the phrase ‘Neolithic Revolution’. In order to appreciate this change, we should understand the difference between plant collection and plant domestication. In the former case, all grain harvested is consumed as food. But in the latter case, part of harvested material is used as food and the rest kept for planting later on. When plants are domesticated, man decides what to produce, how much to produce and where to produce.</p>
		<p>During the food gathering process, man benefits by whatever nature can give to him and he has no role to play in the process. However, after domestication, man became the master or in other words, interfered with nature to gain an advantage. The domestication of animals can also be explained in a similar manner by contrasting the ideas of animal keeping and animal domestication. As regards the creation of new objects for the convenience of man, pottery takes pride of place because it was probably the first item to be made by man. From whatever evidence we have, the Neolithic Revolution was the result of collective experiments involving many generations of human spanning over long periods of many thousands of years. However, it can be said that occurred prior to 8000 BC because around this time we have clear cut evidence of the Neolithic Revolution. Around 8000 B.C, the hunter gatherer society suddenly became settled farming communities. Even though we see such evidence in Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, the best explored site seems to be Jericho near Jerusalem. Excavations have been going on at the site from 1870’s and it is the work of Dame Kathaleen Kenon in mid 1950’s which changed the concept of human history. For almost 200,000 years, modern humans were slaves of nature but during the Neolithic Revolution all that changed and man started becoming his own master. Therefore, this reversal of approach on the part of modern humans is the most significant event in human history.</p>
		<p>Now let us discuss Kenyon’s findings at Jericho. She found a human settlement dating from around 10,000 B.C. when hunter - gatherer communities lived off what nature gave them. What indicated a hunter gather society, she found the remains of an early farming community, the dating of which happened to be immediately afterwards without any time gap. Her excavation revealed not only the time agricultural communities sprang up but also that the event in Jericho was not an evolution but a sudden change caused by people with Neolithic knowledge arriving at the site and introducing their new technology.</p>
		<p>Let us now explore what was happening in South Asia, Mehrgarh is a Neolithic site (7,000-3000 B.C) on the Kachi plain of Baluchistan (Pakistan) and one of the earliest sites with ample evidence of farming (wheat and barley) and herding of cattle, sheep and goats in South Asia. The site is located on the route from Sukkur to Quetta up the Bolan river. Bolan Pass is reported to be an ancient travel route between India and Iran, and more ancient than the Khyber Pass. The site was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986 by a French team lead by Jean-Francois Jerrige. The farming and pastoralist village at the site is dated around 7,000 BC with mud brick houses and granaries. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 B.C. when it was abandoned. We can call Mehrgarh a close contemporary of Jericho.</p>
		<p>The excavations in South Asia are of smaller magnitude when compared with that in the Middle East. Fortunately, the site at Mehrgarh is a lucky find when compared with other places in India. However, early centres for agricultural communities lay in the Vindhyan fringes of Southern Uttar Pradesh. Explorations are going on at many places in the area and at the moment we can assume unequivocally the early dates for rice cultivation at the northern fringes of Vindhyas as 7,500 to 7,000 B.C. which are the C-14 dates at places like Koldihwa and Mahagara in the Allahabad district of U.P.</p>
		<p>Now turning our attention towards East Asia, there are equally early dates for rice cultivation in China on the banks of the Yellow river and the mouths of the Yellow and Yangtse rivers. Also excavations in Spirit Cave in Thailand (South East Asia) indicate an agricultural community which is certainly more than that of simple food gatherers. Therefore, we can conclude that around 10,000 years from the present, Neolithic ideas were brought to many areas (Middle East, South Asia, East Asia) from some place where the Neolithic Revolution actually took place.</p>
		<p>Around 10,000 years ago, there was a sudden transformation from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies in the following three areas located far apart from each other. a) Middle East - Jericho etc b) South Asia - Mehrgarh etc c) East and South East Asia - Mouth of Yellow and Yangtze rivers etc. (See Fig 2.1)</p>
		<p>As the introduction of agriculture at the above three areas was quite sudden and the three places are far apart from one another, it is reasonable to infer that the new knowledge originated at some other place and then taken to these three places. The newly acquired knowledge could have travelled either through the sea route or land route.</p>
		<p>The reasons and processes of advancement of the newly acquired knowledge through sea routes are entirely different when compared with land routes. First, the idea originates at a place and gets stabilized there. In case the people of an area surrounded by sea have to move out due to natural disasters like a rise in the sea level, they have to move out in sea crafts to new places. They will be able to travel as fast as the ships</p>

		<p>can take them till they reach the new destination by covering probably thousands of kilometers at a stretch. Then they would have established themselves in the new place and from then onwards the newly imported expertise would have spread over the land at a slow pace. Generally, it is technology that diffuses slowly over land routes, whereas it is people with knowledge who move in the case of sea routes.</p>
		<p>Many scientists and historians who have written about the spread of agriculture have suggested that it originated in the Fertile Crescent and spread from there up to England in the western direction and to the Indian subcontinent in the eastern direction. The spread of agriculture in the western direction is well documented archeologicaly and there is convincing data to support this suggestion. However, regarding the spread towards the eastern direction, substantial convincing data is not available and therefore, this is a subject which has to be discussed in detail to arrive at a reasonable picture. From the agricultural expansion towards Europe, it has been estimated that it took almost 4000 years to reach England. This means that when the technology travels over land, it does at the rate of approximately one kilometer per year.</p>
		<p>There is enough evidence to show that the transformation from hunter-gatherer style to farming style at the three places was sudden, indicating that the process was not evolutionary in nature but suddenly caused by the arrival of people possessing the new knowledge. Therefore, we can postulate that the new knowledge got generated somewhere and from that one place, people moved to all the three places simultaneously, i.e. obviously through the sea routes. Further, the place of origin of the new knowledge should be more or less in a straight direction from the three places. Again, there would have been an overriding reason as to why people with the new knowledge had to suddenly move out from their established homes towards unknown places.</p>
		<p>James Watson speculated that invention of language might have caused the first creative explosion. Extending his ideas further, development of language might have also been a contributory factor in respect of the Neolithic Revolution. Therefore, as Tamil and Sanskrit are the oldest languages of the world, I looked at ancient chronicles in the two languages for possible clues pertaining to Neolithic Revolution. In Tamil literature, I could find ample references about the habitable area in the Indian Ocean beyond South India. This area was known as Kumari Kandam and it was swallowed up by the sea in stages. Taking up the thread from the previous paragraph, I realized that Kumari Kandam fits the bill neatly to explain the sudden change of life styles in Jericho, Mehgarh and the river mouths of China. Those places are radially dispersed from Kumari Kandam and there is a vast stretch of sea between these places and Kumari Kandam. Most importantly, many parts of Kumari Kandam must have got submerged at the end of the last ice age necessitating the migrations. When I pursued my effort further and meticulously scanned the Sanskrit literature, to my great surprise I stumbled on a Puranic story which seemed to describe the Neolithic Revolution. The Puranic story is known as ‘Samudra Manthana’ or ‘Churning of the Milky Ocean’. Therefore, I shall narrate the story of Samudra Manthana as I know it and then try to establish whether it correlates to the events connected with the Neolithic Revolution.</p>
