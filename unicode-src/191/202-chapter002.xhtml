		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">SAMUDRA MANTHANA</h1>
		<p>Samudra Manthana means ‘churning of the Ocean’ [of milk]. Churning of the Milky Ocean has pride of place among Puranic stories because of its great significance. I have heard this story from many sources - from illiterate villagers to well-accomplished harikatha exponents. But the impressions of the Puranic stories I have retained are mostly from the movies seen by me during my younger days. In the olden days Indian movies portrayed only Puranic stories. If one looks at the stories superficially, there are contradictory versions and it would be easy to conclude that they are a pack of lies or mere nonsense as believed by secular Westerners and the non-believers in Tamil Nadu. However, the popularity of Puranic stories amongst the vast sections of the Indian population cannot be denied.</p>
 <p>Therefore, I have decided to evaluate the story of Samudra Manthana and find out whether I can extract any useful information from it as Sangarapillai believed. The story is contained in Puranas and there are contradictory versions as far as the story aspect is concerned. However, the core textmaterial of the story remains the same.</p>
 <p>According to Kurma Purana, one day Indra, the King of the Devas, was in his court enjoying the songs and dances of Apsaras. After the entertainment was over, Kubera, the treasurer of the Devas got up and announced that all his wealth had vanished due to indiscriminate spending by Indra and added that the other Devas had also squandered his wealth. Vishnu agreed with Kubera and advised the assembly that the one way to regain the riches was to churn the Ocean. He also stressed the fact that the Devas alone would not be able to do the job and it was essential to enlist the support of the Asuras. The Asuras agreed to help the Devas to churn the Ocean. Both the parties went to the Milky Ocean and placed mount Mantara in it. Mount Mantara was the spindle and Vasuki, the snake, the rope for churning. Then they started churning the Ocean with the Rakshasas (Asuras) holding the head of the snake and the Devas holding the tail of the snake. The churning went on for a very long time and Vishnu encouraged the participants to work tirelessly. He also ensured that the spindle got stabilized by pressing it. As a result of the churning, many objects came out such as the cow, elephant, horse, Akshaya patra (pot of plenty), God of Medicine, Goddess of Wealth, gems etc and finally Amrita. Also, a deadly poison emerged which was swallowed by Lord Siva to save the world. The Devas appropriated many of the items that emerged for themselves which angered the Asuras. Even in the distribution of Amrita, Vishnu took the form of Mohini to lure Asuras and cunningly ensured that the Devas were the beneficiaries.</p>
 <p>According to the Vishnu Purana, Sage Durvasa met Indra seated on Iravat (celestial elephant) and presented him with a garland. Indra placed the garland on the head of the elephant and it threw the garland to the ground and trampled it. Seeing this, Durvasa got very angry and cursed Indra. Subsequently, Indra lost his wealth and the Devas went to Vishnu, seeking his help to solve the problem. After listening to them, Vishnu said that wealth had to be churned out of the Milky Ocean. This, however, could not be achieved without the co-operation of the Asuras. As Asuras also had a similar problem, they agreed to co-operate with the Devas and churn the Milky Ocean together. Both the parties started churning the ocean by using Mount Mantara as the spindle, and Vasuki, the great snake, as the rope for churning. During the churning, Vishnu took the form of a giant turtle and supported the mountain. The churning produced the desired result and many useful products emerged. Finally Amrita came out of the Ocean. After the churning was over, a quarrel ensued between the Asuras and Devas over the sharing of treasures churned out of the Ocean. Vishnu took the form of Mohini to entice the Asuras and ensured that the Devas got the lion’s share including Amrita. Subsequently, Indra regained his wealth.</p>
 <p>If I remember right, the third version is from Padma Purana which follows the Durvasa line as the cause of the churning and which mentions that Mount Meru was used as the spindle.</p>
 <p>Obviously, when one looks at such stories with the mindset of a secular non-believer, they may be dismissed as unbelievable or sheer nonsense. If an ignorant person looks at tons and tons of earth mined from a gold mine, the presence of gold will not be apparent to him. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a ready-made key to unlock the secrets of such unbelievable stories. Therefore, in the first place, let us discuss a few points which will help us to extract useful information from the different versions of the story.</p>
 <p>The first contradiction in the story is about the cause which made the people churn Milky Ocean. In one version, Sage Durvasa gave a curse to Indra which made him lose all his wealth, because the elephant that Indra was riding trampled the garland offered by the sage. One of the important products that came out of the churning was the elephant, which became the mount for Indra. Therefore, how can the elephant be present before the start of the churning? Obviously, the story has been spun to make it interesting. Durvasa is always portrayed as an angry rishi and whenever a story writer wants a curse to be uttered, he uses the name of Durvasa. It was Durvasa who cursed Indra at one time, Sakuntala at some other time and was tricked by Lord Krishna before he could curse Draupadi. It is worth noticing that the three events took place at times separated by thousands of years and therefore, the story teller or writer used the name of Durvasa probably to portray the curse as a powerful one. Even today, we can see how the media people twist things to make stories sensational. Therefore, by a suitable filtering process we can discount the Durvasa story and understand that some difficulty was envisaged rather than a curse.</p>
 <p>The difficulty could have been caused by very low temperatures around 20,000 years ago when the mercury dropped to the lowest point during the last Ice age. Because of the climatic conditions, the availability of vegetable products for gathering and animals for hunting might have reached the lowest levels. Also, the early humans were very much obsessed with ways and means of increasing their population. This, probably, resulted in the desired results and population went on growing. Naturally, the resources of the hunter-gatherer society came under strain and they naturally explored the ways and means to overcome the difficulty. Lord Vishnu gave his wise counsel to produce things with the co-operation of Asuras. Even though the process adopted was called ‘churning of the Ocean’ it was only an euphemism for ‘productive activity’. This is explicit from the statement that the churning went on for thousand years. Obviously `churning of milk’ cannot go on for that long and it was only a sort of revolution to bring out new products and processes for the first time in human history to overcome the shortage of essentials for the hunter-gatherer society.</p>
 <p>Talking of contradictions in the Puranic story, there are many that we can identify: Firstly, it is unbelievable that an ocean with milk can ever exist. Surely, at some point of time, they were aware of the ‘Milky Way’ and this could have led them to believe in milky oceans. Secondly, whether the ocean was a milky one or not is not clear as Saint Andal, in her devotional songs, refers to it as the Bay of Bengal. Then again the spindle used was quoted as Mount Mantara in some versions and Mount Meru in other versions. Can a hunter-gatherer society have enough knowledge or expertise to move and churn a mountain? In some versions of the story, Lord Vishnu took the form of a tortoise and supported the mountain. In other versions, he pressed the mountain and stabilized the churning. Therefore, we have to filter out certain aspects of the story and find out the truth about what led to the spinning of such a story.</p>
 <p>Let us now discuss a possible narrative which could be believed. It was probably the first time when the hunter-gatherer society faced a resource crunch. The senior leader advised the quarrelling Devas and Asuras to patch up their differences and work together to get over the difficult situation. They heeded his advice and got the help of the Nagas. They started an activity which produced the desired results viz. to ensure greater availability of essentials and also-by-products such as wine, weapons etc. for all the communities. Therefore, this activity seems to be a major activity done by hunter-gatherers transforming them into farming communities enjoying the bliss of settled life. If this actually happened, it was nothing else but the Neolithic Revolution that we are looking for to explain the sudden transformations at Jericho, Mehrgarh, China and Spirit Cave. The place where it happened can also be pinpointed as and when we know the areas where the Devas and Asuras lived.</p>
 <p>One of the objects to come out of the churning process was the ‘wish-fulfilling’ celestial cow, known as Kamadhenu. I see this as an event when the cow was domesticated. For a hunter-gatherer society, domesticating an animal was certainly an epoch-making event. When they fully domesticated an animal, it gave milk and many other products that were produced from milk. For a primitive society of hunter-gatherers, what they achieved was of very great significance and when they described the event they naturally exaggerated the event and pictured the animal as one which could give them everything they wanted. Stories were naturally built up on this theme and ascribed Godliness to the whole process which was inevitable in such societies. After domesticating the cattle, they were able to domesticate the elephant and the horse which were also products of the great churning of the milky ocean.</p>
 <p>One of the most interesting items to come out of the churning was Kalpa Vriksha, the ‘desire-manifesting’ tree. Even though the story may indicate an exaggerated view, I see in the story a clear cut indication of development of agricultural and horticultural activities for the first time by a hunter-gatherer society. In other words, it can be called domestication of plants. When such a primitive society could get desired agricultural products by planting seedlings it was probably one of the greatest advances made by the society. This agricultural event coupled with animal husbandry would have made the society gain prosperity.</p>
 <p>Another major item they got was the pot of plenty, the Akshaya Patra. Probably, the primitive society, before the creative activity, had only containers provided by nature and therefore, very limited. The creative activity taught them how to make earthern pots. In these pots they could store things which otherwise would have gone to waste. Further, now that they had learnt to milk the cows, they needed vessels to store the milk and also for churning to get butter. Therefore, quite rightly, they called the mud pot coming out of the churning ‘akshaya patra’.</p>
 <p>The other items that came out of the churning was Saranga, the bow, and Panchajanya the conch. The invention of the bow and arrow must have been a major boost for hunting animals. This made the hunting process much safer for the hunter. The discovery and utilization of the conch was of very great significance. It signifies the production and amplification of sound. It would have increased the communication level among humans. Probably it was also a harbinger for producing different types of sounds which would have helped in the development of language and music. In view of the enormous significance of the discovery, the conch became an object of worship and Lord Vishnu holds one all the time.</p>
 <p>There are also many items of pleasure that came out of this great ‘churning’ activity. The emergence of nymphs, like Rambha, heralds the emergence of artistic activity. When a group works hard to achieve something, it also needs entertainment. This is what is indicated by the emergence of celestial nymphs who became dancers in the court of Indra. God of love, Kama, is also supposed to have come out of the churning. Probably, a further thrust was again given to increase the population. Another item of pleasure that came out of the churning was ‘sura’ which indicates that the population learnt the process to make alcoholic drinks.</p>
 <p>The God of Health, Danvanthri, was also a product of the churning. This means that this was the period when people started learning about medicines and how to use medicines for relief of illness. The ultimate result of the churning was, of course, Amrita - the nectar that would give immortality. I speculate that Amrita might have been a potent medicine against some disease prevalent at that time. Next in the list are the gems - Chintamani and Kaustrubum. We see the emergence of gems as an indication of the mining activity and pearl diving. Kumari area and South India have always been famous for pearl diving. Last, but not the least, was the emergence of Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity. When a society has been able to make advances in so many diverse fields by starting from scratch, it is truly with the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity.</p>
 <p>In one of the versions about the great churning, I read that the churning went on for thousand years. Such a long period is quite possible for a primitive hunter-gatherer society to acquire sufficient expertise not only to transform the society into a prosperous one but also to make the society a civilized one. It is this event, probably the Neolithic Revolution, that transformed the hunter-gatherers into settled farmers and also enabled them to undertake industrial activity.</p>
 <p>The first agricultural and industrial revolution of homosapiens over a period extending to almost a millennium or more should have uplifted the society in many ways. The most important fact in achieving this great feat was the emergence of the idea to organize, plan and involve enough number of people with required skills. Till the ‘churning of the ocean’, the humans were probably living as scattered tribes, sustained by raw nature. Even though the creative activity bestowed many benefits to the hunter-gatherers, it also produced pollution pictured metaphorically as the poison emitted during the churning. For the first time humans would have learnt that a very beneficial activity could also cause pollution. In the story, it is narrated that the poison (halahala) was swallowed by Lord Shiva and it was confined to his throat. Thus, he acquired a blue neck and he was henceforth known as Neelakanta. However, the real aspect of the story should have been that probably being the senior most, he took effective steps to control the pollution and became the first pollution control expert!</p>
 <p>Apart from pollution, there were other fallouts which are in no way desirable. The first one was the way in which the Asuras tried to snatch the container with the Amritha. It is also bad that they were denied the fruits of the churning. It made the Asuras, permanent enemies of the Devas. This can be envisaged as the conflict of the capitalists against the labourers or as the conflict between the rich and the poor or between the thinking-engineers and the skilled workers. Perhaps the Devas claimed a sort of patent right and took away most of what was produced. Whatever it was, the event widened the rift between the haves and the have nots which we still see in the modern world. Another bad thing seems to be the way in which the humans started becoming used to the luxurious life i.e. indulging in wine, women and other forms of pleasure. Indra, the King of Devas, is well known for such bad activities and many times he was cursed by sages for this.</p>
 <p>We also see intrigue in the matter of distribution. When the Asuras demand their rightful share, the Devas knew that they were quite powerful. Mohini, an avatar of Vishnu, was sent to mediate. It also shows that Asuras could be easily cheated. What I want to stress is that this is the same as the recent Industrial Revolution in Europe which divided the society into groups creating inimical feelings between each group. The first Industrial Revolution [churning of ocean] also divided the society into two groups. Even though the division and fight still go on, it is interesting to note that one group cannot survive without the existence of the other group.</p>
 <p>In the previous paragraphs, we have been able to identify a Puranic story which corresponds with the details of a possible Neolithic Revolution. While describing the event, we have suggested that the revolution was the work of the Devas, Asuras and Nagas who probably lived in the areas South of India. If the revolution had taken place near India, we should be able to convince the readers that the fruits of such revolution was largely reaped by the Indian population. If this is done, the proposition that ‘churning the ocean’ signifies the Neolithic Revolution, occurred near India gets additional support.</p>
 <p>The `Industrial Revolution’ in Europe was an event very similar to the `Neolithic Revolution’. Therefore, it would be reasonable to draw parallels between the two revolutions and learn more about them. We know very well that it is the ‘Industrial Revolution’ which helped the European countries to become economically strong leading to fantastic political strength to subjugate the whole world, even though this was for a short period of about two centuries. This superiority helped them to advance culturally making them to believe that they were the originators of everything. Therefore, if India had been the beneficiary of the ‘Neolithic Revolution’ it should have gained enormously in the economic and political field. For establishing this fact, let us see what modern authors have to say on this subject Swami Narayan Aksharpit has published a book in April 2006 titled ‘Hidden Horizons’ [unearthing 10,000 years of Indian culture]. The book is authored by David Frawley and N.S. Rajaram, and a very appropriate one for our purpose. In page 9 of the book there is a passage on India’s matchless cultural heritage, going back to many thousands of years. On the economic strength of India they have quoted Augus Madison as follows:</p>
 <p>According to economist Augus Maddison in “The World Economic: A Millineal Perspective”, the region that comprises the Indian subcontinent had the largest share of the world’s gross domestic product until the end of the 16th century [India was the richest for over 75% of world’s counted calendar history].</p>
 <p>A sitting Judge of the Supreme Court of India Markanday Katju, wrote two articles on the caste system which appeared in “The Hindu” dated “8th and 9th January 2009. He says “it is well known that before the coming of the British, India was one of the most prosperous countries of that time. In fact, India was once a super power with 31.5% share in global production”.</p>
 <p>Economic power naturally leads to political power. Therefore, let us briefly discuss the political power of India along with the associated expansion of Indian culture to other parts of the world. We shall start with the Chola emperors Raja Raja and Rajendra 1, and scan the historical horizon backwards to establish how India fared politically and culturally during the earlier periods. Raja Raja and his son were great Chola Emperors whose period was roughly 1000 years before now. They were very powerful and had sway over most of South East Asia. During their rule, the southern culture spread to many parts of South East Asia. At the time they had one of the strongest armies and a navy.</p>
 <p>The Chola Emperors reigned supreme during the last few centuries of the first millennium. Before them the powerful Pallavas of Kanchi ruled over large parts of South India. They were the first people to use stone for construction of temples and they were responsible for many architectural wonders including the Mahabalipuram temples (world heritage site). Readers will be quite familiar with Angkor wat in Combodia and many other temples in Khmer country. Most of the Khmer rulers were called Varmans. The Pallava kings were also called Vermans. Therefore, the Khmer country was largely influenced by happenings in South India. Most of the Khmer temples were either Hindu or Buddhist. It is said that the Khmer happily adopted Hinduism because they saw that Hindus were the most prosperous people of that time which they believed was due to the religion the Hindus followed. The temple architecture of most of the Khmer temples were derived from India. One can see the influence of Dravidian architecture in the form of the pyramidical structure of the Vimanam and the methodology in the construction of the temples. For example, Ta Prohm temple was built using stone as the only core material - a method which is called ‘Suddha’. The Big temple in Tanjavur and the Kailasanatha temple of Kanchi which were built earlier used this methodology. The vast ruins of Angkor are covered with sculptures of Indian myths and legends. If one looks at neighboring Thailand, the Khon, a classical dance accompanied by a recitation of Ramkein, the Thai version of the story of Indian God-hero Rama, is still performed. The story regarding the Indonesian archipelago is more interesting. In Java, the massive temple of Borobudur is carved with scenes from Indian Jataka tales. On the Island of Bali, 10,000 temples are dedicated to a localized form of Hinduism. All these go to prove that during the time of the Pallavas and Cholas, the vast area in South East Asia came under the strong influence of India in many ways. This could not have been achieved but for the economic, political and cultural strength of India. What is important to notice is that here was a civilization which had unbroken development for a long period till the time of Raja Raja. This implies that the technological and other developments were at their peak during his reign. The standing example today is the Brahadeeswara Temple in Tanjore built by Raja Raja.</p>
 <p>When we travel backwards in history from the rule of the Cholas and Pallavas, cultural superiority of India is evident when it established great Universities offering advanced education of the time for students from anywhere in the world. The most important one of these universities was the Nalanda University which was established around 5th century A.D. More than 10,000 students studied in that great University and the students came from many other countries. Many students came from China and the well known Huan Swang stayed and studied in Nalanda for 5 years. The students studied religion,philosophy, astronomy, the Vedas, medicine, logic history etc. Unfortunately, such a great institution was destroyed in 1098 by Muslim invaders.</p>
 <p>Before Nalanda, the major landmark in Indian history was the Maurya Dynasty. Ashoka was a very great Emperor of India belonging to this dynasty and his peaceful conquest of many countries towards the East of India is well known. This certainly shows the cultural superiority of India during his time. After the Kalinga war, he shunned violence even though he controlled most parts of India. His grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya was a very great Eastern monarch who was able to check the Greek influence on India. He is reported to have confronted Alexander’s General Seluccus and in a compromise, Chandraguptha gained control of parts of Afganisthan. He is also reported to have married the daughter of Seluccus. His political power extended to most parts of India. He was ably assisted by a shrewd Brahmin, Kautilya, who was generally called Machiavelli of India. Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, authroed a manual of politics (Arthashastra). Almost 1800 years later, Machiavelli wrote “The Prince” which reads like the Arthashastra. Therefore, it is very strange that Chanakya is called Machiavelli of India.</p>
 <p>Even though there were many powerful kingdoms in India, I have mentioned only some of them because it is during their time that India’s culture spread far and wide. If Chanakya could anticipate Machiavelli 1800 years earlier, it is very easy to understand how advanced the Indian civilization was even before the Christian era. Another important aspect of the Indian cultural conquest was that it was a peaceful one. Chandragupta’s time was around 300 B.C. Before Chandragupta, it was the Indus Valley civilization which covered a very large area and it was certainly bigger than the contemporary civilizations of Egypt and Sumer. There were very able engineers who were responsible for building well planned towns and also many types of industry. They built the famous sea port at Lothal and built beautiful cities like Dolavira. Industrial activity was flourishing and there was considerable maritime trading activity. All these required standardization which was done well. The standardization rules were enforced over a very vast area and for long periods of time. This certainly meant a strong central political organization whose dictate was enforced over such a vast area. How communication was maintained during the period may well remain a mystery. This is the time when early scripts were emerging. At the same time, there was fantastic development of scientific knowledge such as astronomy, medicine etc. The crowning achievement of the time was the compilation of the Vedas which shows their advanced philosophies.</p>
 <p>Further they never left anything to chance and this resulted in inventing a system for the transmission of the Vedas from generation to generation. It is because of the genius of the people who devised the method we can hear the Vedas in the same manner as they were chanted on the banks of the Saraswathi. The caste system and the oral transmission of Vedas et. have not only preserved the knowledge they developed but also ensured its continuous improvement. Whether we back track from Raja Raja to Kumari age or we travel forward from Kumari to Raja Raja, the Kumari civilization had an unbroken development for a long time. It is the only civilization which was the mother of all civilizations of the world. Therefore, the Neolithic revolution around 10,000 years ago, which has been mentioned earlier, must have its origins only in Kumari.</p>
 <p>The cultural heritage of India is unbroken for very long periods of time and certainly for the period starting from the Neolithic Revolution up till today. Therefore, the traces of Neolithic Revolution should be lingering in some form. The cow was the first animal to be domesticated and it is praised by the Hindus as the ‘all giving’ Kamadhenu with divine attributes. The beauty of Indian culture is that it remembers the various factors which enabled them to advance culturally and a feeling of gratefulness is evident in many such instances. One of the best cases is the help from the cow for human advancement after the Neolithic Revolution. The cow is an inseparable part of Indian culture and it is anathema for a Hindu to harm a cow. The Hindus, even today, worship the cow as the Mother goddess. Cows are gifted to the Hindu temples and they become part of the temples. The products derived from the cow are given when a high order of purification is needed. Before a Hindu enters his newly built house, the first to enter the house will be the cow. There are many go-shalas where old cows are looked after. Milk products are extensively used in rituals. Therefore, it is so nice to feel that at least some Hindus still regard cows as part and parcel of their life and culture. Similarly, the elephant also has a high place. Most of the major temples in South India have elephants and Gaja pooja is one of the important poojas along with Gopuja.</p>
 <p>As stated earlier, Akshaya Patra refers to the earthen pot which was the first vessel to be made by man. Even today, pottery articles are used in Hindu rituals such as marriage, death ceremonies etc. When I was young, I knew some of my orthodox relatives cooked their food only in mud pots. Indian society has not forgotten the importance of mud pots and they are still in use.</p>
 <p>Let us now consider the Kalpatharu or the ‘wish giving’ tree. Even now the coconut tree is called Kalpavruksha. It is still given a high place in the society, similar to that of the cow. No real Hindu will ever kill a cow, similarly, no Hindu will ever cut a coconut tree as it is called Kalpavruksha. Its benefit to the early society is still remembered and the tree is respected as much as the cow. The coconut tree is an interesting example of ‘living history’. It is called ‘Thennai’ in Tamil meaning, the one that came from the South. Therefore, it was not native to South India and brought from the South of India later. Also it is clear that the coconut tree was domesticated in the southern part of the Indian Ocean which does not exist today. The case of this particular tree not only indicates the existence of Kumari but also the fact that it was domesticated there and therefore, it is identifying the place where the Neolithic Revolution took place.</p>
 <p>Coconut is grown mostly in the southern part of the subcontinent apart from Sri Lanka and Nicobar Islands. Coconut forms an integral part of Hindu social life and is used in Hindu rituals in the South. It is an essential part of Poojas and marriage ceremonies, and it is customary to give coconuts to all invites who attend a marriage. Similarly, when friends visit, they are given coconuts in `most’ of the households. Just like the cow, the coconut and mud pots are an integral part of Hindu society with divinity attached to them. This clearly affirms that the society remembers the enormous benefits to the society from these items. Last but not the least, we shall come to the Conch which is a very holy item for the Hindus and it is used in many rituals.</p>
 <p>In conclusion, we can boldly affirm that the place of the Neolithic Revolution which is estimated to have occurred around 10,000 years ago is certainly the Kumari continent, remnants of which existed around the time. When the remaining parts of Kumari started vanishing into the sea after the end of the last Ice age, people with the new knowledge shifted to different parts of the world, mainly through sea routes as explained earlier.</p>
 <p>The biggest religious congregation in the world is Kumbhmela in Allahabad which is held once in twelve years at Triveni Sangam, the confluence of two visible rivers, the Ganga and the Yamuna and the invisible river known as the Saraswathi. I would call this a commemorative event held once in twelve years to remember the most important revolution in the history of modern humans. Our ancients were probably addicted to the 12 year cycle which is the time Jupiter takes to go around the Sun. When we know the size of the congregation and the fervour with which rituals are observed during the period, it clearly means that it meant something of utmost significance to humanity.</p>
 <p>We have seen earlier in this chapter that the pot of nectar known as Amritha Kumbha emerged after churning the Milky Ocean. When this happened, the Asuras tried to snatch the Kumbha form the Suras. It was the son of Indra, known as Jayantha, who is reported to have carried the Kumba to Devalokha hotly pursued by the Asuras. According to the legend, the process of carrying the pot took twelve Deva days which is equivalent to twelve human years. During the process of carrying the pot, Amrita got spilt at four places which were Prayag (Allahabad), Hardwar, Ujjain and Nasik. Therefore, the Kumbha Mela is held once in twelve years at these four places by turn.</p>
 <p>What a fine way to commemorate a major event in human history known as Neolithic Revolution (Samudra Mathana). In spite of the lapse of ten thousand years or more since the event took place, if we still continue to commemorate the event, it speaks loudly about the genius of our ancients who devised a method so that humanity for ever remembers the event, and the importance of the event to humanity.</p>
 <p>Neolithic Revolution started more than 10,000 years ago and during the first few thousands of years there have been significant achievements which transformed the hunter-gatherer society completely. The spirit of the first revolution is still with modern humans and probably the development that started 10,000 years ago are still continuing. This will be apparent from Table-2 which gives the results of Samudra Manthana, what it meant by the Neolithic Revolution and what is the present status of each and every developmental activity. In other words, the humans started tinkering with nature 10,000 years ago and the tinkering is still going on. Certainly, the event uplifted `modern humans’ to unprecedented levels.</p>
 <p>One of the most famous creations of Khmer art in Cambodia can be seen on the exterior walls of Angkor Wat. The Scene depicting the ‘churning of the Milky Ocean’ is given the same importance as the scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The scene is depicted on a panel which is 50 metres in length and 2 metres in height. This re-inforces our ideas about the importance given to the ‘Churning of the Ocean’.</p>
