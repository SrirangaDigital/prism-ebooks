		<p>I remember having read that Braj Basi Lal, a Director General of Archeological Survey of India, excavated an ancient site in Rajastan known as Kalibangan. He found a field of furrows, dated around 3000 B.C. Later, he was amazed to find that the present day farmers of the area also used a similar technique, even after 5000 years. Further, he also established that the ancient houses had tandoors (earthern ovens) similar to the present day ones in the area. This important finding made him exclaim “it was as if the present was the past”.</p>
		<p>The above observation made by the Director General has always been in my mind and many times I used to wonder how nice it would be if I were able to identify a technology which would have been practiced in the same way some five, ten or twenty thousand years ago. I was very lucky to get such an opportunity when my working place got shifted to a different location in Bangalore. To reach my new office, I had to drive through two major roads, one known as K.R. Road and the other known as Magadi Road. On K.R. Road, I used to see the same scenes I have been seeing for almost 60 years without paying any special attention about their significance.</p>
		<p>However, Lal’s observation had made a deep impact on me and slowly the same scenes which I have been seeing for many decades started having a new meaning. There are about a dozen families on K.R. Road [and a couple on Magadi Road] who have taken to bamboo work for a living One of the items is a bamboo mat which is usually used as a curtain in houses and offices. They use a very simple weaving technique shown in the Fig 2.2. The total equipment consists of 3 bamboo poles, ropes and stones as weights. Whenever they add a new bamboo strip, they cross over the stones to get the weaving pattern.</p>
		<p>In the beginning, they might have used any wooden stick in place of bamboo, dry reeds in place of bamboo strips and ropes from agricultural waste. The most important part of the process is the idea to cross over the stones to get the weaving pattern. The change-over to bamboo might have occurred later as it needs better tools. What is important here is the technology for holding the reeds together, and we should consider ourselves very lucky to see the same techonology today as was practised probably more than ten thousand years ago.</p>
		<p>The activity seen on K.R. Road tells us many things about ancient history which we cannot comprehend in any other manner. As explained earlier, the industrial activity seen on K.R. Road depends only on materials that were available in ancient times except some tool made of stone or other materials which modern humans developed around 60,000 years ago. Further, artisans in India grow within families and the technology gets transmitted from father to son for many, many generations. Therefore, we can confirm that the observed activity is almost a replica of what happened 10 thousand years ago. Rather, it leads me to think that what I have seen is ‘living history’ similar to the one seen by Lal in Kalibangan. Here, I remember what the eminent historian Kosambi had said. According to him, “if you go into the Indian country side you can actually see survivals of cultural and social forms that might have existed earlier”.</p>
		<p>Secondly, as the activity is a family one for untold generations, we can conclude that the origin of this particular activity is South India or a nearby area from where people migrated to South India at the end of the last Ice age. As this technological development could be considered as part of the Neolithic Revolution, it naturally leads us to conclude that the origin of the revolution should have been at the land mass South of India from where the population migrated around 10,000 years ago after the end of the last Ice age. It would have been the primitive methods, similar to the ones seen on K.R. Road, that would have given birth to the textile technology for which India was famous till the British arrived.</p>
		<p>In Fig 2.2. there are three photographs. The top one shows the arrangement necessary for the job. There are two sets of stones hanging on either side of the horizontal bamboo. The worker stands on one side and alternate stones hang on either side, the near side and the far side. The bamboo strip is placed on top of the horizontal bamboo and the stones are crossed over, near side ones to the far side and far side ones to the near side. This process holds the bamboo strip firmly and the process is continued step by step by placing another strip and crossing over the stones till the desired length of the mat is woven.</p>
		<p>The middle photograph shows a half finished product and the bottom photograph shows the family members engaged in the enterprise. One can easily see the three generations involved in this activity which strengthens my suggestion that this is not only ‘living history’ of a very early invention but also the process by which the enterprise has been kept alive for thousands and thousands of years as a family venture.</p>

		<p>While discussing religion in a later section, I have explained that in modern Bangalore one can easily see the most ancient religious practices of early Mother worship and bizarre rituals. If one travels, further down towards the Southern tip of India, the rituals will remind one of much earlier times when it originated. Therefore, India is the hot spot of ‘living history’ where one can learn many things. Here I am reminded of the statement of Micheal Wood that India is the only place that has incorporated the modern without rejecting the old. Therefore, it is a matter for regret that very little attention has been paid to the evidence available in India for understanding pre-history.</p>
