		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">COASTAL MIGRATION THEORY</h1>
		<p>The ‘Coastal Migration Theory’ gets generated as follows. Australia is a unique place where evidence of hominids other than modern humans is not available. Therefore, it has to be presumed that the modern humans would have come to Australia from somewhere else. Further, it has been recently established that Australia was probably occupied by modern humans around 60,000 years ago. Assuming that at that time Africa was the only place where modern humans lived, it would be reasonable to postulate that the African population migrated to Australia as genetic evidence exists for the split of the African population around that period. If we want to establish, without any archeological evidence that modern humans migrated from Africa to Australia around 60,000 years ago, it can be done only through a speculative theory.</p>
		<p>Even though there is no concrete evidence, it is assumed that the African population experienced shortage of food around 60,000 years ago and migrated to coastal regions and they got used to the food available in the coastal region. Further, it is assumed that the coast offered a super highway for migration from Africa to Australia. Fig 3.1 gives a rough idea of the imaginary route followed by the coastal migrants. As we can see, it starts somewhere in Africa, follows the Eastern coast of Africa till it reaches, probably, Arabia. The route again starts from Aden and runs along the East coast of Arabia till it reaches the coastline of Iran. Again it follows the coastline of Pakistan and follows the West coast of India. The route continues through the South Indian Coast, reaches Indonesia and then New Guinea and finally ends up in Australia.</p>

		<p>The Y Marker associated with the Coastal Theory is M130. The marker is seen at a low frequency of 5% in India, 10% in Malaysia, 15% in New Guinea and more than 50% in Australia among very early inhabitants. It is also the dominant marker in many Eastern countries particularly China, Mongolia, Eastern Siberia etc. Marker M130 could also be called the Mongolian marker. The only evidence for the Coastal Migration seems to be presence of Marker M130 in the coastal route to Australia beyond India. As M130 is not seen in the route till it reaches India, it is assumed that M130 arose during the coastal journey. Therefore, this evidence needs confirmation from other sources. Unfortunately, as against this single supportive evidence, there are concrete evidence to prove the Coastal Theory wrong.</p>
		<p>Archeological excavations at Jwalapuram in the Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh (India) cast serious doubts on the assertion that no modern humans lived outside Africa until at least 60,000 years ago. The excavation of Jwalapuram was carried out by an international team of scientists. The team has found evidence that anatomically modern humans are likely to have reached India before a massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia. The “Super eruption” of Toba volcano in Sumatra, which was the largest volcanic event during the last two million years, occurred some 74,000 years ago. During the five years of excavation, British, Australian and Indian scientists unearthed fine stone tools which were found in the layers of Earth above as well as below the fine ash from the Toba super-eruption, confirming the presence of modern humans before the Toba event.</p>
		<p>According to Michael Petraglia of Cambridge University, the tools were similar to the ones produced in Africa at the same time. Further, it is stated that these tools in Africa had been produced by modern humans. Dr. Petraglia is reported to have stated “so what we are seeing is that the modern humans probably dispersed from Africa into India at a very early date, earlier than anyone has suggested”. Also, Ravi Korisettar of Karnataka University is reported to be skeptical about modern humans opting for a coastal route for their migration. Therefore, based on this single evidence, the Coastal Migration Theory seems to be a non-starter.</p>
		<p>Next, let us take up the presence of apes in Asia and Africa and see whether it contributes to the ‘Out of Africa Theory’. At present, gorillas and chimpanzees are found in Africa whereas gibbons and orangutans are found only in Asia. Even though the orangutan is a very early ancestor of the modern humans, it has striking similarities to modern humans. Some scientists even favoured the idea that the most likely ancestor of modern humans may be the gibbons. However, the recent view on the subject seems to be that chimpanzees are our ancestors. The apes we have mentioned above have a single genetic lineage extending down to modern humans from the orangutan, our earlier root. While discussing the genetic data of modern humans in Africa, it was unambiguously proposed that the deepest roots are in Africa and therefore modern humans should have evolved in Africa. If we apply the same logic it is clear that the deepest roots for apes are in Asia and therefore, they should have evolved in Asia and not Africa. In such a case modern humans also might have evolved in the Asian area such as Kumari and easily traveled to Australia again proving that the Coastal Theory wrong.</p>
		<p>The worst blow for the ‘Coastal Migration Theory’ comes from the fact that archeology has failed to support the theory as there is not a single archeological evidence throughout the long winding coastal route. Further, nature prefers a radial direction for dispersal, and animals and early humans might not have been an exception to this mode of dispersal. Therefore, it is highly improbable that a primitive people who feared the unknown and who lacked any sort of navigational sense to undertake a travel covering almost half the world, could have chosen an impassable route. Western scientists are very fond of Ockham’s razor and why it was not used in the case of the Coastal Theory will for ever remain a mystery. In layman’s language, Ockham’s statement means that if you want to fly from Bombay to Chennai, you can go to Delhi then to Calcutta and then reach Chennai but everyone will prefer only to fly by the direct route. It also means that nature never operates superfluously. Africa is a huge continent and the human population around 60,000 years ago was quite small. The huge African continent would have had enough resources to feed a small population. If the humans had felt some difficulty in one area, the most natural dispersal should have been within the continent.</p>
