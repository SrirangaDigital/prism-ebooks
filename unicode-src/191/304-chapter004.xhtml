		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">SEA LEVELS</h1>
<p>One of the most controversial area of climatic sciences is how the seas are likely to rise in a warmer world. If the ice sheets in the polar regions, excluding East Antarctic, were to melt it would raise the sea level by more than 12 metres. The East Antarctic ice sheet alone holds enough water to raise sea levels by about 60 metres.</p>
 <p>In order to get more information on the subject I visited the NASA website GCMD. James Hausen, a prominent NASA scientist, predicted the likelihood that the Earth will pass a tipping point resulting in the sea level rising by up to a metre every 20 years. The trigger for this is an extra degree of global warming resulting in the runaway melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. This is surely an alarming warning but it can give us a rough idea of the possibility of significant rise in sea levels which might have occurred in the olden days.</p>
 <p>Amidst these uncertain and even alarming possibilities, Spencer Wells (Page 78, Journey of Man) gives a comforting estimate that around 50,000 years ago, the sea levels were around 100 metres lower than they are today. He also states that “a difference of 100 metres in sea level can make a huge difference in the area of land exposed” translating into “an extra expose of as much as 200 Km of land off the west coast of India”.</p>
 <p>In order to predict sea levels around 60,000 years ago or 200,000 years ago, a lot of hard work is needed with suitable funding. I hope the exercise will be taken up one day, even though not immediately. In the meantime, we should have at least a very rough idea of the unsubmerged land area of Kumari Kandam say around 200,000 years ago. The best way is to begin with the sea depths as given in any atlas. If we leave out areas where the sea is deeper, then we get a rough picture as shown in Fig. 3.2. The white area indicates relatively low sea depths and therefore parts of the white area may have been habitable area at some time during the past 200,000 years. From the computer simulation, we shall be able to judge when the seven islands mentioned in the Puranas existed. From other indications, the period when the seven islands exsisted might have been between 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. I understand some work has been done in the past in this direction. Readers must clearly understand that at any time during the past the exposed area would have been very much less than the white area shown in the map. The white area has been continuously shrinking to almost nothing except for the Antarctic and islands like Chagos Andamans etc. and ridges like Seychelles, Mauratius, Laccadive Chagos etc.,</p>
 <p>Now let us take up the thread in the Puranas where it is stated that there were seven islands. This information probably pertains to a period just before the end of the last Ice age because people who wrote the Puranas had the collective memory of the places from where they came. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that people were living in some of those islands before they migrated to India. If this is so, there should have been some major islands in the Indian Ocean before the end of the last Ice age and subsequently, they were lost to the sea which necessitated the migration of peole around 10,000 years ago. If we extend the time horizon to cover a longer period, say 60,000 years, some of those islands were probably connected to each other and probably had connections to Africa. That is the time all modern humans lived on a continuous landmass which extended from Africa up to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>
 <p>A study of sea levels has certainly helped us to get convinced scientifically, that there must have been sizeable unsubmerged land areas in the Indian Ocean adding enormous weight to the idea of Kumari Kandam as mentioned in ancient Tamil literature.</p>
