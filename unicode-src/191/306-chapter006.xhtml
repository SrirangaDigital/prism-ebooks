<p>Earlier, we saw that the orangutans and the gibbons are now
found, only in Asia, i.e. Indonesia, Malaysia etc., and not in
Africa. Similarly, gorillas and chimps live only in Africa and
not in Asia. As they are all of the same lineage there should
have been a common place from where they all evolved. To
get confirmation for this idea, I investigated the presence of old
world monkeys and the Loris family. They are now found in
three isolated pockets in Africa, India and South East Asia. Fig.
3.3 gives the natural range of old world monkeys and
Fig. 3.4 gives the natural range of the Loris super family. A
look at these figures clearly indicates that these two groups must
have lived on the Central land mass in the Indian Ocean which
had land connections to Africa, India and S.E. Asia. When
the land connection vanished due to the rise in the sea level,
the animals would have got isolated in those three pockets. This
fact indirectly confirms that Kumari Continent existed sometime
in the past. In order to get more support for the idea, I also
studied the migration of cats and dogs and they also show a
strong proof that they too could have had a similar origin.</p>
<p>Till recently, it was believed that wolves were of North
American origin. Genetic studies, however, show that the
wolves were in India at least one million years ago. This
revelation is due to the work done by Yandvendradev Jhala of
Wildlife Institute of India (Dehradun). Ramesh Agarwal and
Lalji Singh of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology
(Hyderabad). Their conclusion is that wolves evolved near
India and not in North America. The Hyderabad group
compared twenty one wolves in the Darjeeling Zoo. R.C.
Fleisher of Smithsonian Institute compared the genetic clocks
of 700 wolves from India, Middle East and North America.
Both groups came to similar conclusions that all this happened
a million year ago when the Himalaya was young. As it has
been proved that wolves had migrated to different parts of the
world from India, India or near by landmass must have been
the cradle of wolf evolution.</p>
<p>There is also some useful information about the migration
of cats based on the research conducted by Warren E. Johnson
and Stephen J. O Brien of the National Cancer Institute and
colleagues elsewhere. According to them, sea levels were low
from one million to six million years ago enabling the first
modern cats to spread from Asia to the West and Africa
creating the caracal lineage and generating the ocelot, lynx and
puma lineages. This again reinforces the theory that life
originated in the landmass in the Indian Ocean near India and
spread all over the world.</p>
