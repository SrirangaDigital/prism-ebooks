		<p>Earlier, we saw that the orangutans and the gibbons are now found, only in Asia, i.e. Indonesia, Malaysia etc., and not inAfrica. Similarly, gorillas and chimps live only in Africa andnot in Asia. As they are all of the same lineage there shouldhave been a common place from where they all evolved. Toget confirmation for this idea, I investigated the presence of oldworld monkeys and the Loris family. They are now found inthree isolated pockets in Africa, India and South East Asia. Fig.3.3 gives the natural range of old world monkeys andFig. 3.4 gives the natural range of the Loris super family. Alook at these figures clearly indicates that these two groups musthave lived on the Central land mass in the Indian Ocean whichhad land connections to Africa, India and S.E. Asia. Whenthe land connection vanished due to the rise in the sea level,the animals would have got isolated in those three pockets. Thisfact indirectly confirms that Kumari Continent existed sometimein the past. In order to get more support for the idea, I alsostudied the migration of cats and dogs and they also show a strong proof that they too could have had a similar origin.</p>
		<p>Till recently, it was believed that wolves were of NorthAmerican origin. Genetic studies, however, show that thewolves were in India at least one million years ago. Thisrevelation is due to the work done by Yandvendradev Jhala ofWildlife Institute of India (Dehradun). Ramesh Agarwal andLalji Singh of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology(Hyderabad). Their conclusion is that wolves evolved nearIndia and not in North America. The Hyderabad groupcompared twenty one wolves in the Darjeeling Zoo. R.C.Fleisher of Smithsonian Institute compared the genetic clocksof 700 wolves from India, Middle East and North America.Both groups came to similar conclusions that all this happeneda million year ago when the Himalaya was young. As it hasbeen proved that wolves had migrated to different parts of theworld from India, India or near by landmass must have been the cradle of wolf evolution.</p>
		<p>There is also some useful information about the migrationof cats based on the research conducted by Warren E. Johnsonand Stephen J. O Brien of the National Cancer Institute andcolleagues elsewhere. According to them, sea levels were lowfrom one million to six million years ago enabling the firstmodern cats to spread from Asia to the West and Africacreating the caracal lineage and generating the ocelot, lynx andpuma lineages. This again reinforces the theory that lifeoriginated in the landmass in the Indian Ocean near India and spread all over the world.</p>
