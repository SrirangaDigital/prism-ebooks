		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">SARASWATHI CIVILIZATION</h1>
		<p>During the early decades of the 20th century, the nameSaraswathi meant Goddess Saraswathi, the consort of Brahma,who is the creator among the Hindu Trinity of Gods. As ayoungster, I remember that before the start of any theatricaldrama, one of the deities who always appeared on the stagewas Saraswathi seated on a white lotus and holding a veena.The starting point would be an invocation to the Goddess. Thena conversation between Vidushaka (jester) and the Goddesswould begin where he would ask some difficult questions tothe Goddess evoking laughter amongst the audience. Saraswathiwas also a synonym for knowledge and any material connectedwith learning was considered Saraswathi. Extending these ideas,even a piece of paper was considered Saraswathi and if onewalks over a piece of paper inadvertently, he should touch thepaper and his eyes to show respect to the paper which isSaraswathi. Whenever there was talk about the Kumbha Melaat Triveni Sangam in Allahabad, we were told that the Sangamwas the confluence of visible rivers Ganga and Yamuna andthe invisible Saraswathi. Even now, many Indians know aboutonly one Saraswathi river which is the invisible entity at Triveniand not the real one that existed as described in the Vedas.</p>
		<p>Saraswathi is mentioned more than 60 times in the Vedasand adored as Ambi Tame, Nadi Tame and Devi Tame - thebest of mothers, the best of rivers and the best of Goddesses- whereas the Ganga is mentioned very rarely. This has beena subject of discussion among A.I.T supporters and prominentIndian scholars. The A.I.T supporters pointed out that theSaraswathi mentioned in the Vedas was actually the Haraxvati,an insignificant stream in Afghanistan. However, as far backas 1886, R.J. Oldham of the Geological Survey of Indiaidentified Saraswathi as a great river lying between the Yamunaand the Sutlej which existed in ancient times. Unfortunately,Oldhamâ€™s work was ignored because of the political supportenjoyed by A.I.T protagonists. It is only during the last 60 yearsand the recent decades that more evidence regarding the existenceof an ancient mighty river came to light.</p>
		<p>After the partition in 1947, the known Indus sites went toPakistan. Naturally, a feverish hunt began in India to find outsimilar sites. Pakistan also joined the race and the efforts ofthe two nations paid rich dividends. Almost 500 sites werelocated in Pakistan and more than double that number in India.When all the sites identified in both the countries were plottedon a map, a new picture emerged. There was a cluster of sitesalong the dry Ghaggar river in Haryana and Rajasthan. Thecourse of the Ghaggar river in Pakistan is known as Hakra andit finally empties into the Rann of Kutch. There are sites alongHakra also but the sites along Ghaggar are more. (See Fig 4.1)</p>
		<p>First, it was a puzzle as to why so many humanhabitations came up along the dry Ghaggar-Hakra river and itstributaries. As flowing rivers are the life-line of civilization,it was realized that at some earlier time, a mighty river musthave flowed perennially through Ghaggar-Hakra. Naturally, thisleads one to the conclusion that in ancient time, the riverSarswathi (mentioned in the sacred hymns) could have flowedthrough the paleo channel of Ghagger-Hakra. Direct evidenceabout the Saraswathi river was obtained by satellites launchedby NASA and ISRO during 1978. The satellite pictures of thearea showed traces of ancient river courses, known as paleochannels, between the Sutlej and the Yamuna which correspondsto the Saraswathi river described in the Vedas. The width ofthe river ranged from 3 to 10 kilometers, confirming the largesize of the river. The course of the Saraswathi is plotted inFig 4.1. Here it will be worth pointing out that Nadi Sutraplaces Saraswathi between the Yamuna and the Shutudri (Sutlej).Apart from Rig Veda, Saraswathi is also mentioned inBrahmanas and Mahabharata. If such a mighty river had existedin ancient times what were the reasons for its drying up?</p><figure>	<img src="images/0013.jpg" alt="image" />			<figcaption>Fig 4.1 Appropriate area covered by Indus-Saraswathi Civilisation</figcaption></figure><p>In the Rig Veda, the Saraswathi is mentioned as flowingdown from the mountains to the Sea. This must have beenthe situation several centuries before 3000 B.C. During thoseearly days, both the Sutlej and the Yamuna flowed into theSaraswathi. It is postulated that sometime before 3000 B.C.,due to tectonic shifts caused by earthquakes, the Yamunachanged its course and flowed into the Ganga. This reducedthe flow into the Saraswathi at the upper reaches of the river.It seems that archeologists have found signs of atleast oneearthquake during this period. When the flow of the upperSaraswathi weakened, the lower Saraswathi continued to flowfed by the water from the Sutlej and other rivers. Later, theSutlej also changed its course and joined the Indus. Further,there was a world-wide drought during 2200 B.C. to 1900 B.C.which affected areas from Southern Europe to China and leadto the end of the empires in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Thisdrought was the main cause for the complete drying up of theriver Saraswathi around 1900 B.C. Therefore, along with theEgyptian and Sumer-Akhad empires of Mesopotamia, theHarappa Civilization in the Indus Valley also came to an endaround 1900 B.C.</p>
		<p>The archeological findings at Harappa and Mohenjo-daropushed back the known history of India by at least 2000 years.If we take into account the later excavations, the known historygets pushed back to another 6000 years. The area covered bythe Indus-Saraswathi civilization was more than 1.5 millionsquare kilometers which is larger than that of Western Europe.It naturally dwarfed the contemporary civilizations of Egypt andSumer. Its boundaries extended to Godavari in the South,Western U.P in the East, Kashmir in the North, and the Iranianborder in the West. This is clearly illustrated in the map(See Fig. 4.1), Further, it had a well organized administration,as will be seen in later paragraphs. It should have beeneconomically very strong due to its industries and tradingactivities, including maritime trade.</p>
