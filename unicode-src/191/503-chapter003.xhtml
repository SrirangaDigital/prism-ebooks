		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">THE KUMARI PEOPLE</h1>
		<p>The ancient chronicles indicate that before 10,000 years ago, theKumari population consisted of three distinct groups namely theDevas, the Asuras and the Nagas. We have already discussedeach group individually but not explained how they grew upin Kumari. Even though we have scanty evidence to attemptsuch an exercise, it has to be done assuming that it will be subjectto revision in future as and when new evidence crops upnecessitating such revisions.</p>
		<p>The only group which can be distinctly identified as aseparate group happens to be that of the Devas who could alsobe called Aryans or Suras and genetically categorized as ANI’s(Ancient North Indians). Even today, ANIs can be identifiedin India, Middle East, Central Asia, Europe etc. As discussedelsewhere, they were one of the two ancestral groups. As faras their relationship with Kumari is concerned, they probablyhad their origin in a central place near Chagos Archipelago anddrifted towards the Antarctic and lived mostly in the areadesignated as Olinadu (Fig 5.1) till about 40,000 years ago. Asthey lived in the cooler regions, they were light-coloured.Probably because of a small population living on a very largearea or because of abundant supply of food and other essentialsor due to some reason which cannot be comprehended, theyhad a very comfortable life-style. Probably, because of this, theplace where they lived was known as Swarga. Naturally, theywere easy-going and enjoyed life; their intellectual capabilitieswere better than their physical capabilities. Due to theirprosperity, they believed that they were a superior lot very similarto the way in which Europeans were behaving till recently.</p>

		<p>The other ancestral group out of the remaining two happensto be the ASI (Ancient South Indians). Even though there isa large ASI related population in India, there are no pure ASIsexcept for a very small number in the Andamans. What wesee today are the people who are mixture of the two ancestralgroups. This mixing up has been going on for a long timebefore 60,000 years ago because we have evidence that the initialhybrid group of Mongol Nagas migrated around 60,000 yearsago from Kumari and populated Eastern Asia and S.E. Asia.</p>
		<p>After the Mongolian group left Kumari, the Dravidian groupconsisted of black, brown and fair coloured people. As interbreeding has been a continuous process during the last 60,000years, we do not find any more pure ASIs. Therefore, thepopulation other than the Devas became a hybrid group whichdid not remain as a single group. The fairer section of thehybrid group isolated themselves from the main group andevolved on different lines. These were the later Nagas who werebeautiful and artistically oriented. Now we can visualize theKumari continent (10,000 years ago to 20,000 years ago) asconsisting of these three distinct groups, namely the Devas, theDravidians and the later Nagas.</p>
		<p>I have already mentioned that around 14,000 B.C. theKumari people were not living in Peruvalanadu and Olinadu.I have also postulated that, between 40,000 years ago and 20,000years ago, people in very cold areas moved to warmer placesnear the Equator and also beyond. This was probably due tothe harshness of the last Ice age when the world experiencedthe lowest temperature ever, around 20,000 years ago. Thismeant that the Devas, the Dravidians and the later Nagas becameclose neighbours. This probably caused friction amongst themleading to frequent quarrels. This is the reason why I havesuggested that many of the Deva-Asura conflicts described inthe Puranas must have occurred during this period. Also dueto the effects of extreme cold, as well as the restricted huntingareas, the hunter - gatherer society experienced paucity ofessentials which caused the warring groups to come together tousher in the Neolithic Revolution (Samudra Mathana).</p>
		<p>Having suggested a time period for the Deva-Asuara warsand the Neolithic Revolution, we are now in a better positionto understand more about them. When the Devas moved awayfrom Olinadu towards the Equatorial region where the Dravidianslived, they had to squeeze into a much smaller area than thevast area they had enjoyed earlier. For a hunter -gatherer society,control over land area is of prime importance and naturally thismust have been one of the causes for the animosity between thetwo groups to begin with, which manifested later as the Deva- Asura wars.</p>
		<p>From Tamil literature, we find that activities other than foodgathering such as the formation of the Sangams, rule by thePandian Kings etc. started around 14,000 years ago. The sceneof such activities has been shifting from Pehuruli river banksto Kumari river banks. From the same Tamil literature we alsolearn that the Nagas were living mostly in areas surrounded bywater and probably in the islands in the Bay area. We alsolearn that the later Nagas, apart from being handsome, exhibitedhybrid vigour as brave warriors with a vengeful nature.</p>
		<p>The word ‘Apsara’ means moving in water and that isprobably the reason why the group of people who were livingon islands in the Bay of Bengal were probably called Apsaras.Probably their movements were mostly over water as seen byothers. According to tradition, they were supposed to have beenborn out of the Milky Ocean during Samudra Mathana. Eventhough there were many of them, the most prominent amongstthem were Urvasi, Rambha, Menaka and Thilothama. We havementioned (in the 2nd Chapter) that the Celestial nymphs wereone of the products to come out of the churning. All this leadsme to interpret that as the Nagas were also associated with thechurning, the Devas and the Nagas became close to each other.Seeing their artistic talent, many Apsararas were requested toserve in Indra’s court. Their main work was dancing andsinging in the court. They were also used by Indra to preventsages engaged in severe austerities from achieving their objective.A well known story is that of Menaka who successfully seducedSage Viswamitra and their child was Sakuntala. It is interestingto note that Apsaras find a place in modern Buddhist mythicallore, reinforcing our suggestion of the close connection of theNagas with Buddhism. Further, as the Apsaras were closelyconnected with Gandharvas, we can connect the two and suggestthat both of them were the beautiful Nagas who lived in theBay Islands.</p>
		<p>In a later section of this chapter, we have given the storyof Parasurama, the son of Sage Jamadagni, whose wife wasRenuka Devi. Renuka Devi happened to see a very handsomeGandharva and admired the man for a second. This wasconsidered a sin and under Jamadagni’s instruction, Parasuramafirst beheads his mother and then requests his father to restoreher to life. The sage gave back life to his wife. What this meansis that the Gandharvas were also handsome and therefore, theApsara connection to Gandharva gets revealed as both of thembelonged to the later Naga clans. We can easily understandwhy they were stunningly beautiful. In conclusion, we can saythat even though the brown and black people of that time werealso a hybrid population, the beautiful and fair-coloured Nagaswere living separately on the islands in the Bay of Bengal, closeto the Indian Coast. Probably they were able to maintain theirdistinct identity till the end of the last Ice age when they hadto migrate to India and other places.</p>
		<p>Having established that the Kumari continent was populatedby three distinct groups of people, let us now look at theirreligious practices. We have already discussed how the religiousideas evolved during the very early days resulted in Ammanworship which is widespread in South India even today. Apartfrom Amman worship there were also many other beliefs andpractices which I have seen and experienced in my village duringthe early half of the twentieth century. Apart from their beliefin many Gods and Goddesses, the villagers believed that spiritsand demon were influencing their life. For instance, they usedto say that some spirit lived in a particular tamarind tree outsidethe village and therefore, we youngsters never used to go nearthat tree after sunset. Humans possessed by spirits, for briefperiods, used to predict things to come and the list is endless.It is exactly this type of religion known as Shamanism whichwas prevalent in many parts of the world, including Europeand North America. This type of Shamanism must have evolvedin Kumari over a very long time period, up to about 8,000 B.C.Therefore, people who migrated from Kumari before 8,000 B.C.would have continued the Shaminic practices in the new placesto where they had migrated.</p>
		<p>Subsequent to 14,000 B.C. there came the greatest pioneerof all times known as Lord Siva. He seems to be the firstperson to have started what we know as family life and alsoset up an organized government. Some Tamil writers claim thathe was the first Pandian King known as Somasundara Pandian.He was also the originator of the Sangams and he was amember of the early Sangam. He was involved in multifariousactivities of development and he is considered the originator ofmany streams of knowledge such as mysticism, medicine, dancingetc. Naturally, people of his time and later revered him as theSupreme god and afterwards, his followers belonged to areligion different to the earlier Shamanism. The idea of a newreligion, which was Lord Siva Centric, would have evolved fromthen on. Even though Shamanic ideas have been developingover many tens of thousands of years, this was the first organizedreligion. In the present day context, there are many Veera Saivagroups in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka who are pure Saivitesnot affected by the Vedic ideas. The new religion based on theworship of Lord Siva seems to have been confined mainly tothe Dravidian group. We must remember that this was the timewhen Samudra Manthana was in full swing and new ideas weregetting generated. At the time when the Dravidians wereevolving their religion, the Devas were not keeping quiet andhad their own religious practices. Initially their Gods were Indra,Varuna, Agni, Vayu - Gods who represented natures forces.Many of their religious activities centred around a fire altarprobably because they lived in colder climates. Initially, the twogroups took different directions - one relying on abhishekam andpujas with flowers for their icons and the other chanting in frontof a fire altar and pouring in ghee periodically and alsosacrificing valuable objects into the fire altar.</p>
		<p>Now, it is worth investigating as to how the Nagas wouldhave reacted to the ideas about religion getting generated amongthe Dravidians and the Devas. Even though outwardly theyseem to have aligned with both the groups for the purpose ofSamudra Mathana, they seem to have been bearing a grudgeagainst both groups because they were not able to achieve theiraspiration of being considered as equal by them. Therefore, theywere waiting for their chance to establish themselves differently.While discussing about the Persians, David Frawley in his book“The Rig Veda and the History of India” gives very usefulinformation relating to the Nagas. According to Persianliterature, people across the Tigris were considered as serpentpeople the followers of AZI DAHAKA. He identifies suchpeople as Assyrains or Phoenicians who lived across the Tigrisand Euphrates. The Persians identified these Semitic people,including the Arabs, as the off-shoots of Azi Dahaka, theserpent. The Semitic people are members of many of the racessupposed to be descendents from Shem, viz. the Jews, Arabs,Phoenicians and other people of South West Asia. Semitic isa family of languages now spoken chiefly in North Africa andSouth West Asia and consists of Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic,ancient Assyrian and Ethiopic languages.</p>
		<p>Now a clearer picture of the migration around 10,000 yearsago emerges. We know that people with Neolithic knowledgefanned out from Kumari and reached many places in the world,particularly Mehrgarh in Baluchistan and the Fertile Crescent.From these secondary centres, they must have migrated to a largearea. We also know that the Neolithic migrants consisted ofthe Dravidians and the Nagas of the time. It seems quiteprobable that they settled as independent groups in Arabia andthe Southern side of the Mediterranean on the one hand, andElam and the Northern side of the Mediterranean on the otherhand.</p>
		<p>From what the Persians had said, we can speculate thatthe Nagas seemed to have occupied Arabia and the region upto Egypt while the Dravidian group seems to have occupied theNorthern areas. We know that the linguistic and social practicesin Sumeria and Elam were Dravidian related. As stated earlier,the Nagas felt that they were a neglected group and hence theywanted to adopt a different religion. Therefore, they movedaway from the established practice which involved image worhipof many deities. They began veering towards aniconic (no idols)and monotheistic religious ideas. Thus, we find four differentapproaches to religion viz. Shaminism, Saivism, Vedic religionand Semetic religion.</p>
		<p>We are convinced that the modern humans had their originat a single place and then migrated all over the world.Similarly, the religious ideas evolved over a very long periodof time in Kumari starting from the most rudimentary ideas anddeveloping into different branches to satisfy the aspirations ofthe three district groups - the Dravidians, the Devas and theNagas.</p>
		<p>In a very broad sense we can say that Shaminism andSaivism are closer to Dravidian ideas. The Devas, after reachingthe Saraswathi heartland, befriended the willing Dravidians andevolved a religion which was a synthesis of their philosophicalideas and the down-to-earth approach of the Dravidians. Whatwe see as Hinduism today is the result of the fusion of twodifferent approaches to religion. The third one was entirelydifferent to these two as it was monotheistic and aniconic.</p>
		<p>We have explained that the Nagas of the Puranic days feltan urge to establish themselves independently in all matters andhence, the origin of one more type of religion. This urgecontinued till the beginning of the Christian era and we see thatLord Buddha, a Naga, was the originator of a new religionwhich as different to the established ones. We see from ‘livinghistory’ that Buddhism survives mostly among the populationthat could be called Naga (Mongoloid).</p>
		<p>Just like the way in which human traits such as tolerance,creative ability etc. get passed on from generation to generation,animosities also continue to survive for very long periods oftime. Thus, we see that the humiliation of the Devas by theAsuras was always remembered and when the opportunity arose,the Devas struck. Similary, the Nagas were also waiting forsuch opportunities and probably those who migrated to theMiddle East were responsible for evolving religions different towhat the Devas and the Dravidian followed. Finally LordBuddha chose to follow a path different to the Vedic one andhis religion is now universally practiced amongst the Mongoliantype of population.</p>
