		<p>While discussing the science of genetics, we saw that instructionsto produce and maintain proteins are contained in isolated partsof the genome, and these instructions are passed on form onegeneration to the next. We also saw that errors known asmutations get introduced in those instructions. It is the mutationthat helps us to infer many details about migrations of modernhumans. As explained earlier, to understand the sequence inthe genome and the mutations, the world community has spentbillions of dollars along with associated mammoth efforts ofUniversities and brilliant Noble class scientists. Further, weshould also realize that useful information contained in thegenome is very little as compared with the huge chunk of junkit contains. In contrast, let us see how we have treated thePuranas when compared with the treatment meted out to thegenome. Puranas are also like what we see in the genome inthe sense that they are also ancient, passed on from generationto generation and prone to mutations which are much morethan those in the case of genetics. Therefore, I do notunderstand why Puranas got a bad treatment.</p>
<p>The dictionary meaning of mutation is the “process of aninstance of change or alteration”. In the case of genetics,mutation means a change in the DNA sequence which whentransmitted to off-springs gives rise to heritable variations. Inthe case of cultural mutations, social practices that werefollowed by generation prior to the occurrence of the mutationsget altered, at times drastically. When we identify such amutation, it is possible to infer the reason why such a mutationoccurred which may help us to understand the history of theperiod when the mutation occurred. Cultural mutations couldbe of two types, one slow and evolutionary in nature, andanother of a sudden nature. It is the latter with which we areconcerned because they can be identified more easily and theyinvariably tell a story of importance as far as history isconcerned. In the succeeding paragraphs, we shall introducethe readers to some of the cultural mutations and what theyimply.</p>
<p>Now let me take up for discussion three such mutationswhich are very important from the point of view ofunderstanding ancient history. The group of people who wereenemies of the Devas were called the Asuras. Even though inthe early-Vedic period the word ‘Asura’ did not refer to peoplewith any bad attributes, the connotation changed radically inthe late Vedic period. According to the Hindu Encyclopedia“The metamorphosis of the meaning of the word ‘asura’ from‘beneficent god’ to ‘malevolent spirit or being’ in the Vedic andpost Vedic literature is rather baffling. In early Vedic literaturethe term ‘Asura’ denotes the supreme spirit, derived probably,from the root as (to exist) or asu (life force). It must haveoriginally meant a ‘self existing being’ or the ‘being of life forceand power’. However, the Nirukta, the standard dictionary ofVedic terms, defines ‘Asuras as those who are not satisfied intheir positions, the ever fickle and those who are deprived oftheir positions by the Suras or Devas”. They are also definedas ‘those addicted to selfish bodily pleasures’. This is one ofthe major cultural mutations that could be identified easily.</p>
<p>There is a well known story of a fish that got caught inthe hands of Manu and grew big and bigger day-by-day. Itbegs Manu to release it with a promise to help him in returnduring the flood. When the flood came, the fish asks Manuto tie a rope from his boat to its fin. Then the fish takes Manu’sboat to the Himalayas for safety. When the flood subsides,Manu led his people to the banks of the Saraswathi andestablished a great dynasty consisting of sages and Kings. Manuis supposed to have lived in Malaya Mountains in Kerala whichshows his Southern Origin. The story of Manu and the fishis contained in Shatapath Brahmana. Manu’s travel from SouthIndia to Saraswathi heartland due to the flood re-inforces myconclusion that the Devas from Kumari area reached theSaraswathi heartland through the sea-route. David Fraweley andRajaram have explained the story of Manu in their book“Hidden Horizons”. The important point that I have pickedup from their narration is that Manu had a daughter, Ela, fromwhom the Lunar dynasty (Chandra Vamsa) arose. Ela also hada masculine form from whom arose the Solar dynasty (SuryaVamsa). According to Fraweley and Rajaram, the story ofManu’s daughter, Ela, turning into a man may be read aschange from matrilineal to patrilineal practice. Traditions placesManu in what is now known as Kerala where royal successionhas always been through the female line. What is importantto note is that a conscious effort was made to make the societymove from the matrilineal to patrilineal practice after Kumaripeople settled in the Saraswathi area. This was another culturalmutation introduced by the elite who had an upper hand.</p>
<p>With respect to language also there have been importantdevelopments which is the third mutation that I want tomention. We know that Tamil, Telugu, Kannada andMalayalam are all Dravidian languages. Even though their basicorigin is Dravidian barring Tamil all of them accepted manyfeatures of Sanskrit. Telugu ‘was the first’ to break away fromthe Dravidian fold followed by Kannada and Malayalam.Sanskrit tried to make inroads into Tamil also but it was notan easy task. The fact of the matter is that after migrating tothe Saraswathi area, the Devas probably imposed their languageon Dravidians similar to the way adopted by the British toimpose English in India.</p>
<p>The three mutations discussed above seem to tell us thechanges that occurred after the Devas settled down in theSaraswathi area. During the Puranic days in Kumari, therewere two major groups known as the Suras and the Asuras.In Kumari, the Asuras had an upper hand most of the timeand therefore the Suras must have been itching to take revengeagainst them. The Suras shifted to the Saraswathi area a fewthousand years later than the Asuras who had migrated around10,000 years ago. After their arrival in the Saraswathi region,the Aryans who were the Suras realized that their erstwhileenemies, namely the Asuras, had spread themselves too thin andhence, were not an effective opposition to contend with in thenew environment. Naturally this emboldened the Aryans whoconsolidated themselves and planned a strategy to humiliate theirerstwhile tormentors. Thus, we see that in the late Vedic period,the Asuras were not only deprived of their positions but alsolost the importance of their language and social practices suchas the matrilineal practice. The Puranas also reflect the sameattitude picturing Asuras as ‘bad’ people.</p>
<p>Before striking back, the Suras planned things meticulouslyand introduced the new Chatur Varna system based on theprofessions followed by its members. They absorbed the brilliantparppanars among the Asuras like Agastya, Vasishta etc. andgave them exalted positions in the new order. Similarly, theymust have absorbed the military intelligentia of the Asuras inthe Kshtriya fold and re-shaped the social structure completelyso that the Asuras left outside this group became quite weak.Also, they saw to it that Sanskrit became a dominant languagerelegating a second place to Dravidian languages. In religionalso, the Vedic religion became supreme even though theyabsorbed some of the practices of the Asuras which suited theirneeds. What ever they did may have been right or wrong, butthey laid a strong foundation for developing various knowledgestreams which culminated in the greatest knowledge bank of theancient world.</p>
<p>Our conclusion based on Cultural mutations gets fully reinforced if we look at what Nirukta says. To make this readingeasy, we repeat below what Nirukta says. Nirukta defines“Asuras as those who are not satisfied in their position, the everfickle and those who are deprived of their positions by Surasor Devas”. This is a clear cut statement which conveys thatthe Suras relegated the Asuras to lower positions with whichthey were not satisfied. According to A.I.T nomads from theSteppe descended on the Indus valley and drove away theDravidians. However, the real fact seems to be that the Surasfrom Kumari, who landed in the Saraswathi area, cleverlymanipulated things to gain superiority in the Indus-Saraswathiregion.</p>
<p>The three mutations mentioned above are direct ones forwhich we have evidence. For instance the change in theconnotation of the meaning of the Asuras is seen in Vedicliterature and the Nirukta. There may be cultural mutationsfor which no direct evidence is available but which is inferredfrom its effects on society. Let us now discuss the details ofone such inferred mutation.</p>
<p>People all over the world talk of Heaven and Hell, andmany of us are sure that Heaven is above our heads and Hellis down below the ground. This belief may be alright for asociety of primitive people. People exposed to modern scienceknow very clearly that there is no real Heaven but only animaginary one. In order to search for a clue, to unravel themystery of Heaven and Hell, I looked at the ‘living history’aspect of South India. I have been born and brought up inTamil Nadu and have lived in Karnataka for more than 50 years.I was struck by the ideas about the direction that a house shouldface being diametrically opposite between the two neighboringStates. In the village in Tamil Nadu where I lived for morethan 20 years, I have seen a clear preference for a South facinghouse. The street where I lived was in a East-West directionand there was only one row of houses that was South facingwhich clearly indicated preference for South facing houses. Ihave also heard that South facing houses commanded apremium. Further, there was a belief that the wind from theSouth is quite a beneficial one. Therefore, when I had to buya plot in Bangalore, I chose a South facing one and built ahouse. Sometime later I faced difficulty when I wanted to sellthe house because the prospective buyers in Karnataka hated aSouth facing house. When I pursued my investigation, therewere clear signs to indicate that there has been a deliberateattempt in the past to decry the South in favour of the North.According to Tamil literature, Lord Siva’s abode was in Kumaribut the Saraswathi society shifted the same to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>As my discussion on other mutations confirm that the elitepopulation of Saraswathi heartland had changed many things,I thought that they might have also meddled with the directionsto give an inferior status to the Southern direction. Therefore,I reversed the North-South directions in the world map (SeeFig 5.3) and tried to explain certain unbelievable Puranic stories.To my surprise, the trick did work and I was able to give anew meaning to certain Puranic beliefs and stories as describedin the succeeding paragarphs.</p>
<p>We shall now be using the inferred mutation to justify thefact that some of the Puranic stories contain true facts, as opposedto the popular belief that all Puranic stories are a pack of lies.If the ‘UP’ and ‘DOWN’ directions were as per Fig 5.2, manyof the Puranic stories and even modern beliefs of Heaven andHell become quite clear. According to the Puranas, the Devaslived up above and the Nagas lived down below. If people wholived in Olinadu could be called the Devas, this perfectly fitsinto Puranic descriptions and mythical stories.</p>
<p>Firstly, let us discuss the three worlds and the famous Rishi,Narada, who was known as Deva Rishi. Naturally, Deva Rishiwould have lived in Devaloka. As a child I had seen a numberof movies with Puranic themes. Whenever Saga Naradaappeared, he would be floating above the clouds indicating hewas up above. It was presumed that Heaven was above theclouds and Narada could easily reach the abode of LordNarayan or Lord Shiva in Heaven.</p>
<p>Similarly, a prince who was madly in love with a Nagabeauty would enter a snake pit and burrow through the earthto reach the most beautiful Naga palace down below in NagaLoka. Alternatively, there have been portrayals when a personwho wanted to reach the Naga land jumped into the water andthen went down, down and down till he reached his destination.Such pictures have been etched in my memory and I imaginedthat Devas lived on a flat pieces of land very much above ourheads and that the Nagas lived in a floor deep below the Earthwhich I imagined was flat. Thus, the picture I had was of threelokas, one above the other like a basement ground floor andfirst floor in a modern building except that the distance betweeneach floor was quite large. This picture is not peculiar to mealone. Even today, this distorted idea about Heaven and Hellhas not vanished and people do think that God lives in Heavenwhich is way above our heads. Even followers of otherreligions have such beliefs. Now that modern science hasexplored many parts of the Universe, we are sure that there existno such distinct flat areas, one above the other. Air travel acrossthe Continents, space travels and the landings on the Moon andphotographs of the Earth from far-off distances have educatedthe common man about the nature of planets and satellites.Therefore, no more proof is needed to state that the idea ofa flat Earth, Heaven above and Hell below is not correct.</p>
<p>Here I remember some funny opinions of some peopleabout the space probes. Particularly, one gentleman from theU.K, who called himself the President of the Flat Earth Society,used to issue press statements ridiculing the news about spaceprobes and associated photographs. He believed in a flat Earthand only recently he seems to have retired from his exalted statusas the President of the society.</p>
<p>Now-a-days we are used to seeing the Earth in the mapsin a particular way, that is with the Arctic region on top andthe Antarctic down below. In the olden days, before the endof the last Ice age, people probably looked at the worlddifferently [see Fig. 5.3] where the Antarctic was on the topand Europe down-under. Our ancients, ten thousand years ago,were not aware of maps. However, I am using it as an analogywhich the readers can easily understand. The sum andsubstance is that the three lokas were on a single level, namelyjust above the sea level. The ‘UP’ and ‘DOWN’ were attributedbecause one loka was on the top of the map and the other wasbelow the Bhooloka in the map. As this was an old conceptmore than 10,000 years old, slowly ‘up’ and ‘down’ got differentmeanings and this came to be pictured as three flat surfaces, oneabove the other, giving rise to the idea of Heaven up above andHell down below.</p><figure>	<img src="images/0016.jpg" alt="image" />			<figcaption>Fig. 5.2 How Kumari people saw the world - 14000 B.C. with devaloka on top and nagaloka down under</figcaption></figure><p>The most popular Puranic figure happens to be SageNarada who was also known as Deva Rishi. Even though hewas well-meaning, his methods were peculiar in that he usuallyinstigated people to start fights which invariably ended on adesirable manner. If we imagine that the three lokas were oneabove the other, the sort of vehicle he would have used to goup and down becomes a serious question. Now if we picturehim in the context of the Kumari Model, he had to move onlylaterally and not vertically. The three lokas being independententities, they probably had entry problem for citizens of the otherlokas. Here we can assume that Narada, being a very importantcitizen of Devaloka, probably had visas to travel through theother two lokas and that was probably the reason why he wascalled Triloka Sanchari (one who moves through the threelokas’.</p>
<p>Next let me briefly, explain the story of Trisanku<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-504-01">*</a></sup> whichI have known from early childhood. Satyavratha was a goodking. As his subjects liked him very much, they wanted himto go to Heaven. As the King heard this many times, he becamevery obsessed with the idea. The idea went into his head tosuch an extent and he wanted to go to Deva Loka immediatelywith his existing body. Therefore, he approached his head priest,Sage Vasishta, and put forward his peculiar proposal. The Sageridiculed him for his stupid desire and sent him away. Thenthe King approached Sage Vasishta’s sons to help him. Theynot only ridiculed him but also cursed him to become aChandala. Despite the humiliations and the curse, he refusedto give up him dream.</p>
<p>When Satyavratha was returning to his palace, he met SageVishwamitra who was the arch enemy of Sage Vasishta. SageVishwamitra heard about the King’s fervent desire and thehumiliations the King had suffered from the hands of his enemy,Sage Vasishta, and his sons. He saw this as a great opportunityto show his superiority over his enemy and promised the Kingthat he would fulfil his desire. He arranged a great sacrificeand was able to send the King to Devaloka. However, the Devasthrew the king out. Sage Vishwamitra wanted to help the fallingKing. According to story, he created a new Heaven in-betweenDevaloka and Bhooloka where the King landed and continuedto live ever after. This intermediate Heaven is known as TrisankuSwarga in Puranic stories.</p>
<p>As a child I understood the story just as the other peopleunderstood it. Bhooloka is Earth where we all live. Devalokais above our heads quite a distance from us. This is the placewhere the Devas lived. Therefore, when Sage Vishwamitrasucceeded in his efforts, through the sacrifice he performed, theKing ascended to Heaven like the rockets lifting off. When hereached Heaven, the King was kicked out and he tumbled downon to the ground. The Sage, with his powers creates a worldin-between Heaven and Earth known as Trisanku Swarga wherethe King lands safely. As a child I imagined it was a floorbetween the first floor and the ground floor like the mezzaninefloor we see today.</p>
<p>Fantasy apart, if we try to understand the same myth withthe backdrop of the Kumari Model, a different satisfactorypicture emerges. According to the Kumari Model, the Devalokaand Bhooloka were side by side with well protected borders.When Trisanku enters Deva loka without permission, the Devasextradite him just as illegal immigrants are thrown out today.Fortunately, Sage Vishwamitra found a good solution and createda new country for Trisanku in between the countries of theDevas and the non-Devas. Many such examples could be givenbut I am restricting myself to the above story about which Ihave been thinking for more than 70 years and now feel gladthat I have found a possible answer.</p>
<p>After describing the three direct mutations, we discussed thereason for them and concluded that the Devas found themselvesto be much stronger than the Asuras. Naturally this gave thema wonderful opportunity to humiliate their erstwhile tormentorsby causing such mutations. Deva - Asura Division and theiranimosities are Puranic and therefore, in order to establish theirveracity, we have to search for other supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Based on the most recent genetic studies, scientists haveconcluded that the founder groups for the present day diversepopulation of India are two in number which could be calledas the Ancient South Indians (ASI) and the Ancient North India(ANI). Today, ASI have no relationship outside India, whereasANIs are genetically close to middle Easterners, Central Asiansand the Europeans. This is a very important conclusion forunderstanding the deep past of the India population. A similarpicture of two founder groups was evident earlier also asexplained below:</p>
<p>It was Kar Land Steiner who saw the biochemical diversityamong living humans which led to identification of blood groupsas A and B. Later, a Swiss couple (Hirszfields), who did furtherwork on blood groups, suggested that A and B groups containtraces of the ‘pure’ population of aboriginal humans. Theirsuggestion was not pursued successfully even though it was afact that the A group is predominant in Northern Europe andthe B group is found in high frequency in India. Regardingthe existence of two independent groups of people in thebeginning, there is total agreement among Puranic narrations,presence of blood groups A and B in Europe and India, andthe most recent genetic studies leading to the conclusion thatthe founder groups were two in number.</p>
<p>They lived in their respective territories and had their socialstructure which would have consisted of a class controlling civiland military affairs. Similarly, there must have been a priestlyclass also. The Tamil’s called their priestly class Parppanars (orseers) and they were not the so called Aryans. For instance,before the migration to the Saraswathi heartland, Agasthya andVasishta were Dravidian seers. When the migration toSaraswathi took place, Devas identified this opportunity andaligned with the Kshatriyas and the Brahmins amongst theAsuras and the Nagas. Whereas the division in Kumari wasbased on colour only they used the same name Chatur Varnaand created a new social system consisting of Brahmins,Kshatriyas, Vysyas, and Shudras. The trick used was similarto what the British did by having brilliant Indians in the civiland military services. Through this clever trick, the Aryans wereable get the full support of all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vysyasamongst the Dravidians and the Nagas and thus, practicallydecimated the opposing Asuras. Afterwards, they had their ownway and changed many old concepts of the other two groupsto suit their newly acquired status of being the elite group amongthe migrants to the Saraswathi area. The above picture emergesbased on the interpretation of the cultural mutations discussedearlier.</p>
