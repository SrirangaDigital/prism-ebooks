		<p>Modern humans are found all over the world. If they had theirorigin in a single place, they would have migrated to variousparts of the world during the last 100,000 years or so. Themigrations would have occurred at different times and throughmany different routes. In order to establish a reasonable pictureof ancient migrations, we have to extract whatever informationwe can from ancient chronicles and use the tools offered bymany other branches of knowledge to obtain a reasonable picture.Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach is indispensable to geta correct picture of ancient migrations. It is this approach wehave followed in our efforts to understand the location wheremodern humans evolved and what migration routes they took.</p>
		<p>The efforts put in to understand the subject of genetics ismind boggling and in a very short period of about four decades,the scientists have understood the book of life even though duringthe earlier part of the last century many senior scientists thoughtit was an impossible task. Therefore, let us take a look at thehistory of genetics during the recent decades by highlightingsome of the important projects which resulted in our presentunderstanding of the subject A big push for the developmentof Genetics came from a major project known as “TheInternational Human Genome Project” (HGP). It is consideredas the most spectacular scientific project since man walked onthe moon. The outcome from the project was the rawtranslation of three billion building blocks of all life. Thus,the complexity of the genome sequence for a single human beingwas obtained in 2001, fifteen years after the commencement ofthe project and 50 years after the discovery of the double helix.The astonishing result of the project was that the human geneticcode (genome) is practically identical for all people expect fora very small percentage of differences which causes thebewildering array of diversity among humans. HGP triggereda lot of activity in India and the Council of Scientific Researchlaunched the Indian Genome Variation (IGV) consortium, avery valuable step to understand the genetic diversity in India.Indian Scientists have understood the high level of diversity inIndia consisting of every possible known genotype. Anothermajor international project on the subject is the “Genographicproject” launched by IBM and the National Geographic Society.The project is in its final stages and the five year project willcreate and use one of the largest databases of DNA samplesever assembled to show how the earth was populated bymapping the geographical distribution of various genotypes.</p>
		<p>It was explained earlier that it is the markers in the DNAwhich indicate evolution and migration. There are two typesof markers - the X-chromosome marker and the Y-chromosomemarker - derived from the female line and the male linerespectively. To enable easy understanding, we shall be discussingmigrations based on the geographical frequency distribution ofthe Y-marker only unless specifically mentioned otherwise.Reasonable amount of work has been done to understand thevarious markers found amongst the humans. Firstly, there doesnot seem to be any doubt about the chronological order of thesemarkers and we can easily understand which marker gave riseto which other marker. Secondly, the approximate time whena new marker arose can also be estimated. With these twopieces of information we can construct a genealogical tree ofthe markers as given in Fig 6.1. Unfortunately, this tree alonecannot give the migration pattern. For that, we will have toget more information, namely the geographical distribution ofthe markers concerned as indicated in Fig 6.1 itself.</p>
		<p>Apart from the genealogical tree and the geographicalfrequency distribution, a third factor comes into play. The thirdfactor is the interpretation of the data obtained. Many a time,the interpretation becomes subjective resulting in very wrongconclusions. Let us say that a particular marker is seen in twoareas A and B. Here Genetics alone cannot tell us whethermigration was from A to B or B to A. In many cases thescientists have their pet theories and start tailoring the dataobtained to advance their line of argument as has been the casewith the A.I.T. To give another example of distortedinterpretation of scientific data, I would like to cite the case ofthe distribution of the Y - marker, M20. This marker is foundonly in South India and people with it can be called the SouthIndian clan. For traditional scientists, Central Asia was the placefrom where migrations took place. Therefore, these scientistsare happy to say, without batting an eyelid, that people withmarker M20 arose in Central Asia and were transported toSouth India - lock, stock and barrel. Such distortions occurbecause of the subjective interpretation of the scientist involvedand by ignoring all other evidence such as ‘living history’.Therefore, it is quite essential that ‘living history’ should becomean important pillar of interpretation, probably it should be givenas much weightage as Genetics.</p>
