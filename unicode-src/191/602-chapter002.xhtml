		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">Early Wave of Migration</h1>
		<p>Our quest to establish the identity of Aryans has led us to thelarger problem of locating the original home and also themigrations paths of the ‘modern humans.’ Research in thisexciting field has been going on for centuries but the real pictureseems to be eluding us still. As an Air Force officer and asa design engineer in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, I used tobe part of teams investigating aircraft accidents. In the beginningof any investigation, a pet theory will emerge which would failcertain acid tests to establish its veracity. However, the originalpet theory will go on circulating like a scratched gramophonerecord playing the same thing repeatedly till a reasonablealternative emerges. In such cases, the best answer used to beto think differently, away from the beaten track, which mayeventually lead us to the right path. By thinking differentlyabout the Aryan problem, I have been fairly successful in myefforts and I have been able to get a coherent picture aboutKumari Kandam - how it was the place of origin of all livinganimals including ‘modern humans’, how the different sectionsof the population were distributed and how the continentvanished in stages necessitating the migration of its populationthrough the super high way provided by the Indian subcontinent.</p>
		<p>The suggestion of eminent scientists to have a number ofpillars of interpretation is a very wise one and we must followthat approach. For instance, the frequency distribution ofM-17 gives support to both the contending parties of the AryanInvasion Theory. Therefore, in such cases, we have to use thetools offered by branches of knowledge other than Genetics tounravel the mystery. That is the approach we are followingestablishing a picture of Kumari Kandam without much helpfrom Genetic science and using genetics to validate the picturearrived at.</p>
		<p>In the earlier chapters, we have pointed out the anomaliesin the Africa model and especially its Coastal Migration Theory,and proposed an alternative model known as the KumariModel. Arguments in favour of Kumari Model have been givenand now in this chapter, we want to see whether the modelcould be justified on the basis of the genetic data available.Even though there are many scientific papers on the subject, wepropose to derive support for the Kumari Model through thefollowing two scientific papers:</p>
		<p>(1) A prehistory of Indian Y chromosomes: Evaluating demicdiffusion scenarios by Sangamitra Sahoo et al edited byColin Renfew, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UnitedKingdom, and approved November 23, 2005.</p>
		<p>(2) Reconstructing Indian population history by David Reich,Kumarasamy Thangaraja et al Published in the Internationalweekly journal of science ‘Nature’ dated 24th September2009.</p>
		<p>The paper was given adequate media coverage in ‘TheHindu’ and the ‘Times of India’.</p>
		<p>From the first paper we understand that</p>
		<p>(a) The sharing of some Y-chromosomal haplogroups betweenIndia and central Asian population is most parsimoniouslyexplained by a deep, common ancestry between the tworegions, with diffusion of some Indian specific lineagesnorthward.</p>
		<p>(b) The Y-chromosomal data consistently suggest a largelySouth Asian origin for Indian caste communities and argueagainst any major influx from North West of India.</p>
		<p>(c) The initial settlement, between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago,was most likely over the Southern route from Africa.</p>
		<p>From the conclusions arrived at in the first paper, it clearlyemerges that the Indian population is mostly of South Asianorigin and the movement of people seems to be from South toNorth and beyond. It may be noted that the authors havesuggested migration from Africa to South India through asouthern route probably because of the well entrenched Africanorigin. Our argument is to look at Kumari Kandam whichsuggests a path from Africa to South India. The migrationdirection in the Kumari Model is mostly from South to Northas established in the paper unlike the improbable North to Southmigration of the Africa Model.</p>
		<p>According to the second paper by David Reich and others-</p>
		<p>(a) All the diverse group seen spread out in India came fromtwo major ancestral populations that are geneticallydivergent.</p>
		<p>(b) The two ancestral populations are the Ancestral NorthIndians (ANI) and the Ancestral South Indians (ASI).</p>
		<p>(c) The indigenous population seen in Andaman have moreaffinity to ASI. Otherwise they have no relationship withother populations anywhere in the world.</p>
		<p>(e) The media, quoting scientists, reported “initial settlementtook place 65,000 years ago in the Andamans and theancient south India around the same time”.</p>
		<p>Africa, Kumari and Andamans, according to the KumariModel, had land connections before the deluge around 60,000years ago. The rise in the sea level affected the connections andthe three areas got totally isolated from each other. TheAndaman population got cut-off from Kumari and the islandpopulation remained in the same primitive state as they werewhen they got isolated. That is why scientists call them ‘livingfossils’ and we can learn a lot by studying them. Further geneticscreening has clearly revealed that the Andaman population hasmore affinity to ASI and they have no relationship with anyother population anywhere in the world. ASI are found inSouth India but mixed quite a bit with others. As ASI hasno relationship to Africa, the settlements that took place in theAndamans and ancient South India around 65,000 years agowere not from Africa. This naturally raises serious doubts aboutthe Coastal Migration Theory and suggests that the ASI werepart of the Kumari population. Therefore, we can postulate thatthe two ancestral Population (ASI and ANI) evolved in theKumari continent and migrated to India and Andamans whenthe sea engulfed parts of Kumari.</p>
		<p>In the absence of any contrary information, we can assumethat the Shompen tribe of Nicobar got isolated around 60,000years ago. As Shompens are Mongoloid, they must haveexisted before 60,000 years. In the Kumari Model, I haveproposed that the Mongoloid population was due to interbreeding between ANI and ASI. We also know from Tamilliterature that the Nagas were a sea people and lived mostly Eastof India. Therefore, in the Kumari Model, the Nagas livedmostly in the coastal areas around the Bay of Bengal up toIndonesia.</p>
		<p>Now let us discuss the deluge that occurred around 60,000years ago and the consequent migrations. When the sea levelrose, the coastline would have receded considerably submerginglarge areas and the people who had Y marker M-130 wouldhave shifted to nearby inland areas such as India, Burma, Siam,Malaysia, Indonesia etc. This is why we see M-130 in India,Malaysia, New Guinea and also in Australia. Elsewhere, wehave mentioned about the high concentration of M-130 inSiberia, Mongolia etc. What must have happened is that a fairlylarge population would have not only moved inland but a goodnumber of them should have trekked long distances to reachChina Mongolia etc. Fig 6.2 and Fig 6.3 show the migrationpaths of M130 people as per the Kumari Model and the AfricaModel respectively.</p>
		<p>From the ancestral Y-chromosome marker M168, aroseY-markers M130 and M89 [Fig. 6.1] From the availableevidence, Y-marker M130 seems to be the older one andtherefore, we can say that M-89 is less than 50,000 years old.If we call the exodus of M-130 people as the first wave ofmigration, we can call the movement of M-89 people as thesecond wave of migration of modern humans. The frequencydistribution of M-89 tells us a story. It is present in Ethiopia,Sudan, Middle East and up to Levant. As there is no evidenceof M-89 people of Levant in Europe, it has to be presumed thatin this wave the migration stopped at Levant and did not proceedfurther. Further, the frequency of later M-89 lineage markersis very low in North East Africa when compared with Levantwhich means that after the initial migration, contact with Levantand North Eastern Africa was absent.</p>
		<p>Armed with the above genetic data, let us investigate thesecond wave of migration from Kumari. We also known thatM-130 is absent from the M-89 population. Therefore, in theKumari Models, the two populations would have lived inisolation i.e. M-130 people on the Eastern side of Kumari andM-89 people on the Western side of Kumari. In order toestablish the migration path from Kumari, let us first look atthe sea depths around Kumari 50,000 years ago. If the sealevels had been sufficiently low, there is a clear land connectionfrom Chagos to Maldives to Laccadives and the Westerncoastline of India leading to the Persian Gulf which wasprobably a fertile delta at that time. From there, they mighthave migrated in different directions, the main group reachingLevant and another group going to Sudan and Ethiopia. Fromgenetic data, one can see that these two groups lived in isolationafter the migration. There is also another possibility. One groupmight have taken the Persian Gulf route and another reachedSocotra and then proceeded to North East Africa (See Fig 6.2).</p>
		<p>My choice to follow a path different to the beaten trackseems to have paid dividends in that my ideas about themigrations become clearer and I am now in a position toexplain things which I thought was impossible. Readers mighthave noticed that I was always trying to explain the origin ofNagas without any substantial evidence. First and foremost ismy suggestion that the Nagas were a cross breed between thetwo ancestral populations, one with a fairer skin colour and theother, with a darker skin colour. In my thinking it was theseNagas who were called Mongols and who populated the Easternside of Kumari and Asia from Australia to Siberia. I feel thatmy discussion of M-130 migrations have given an answer whichis good enough proof that the Nagas were the cross breed I hadimagined. The aborigines of Australia, who have M-130, arevery dark in colour. It is the dark colour of these people inAustralia which made scientists connect them with the Africandark population and propose that the migration was from Africato Australia. We also know that the fair coloured Mongolsliving in Mongolia, Siberia etc also have the same M-130.Therefore, the dark as well as the fair population with Mongolianfeatures were born to M-130 fathers. As we believe that theoriginal ancestral populations were of two colours, the crossbredchildren could either be dark or fair. This is similar to the AngloIndians whom we have seen and even though they are generallyfair, we also see some dark persons in their group. Therefore,by discussing the M-130 migrations, we got confirmation forthe hybrid nature of the Mongolian population.</p>
		<p>Summarizing, we can say that the conclusions arrived atin the two papers do not support the Africa Model. We alsosee that they do not contradict the Kumari Model in any way.A strong message is that the migrations through India have beenfrom South to North. If this had actually happened, the originalhome of the population that passed through India could onlybe Kumari Kandam. As stated earlier, Africa had no role toplay in subsequent migrations after giving the M-168 father.Therefore, if ANI arrived in India around 40,000 years ago itwas only from Kumari Kandam. So we can conclude thatgenetic data supports the Kumari Model fully.</p>
