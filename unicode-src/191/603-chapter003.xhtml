		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">MAIN WAVE OF MIGRATION</h1>
		<p>The majority of modern humans living in the Indian subcontinent, Middle East, Central Asia, Europe, Siberia, East andSouth East Asia and also America owe their origin to theancestor who had Y-marker M-9 in him. That is the reasonwhy I have christened the migrations of M-9 lineage as the“Main Wave of Migration” M-9 arose from M-89 which wasthe marker discussed in the earlier part of this chapter inconnection with the early wave of migration (second wave).There is the well-established African Model which gives itsversion as to where M-9 arose and how it spread. As we findsome anomolies in this model, we proposed a different modelknown as the Kumari Model. First, we shall explain migrationsbased on the Africa Model (Fig 6.4), point out the anomaliesin the Model and then describe the migrations based on theKumari Model.</p>
		<p>According to the Africa Model, Y marker M-9 is supposedto have arisen in Iran or in some nearby area. As people withM-9 lineage are seen all over Europe and Asia, they areappropriately called the Eurasian Clan. In the first instance, theM-9 clan got split into two groups, one group moving Southtowards the sub-continent and the other, towards Central Asia.From M-9, three markers arose which are M-45, M-20 and M175 as shown in Fig 6.1. M-45 is seen in Central Asia andIndia, and the Africa model assumes that it arose in CentralAsia. This raises the question of how M-45 would have reachedIndia. For this, the answer in the Africa Model is that peoplewith M-45 migrated into India from Central Asia at a laterperiod.</p>
		<p>Marker M-20 also arose from M-9, and it is found mostlyin South India and rarely outside. Therefore, people with M20 could be called the South Indian clan. As M-20 aroseoutside India, as per the Africa Model, they were supposed tohave migrated into India and went all the way to the South.The third marker, M-175, which arose from M-9 is mostly foundin East Asia. They probably followed a hazardous route toreach Korea where its frequency is 30% and defines the EastAsian clan.</p>
		<p>The migration patterns of all significant markers as per the“out of Africa” model are traced in Fig 6.4. In Central Asia,M-45 becomes two branches, i.e. M-173 proceeding towardsEurope and M-242 proceeding towards Siberia. Subsequently,from M-173 arose M-17 and both these markers are dominantin Europe. M-173 could be called the West European markerand M-17, the Indo European marker. It is strange thatM-17 is found in substantial frequency amongst the I.E. speakingpopulation of North India. M-242 can be called a Siberianmarker. Another branch of M-9 happens to be M-175 fromwhich arose M-122. M-175 can be called an East Asian marker.M-122 is associated with agricultural expansion in most of EastAsia and South East Asia. Today, M-175 related lineagesaccount for 60% of Y-chromosome in East Asia. If we lookat the frequency distribution of some of the markers and theirplaces of origin, there are anomalies attributable to the AfricaModel, some of which are mentioned below:</p>
		<p>(a) The first difficulty is regarding the Y-marker M-20 whichis purely a South Indian marker as it is found in a highpercentage in South India (50%) and very rarely outside.If this fact has to fit into the African Model, the onlyexplanation could be the M-20 was shunted to South Indiafrom Iran or Central Asia. If at all M-20 people hadtraversed the path from Iran to South India around 30,000years ago, the journey would have been a slow one. Ifso, they should have left traces on the way which does notseem to be the case. Further, even if we assume that theytravelled without leaving any evidence on the way, whywould they have ignored much better river basins on theway to South India. In the absence of a reasonableexplanation for these doubts, it is very difficult to acceptthe proposition that M-20 people were shunted through thepasses in the high mountains of the North West of thesub-continent and chose to proceed towards South Indiaignoring all the habitable places on the way.</p>
		<p>(b) M-175 and M-122 are East Asian markers and M-122 isalso found in the North Eastern parts of the sub-continent.When the migrants found many fertile zones in East Asia,why would they again take the trouble of crossing theHimalayas to get into India?</p>
		<p>(c) The third one, seems to be most glaring anomaly and itpertains to marker M-242. In the Africa Model, M-242arose in Siberia and spread to East Asia. The story wouldhave been a simple one but for an analysis of M-45 lineageby Mark Seielstad and Spencer Wells. They found thatM-242, which arose from M-45, is distributed across Asiafrom Southern India to China to Siberia and throughoutthe Americas. South India is at the extreme end of Indiaand how it could reach South India is a mystery.</p>
		<p>Based on the Kumari Model, we shall now take up fordiscussion the origin and migration paths of the various Ymarkers. We shall be discussing the same markers that wediscussed in connection with the Africa Model. Theirdestinations are also identical as they are derived from thepresent day geographical distribution of the markers. Similarly,the chronological order in which the markers arose and alsothe approximate time when they arose are the same. However,the place of origin of the markers and their migration pathsare different in the two models.</p>
		<p>We know very well that all non-Africans owe their originto the M-168 father. Whereas, in the case of the Africa Model,M-168 starts from Africa, in the cause of the Kumari Modelit starts from the Kumari Continent. After the deluge, around60,000 years ago, the land connection between Africa andKumari was lost and Africa got isolated from the main bodyof modern humans. Kumari had the M-168 marker and fromit arose M-130 and M-89. We have already discussed how theyspread. Afterwards, from M-89 arose M-9 which is the mostimportant marker responsible for the main wave of migrations.</p>
		<p>In the Kumari Model, M-9 reached the shores of India andone group of M-9 people settled down happily in South Indiafrom whom marker M-20 arose and people with this markerdid not venture outside South India. Regarding the other twomarkers which arose from M-9, M-45 took the route throughthe Western coast when the Western coastline was very muchfarther into the sea. This route seems to have been the favouriteroute for many migrations when people from Kumari reachedthe Gujarat coast and then went further North to reach Iran,Central Asia, Europe etc.</p>
		<p>The age of M-9 is estimated to be about 40,000 years oldand that of M-45 about 35,000 years old. If we refer to thetwo scientific papers mentioned earlier and the views of thescientists on the subject, the ANIs (Ancient North Indians) aresupposed to have arrived in India around 40,000 years ago. Wealso see that M-45 people were most probably the ANIsmentioned in the paper. Therefore, we can tentatively suggestthat M-45 arose in India. As we have equated M-45 and ANIs,it is this group which would have spread up to Europe.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, we have some archeological evidence to connectM-45 and the first settlement in Europe. The remains of modernhumans were unearthed in 1868 at a place known as CroMagnon cave in South Eastern France. The place was occupiedaround 30,000 years ago and it has been suggested that the CroMagnons<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-603-01">*</a></sup> must have arrived from some warm place. As theage of M-45 is around 35,000 years it neatly fits in with theother details because they were from a warm place and couldhave taken around 5,000 years to reach Cro-Magnon. We alsoknow that there is an isolated population in Europe known asBasque. They live in the adjoining areas of France and Spain,and they speak a language different to other Europeans. Theyseem to have followed the Cro-Magnons. When compared withother Europeans, the frequency distribution of M-173 (whicharose from M-45) is rather high among the Basques. We can,therefore, conclude that M-45 which is present in the Northernparts of India and which is probably the ANI, migrated furthertowards Iran, Central Asia and Europe. Therefore, we seeM-45 in India as well as Central Asia apart from Europe.</p>
		<p>Subsequently to the main wave we discussed above, therehave been two more waves known as the I.E. wave and theSaraswathi wave which will be discussed later. M-173 arosefrom M-45 and M-17 from M-173. M-17 is present in Indiaamong I.E. speaking population and also in Eastern Europe. Weshall be able to explain the distribution of M-17 only if weassume that M-17 arose in the I.E. migrants who migratedaround 6,000 B.C. from Kumari towards India and up toEastern Europe and therefore, M-17 is seen in India, CentralAsia and up to the Czec Republic.</p>
		<p>Subsequently, when the Saraswathi started drying up, therewas an exodus of I.E. speaking people to Europe viz. the Celts,the Scythians etc. which will be discussed later. These peoplealso carried the M-17 to Europe but in a slightly different form.M-17 is seen in two different haplogroups <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-603-02">*</a></sup> R1a and R1b. R1bis a later one which has an additional mutation known as M343. Therefore, it is suggested that the migrants around 8,000years ago had R1a and migrants around 5000 years ago haddeveloped the R1b.</p>
		<p>The story of marker M-242 which arose from M-45 isinteresting. According to the Africa model, it arose 15,000 to20,000 years ago in a man born in Siberia. This is animportant marker as far as the Americas are concerned as it isancestral to M-3 and almost all native Americans aredescendants of the M-3 man. If the story had stopped here,the explanation given above as part of the Africa Model wouldbe neat and clean without raising any controversy. But, as statedearlier, an analysis of the M-45 lineage by Spencer Wells andMark Seielstad tells us that M-242 is distributed across Asia fromSouthern India to China to Siberia as well as throughout theAmericas. How the marker 242 (which defines a Siberian clan)and which arose in the cold Siberian climate spread up to SouthIndia seems to be a mystery. Certainly it did not enter Indiathrough the North West corridors which are the favorite injectingpassages for almost every conceivable marker, language, cultureetc from outside. The only possibility seems to be entry intoIndia from the North East. Even if it had entered India throughthe North East, how it can be seen in South India cannot beeasily explained. We know that according to the KumariModel, M-45, which is ancestral to M-242, passed throughIndia. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to postulate that M-242arose in India and then followed the traditional routes to reachChina and ultimately Siberia in a Northward direction (Fig 6.5)</p>
