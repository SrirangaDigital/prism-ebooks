		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">NEOLITHIC WAVE OF MIGRATION</h1>
		<p>So far we have discussed the early waves and the main wavesof migration. We used genetic information as the main pillarof support for those two sets of waves of migration. However,we are lucky so far as the Neolithic Wave is concerned in thatwe can derive additional support from archeology, linguisticsand ‘living history.’</p>
		<p>It is quite a well-known and accepted fact that the M-172marker is associated with the spread of agriculture and is a partof the Neolithic wave of migration around 10,000 years ago.Also it is confirmed that M-172 arose straight from M-89 andnot from its lineages M-9, M-45 etc. This leads us to concludethat M-172 arose from M-89 while the M-89 people were stillin the Kumari continent where the Neolithic Revolution tookplace, and it is these people who migrated with their knowledgeof agriculture to various parts of the world.</p>
		<p>The Neolithic migrants must have passed through India asthe marker M-172 is seen throughout India. Also, M-172 isfound in high frequencies from Pakistan to the Mediterraneanand reaches a peak of 90 percent near the Caucasus. This sortof frequency distribution lends full support to the suggestedtheory of migration of Neolithic farmers as described inChapter 2. The suggestion was that the Neolithic farmers tookthe sea routes to reach the Fertile Crescent through the PersianGulf which eventually became a secondary centre for agriculturalexpansion.</p>
		<p>Similarly, the marker associated with rice cultivation in theEastern side of India is M-122. This marker is seen in Indiaand in many places in East and South-East Asia. While onthe subject of the main waves of migration, we have suggestedthat after M-9 reached India, three other markers arose -M-45, M-20 and M-175. Whereas the M-20 remained in SouthIndia, M-45 and M-175 advanced to far off places to the Westof India and East of India respectively. Therefore, it is quitelogical to assume that M-122, which arose from M-175, spreadall over the East of India. M-122 people mainly propagatedrice cultivation. We have indicated a number of secondarycentres for the expansion of agriculture in the Middle East,South Asia, South-East Asia and East Asia and all these placescame to light because of archeological evidence. From suchevidence we also got confirmation that the transition from anomadic life - style to farming was a sudden change. Therefore,the change was not a local evolution but brought about bypeople who migrated from the place where the knowledge wasfirst developed to new places, most probably through sea routes.As the transition took place more or less simultaneously at somany places, we had concluded that the place of origin wouldhave been a place from which the secondary centres were radiallydispersed, and this place was Kumari Kandam.</p>
		<p>Also, one agricultural group from Kumari Kandam seemsto have reached places beyond the Vindhyas and introduced ricecultivation in these places. As the investigations of these placeare more recent, we can only say that more than 7,500 yearsago there was rice cultivation in these areas in India.</p>
		<p>Genetic evidence has established that M-172 is present fromSouth India to Pakistan to Sumer to the Mediterranean. Thisevidence can only indicate the areas covered by the migrationand not the direction of migration. To determine the path ofmigration we will have to depend on the findings of the latesttwo papers (one by Sangamitra Sahoo and others, and the otherby Dravid Reich and others) where it has been clearly statedthat the Y-chromosomal data consistently suggest a large SouthAsian origin for India caste communities and argue against anymajor influx from the North West of India. Therefore, we cansay that the migration of Neolithic farmers was from Kumarito Pakistan, to Sumer and then to the Mediterranean, andcertainly not in the reverse direction.</p>
		<p>In order to strengthen the conclusions arrived on the basisof genetic data, let us look at the opinion of scholars beforethe advent of Genetics. In the first chapter itself we discussedthis question and found that about a century ago the Dravidianswere considered to be Mediterranean sea people because of manyconnecting factors. The connection pointed out by Lahovarywas the most important one. We also saw that a number ofscholars stated that Dravidians arrived in South India from manyplaces extending from the Basque area in Europe, Middle East,Nepal, Africa, Australia etc. The scholars who had given theiropinion were correct in their observations as they did find astrong connection based on ‘living history’. We have listed sevensuch suggestions in the first chapter and at best only one of themcould have been correct and the others wrong. However, theother six suggestions were also made by outstanding scholarsand therefore, we cannot dismiss their views totally. In fact, theobservations made by every one of them are correct but not theirinterpretation. The readers have seen that when we reverse thedirection of the migration, we find that these scholars had madethe correct observations. Also we found that H.G. Wells,Sangarapillai, K.P. Aravanan, K.P. Appadurai, P. Isaiarasan, andmany others have given sufficient convincing arguments to provethat the Dravidians migrated from South India to other placesand certainly not from other places to South India.</p>
		<p>Brahui is spoken in certain pockets of Baluchistan and itis a Dravidian language. It is worth noting that Mehrgarh isalso in Baluchistan and therefore, Brahui could be a remnantDravidian language of the Neolithic settlers. The Dravidianconnection is not confined to Baluchistan only but we haveconcrete evidence to prove that it extended up to theMediterranean. It was certainly spoken in Elam in SouthWestern Iran. The very name ELAM rings a loud Dravidiantone. The word Elam is part and parcel of Dravidian placesand even present day Sri Lanka was known as Elam. One hasto read the works of my favourite author Sangara Pillai tounderstand the strong connection of Elam with the Dravidians.</p>
		<p>Luca Cavelli Sforza (p. 157) has also identified Brahuispoken in Eastern Pakistan as belonging to the Dravidian family.He further confirms that it was spoken earlier further West -certainly in Elam (South Western Iran) and possibly in the IndusValley. This independent confirmation is more than enough toproclaim that it was the Dravidian - speaking people whocolonized those areas during the Neolithic wave of migration.</p>
		<p>Mesopotamia was the area of the rivers Tigris andEuphrates, covering the larger part of present day Iraq. Sumerwas an early civilization of Mesopotamia before 3,000 B.C. andcontemporary to the civilizations of the Indus Valley and Egypt.Even though there were many political ups and downs, the citiesin the region flourished. One such important city was UR (orOOR) which existed as early as 4th millennium B.C. The Tamilword UR is used for any place of human habitation, and thenames of many villages and towns end with a suffix UR. Forinstance, the village where I was born, the district headquarterswhere it was situated, and the metro where I now live all havenames ending with suffix UR.</p>
		<p>There is an ancient Sumerian legend about a King sendinga messenger to a rival Kingdom to convey an importantmessage. As the journey was tenuous, the messenger forgot partof the message and the incident highlighted the need for writtenmessages. Thus was born the habit of engraving symbols onclay tables so that the messenger could remember the exactwords. The Cuneiform script, inscribed on clay tablets, was ainvention of the Sumerians in 4th Millennium B.C. Subsequentlythe script was adopted by the Persians, Babylonians and Hittites.The script was deciphered during the early nineteenth centuryand the language was Dravidian. There have been manysimilarities between the Dravidians and the Summerians suchas the matrilineal practice, temple architecture etc. As evidenceof the connection between the Sumerians and the Dravidiansis overwhelming and the direction of migration is from the subcontinent to the West (as confirmed by genetic scientists). I haveno hesitation in proposing that the Sumerian civilization wasestablished by Neolithic migrants from Kumari.</p>
		<p>Now let us consider the views of David Frawley in hisbook ‘The Rig Veda and the History of India’ [page 233] says,“Perhaps the Sumerians were another offshoot of India throughsome of its non-Sanskritistic dialects but atleast were stronglyinfluenced by them. The Kingdom of Elam in southwest Iran,whose language had been connected to Dravidian language alsosuggests Ila-Varta in India and perhaps had similar suchconnections. These speculations are a bit far afield and harderto verify, but given what we have set forth are becomingplausible”.</p>
		<p>Based on the above discussion, the migration pattern ofNeolithic farmers from Kumari Kandam is traced in Fig. 6.7.To make comparisons, we have also given the migration patternbased on the Africa Model in Fig 6.6.</p>
		<p>According to the Puranas, the Samudra Mathana (NeolithicRevolution) was the effort of the Devas and the Asuras. Theuse of Vasuki, the great serpent, for churning the Milky Oceanindicate the active co-operation extended by the Nagas. TheNaga element in this exercise is also confirmed by the presenceof Rahu, a Naga sneaking into the Deva line during thedistribution of Amrita by Mohini. It also indicates that theNagas were fair in colour like Devas and therefore, could easilyjoin the Deva line without being detected. Even though in thePuranas, the Nagas were clubbed with the Asuras, it nowbecomes necessary to identify them separately as a dominantgroup. By slightly deviating from the Puranas, we can say thatthe Neolithic Revolution was the combined effort of the Devas,the Asuras and the Nagas. Samudra Manthana was a majoractivity covering many occupational fields and it was impossiblefor everyone to do everything. There must have been divisionof labour, where each group specialized in a certain field ofwork. Therefore, let us investigate whether the evidence offeredby ‘living history’ can help us to understand the specialist activityof each group.</p>
		<p>From the available evidence, the Dravidians seem to havespread agriculture in major parts of India and also in the IndusValley extending up to Sumer and the Mediterranean. Theyalso seem to have domesticated animals like the cow. Fromthe archeological evidence in the Indus valley, Sumer etc. theywere also city planners and industrialists. They were also knownfor their association with the sea and therefore, they were amaritime civilization. That is probably the reasons why theybuilt the sea port at Lothal and had a thriving maritime tradewith other major civilizations of the time.</p>
		<p>The Nagas were also included in domestication of plantsand their field of specialization was rice cultivation. They alsotook special interest in mud pots and took the technology toChina where there is archeological evidence of storing rice inmud pots. Later they developed ceramics in a big way andbecame the pioneers of ceramic technology. They were alsoarchitects who built imposing cities. Most importantly, they wereartistically oriented towards dance and music. This we knownfrom stories about the Apsaras who were inducted into Indra’scourt at the time of the Samudra Manthana. The Devas werenot a part of the Neolithic migrants which consisted of theDravidians and the Nagas. However, as we are discussing thespecialization of individual groups which took part in theNeolithic Revolution, it is better we also discuss the activitiesof the Devas. In Table I in the second chapter we listedmedicine, weapons, alcoholic drinks, Conch and gems as theproduct of the Neolithic Revolution. Apart from these products,there was also development of language, philosophy etc.</p>
		<p>Devas migrated from Kumari alteast 2000 years after theNeolithic wave of migration described in the previous paragraphs.During those 2000 years they would have developed their skillsconsiderably, when they were forced to migrate from Kumari,one major group settled in the Indus-Saraswathi area and theother group proceeded to Europe and settled down there.Subsequently, they were the cause of the intellectual activity inthe Saraswathi heartland in the fields of philosophy, astronomy,medicine, language etc., This resulted in the compilation ofthe Vedas and associated literature, viz the Puranas whichreflected the history of the land, literary works of Aryabhata,Charaka and Sasruta, and the well known Ashatadyaayi ofPanini. The group that settled in Europe developed differently.They concentrated on developing new products such as weapons,alcoholic beverage items of desire such as jewellery etc. Theyexplored the Earth for resources such as metal etc. Even thoughthe developmental activities were slow in the beginning, it pickedup pace in the later years ushering in the well known industrialrevolution. There approach was more materialistic as they hadbetter weapons than the Easterners and this enabled them tosuhjugate major Eastern nations such as India, China etc.</p>
		<p>The Indo-European language group is certainly a big familycovering a very large area in Eurasia. Linguists have identifiedmany other smaller groups. There are also individual languageslike Burushaski spoken in Pakistan which were called `isolates’in that they could not be related to any particular languagegroup. But with more and more research, a clearer pictureseems to be emerging. In Europe there were a number oflanguages which are extinct today and these probably did nothave any Indo-European element in them. This suggests thatthe extinct languages had a pre-Indo-European origin. Ourearlier discussion on languages clearly suggested linguistic linksextending from India to Spain caused by the migrations andsettlements of Neolithic farmers prior to the introduction of thepre-indo-european languages in the area. Apart from the preIndo-European Mediterranean group, linguists have also identifiedanother pre-Indo-European group known as Na-Dene languageswhich includes languages like Navajo of America and SinoTibetan spoken in Eastern Asia from North-East India onwards.Again the name Dene Caucasian has been proposed to covera very large group of langauges like Basque, Caucasian,Sumerian and Burushaski and Na-Dene languages. Theinclusion of Sumerian in this big group is a significant pointerto the fact that Sumerian had a Dravidian link. Can we saythat Dene-Caucasian group has Dravidian link? Let us investigatethis possibility.</p>
		<p>For this we have to travel back in time to the KumariKandam days, between 10,000 years and 20,000 years ago. Theearliest groups being small ones could have not had the luxuryof developing a number of languages. Their language wouldhave been one with a limited number of words and this ledto a lot of limitations in expressing things. To begin with, thecandidates who qualify to be considered as the earliest languageare Tamil and Sanskrit. As the very name suggests, Sanskritis a refined or perfect language and therefore, it cannot be theearlier one. There must have been some other language fromwhich they learnt many things and have been extremelysuccessful in developing the most perfect language. Tamil couldhave been an earlier one because it has sounds like Zh whichare not found in other languages. Similarly, it does not havemany sounds which most of the language have. Therefore,Dravidian is a very strong candidate for consideration as thepre-Indo-European language connecting all the Dene-Caucasiangroup of languages. If this is proved, it will be an event ofmuch greater importance than the announcement made by theCalcutta Judge in the Asiatic Society. It would establish thatthe spread of Dene-Caucasian languages from Spain to Americawas due to the spread of Neolithic settlers during the Neolithicwave of migration around 10,000 years ago.</p>
