		<h1 class="part-title" epub:type="title">INDO-EUROPEAN WAVE</h1>
		<p>The idea of I.E. languages can be traced to the year 1786 whenthe Calcutta Judge, Sir William Jones, addressed the RoyalAsian Society in Calcutta. His finding was that Sanskrit borea close relationship to Greek and Latin, and also possibly toCeltic and Gothic. Even though this similarity was noticedearlier by a Jesuit Priest, only the address of the English Judgehad an impact on the scholarly community of the time. A newlinguistic discipline sprang up and all those languages whichhad similarity with Sanskrit were known as Indo-Europeanlanguages (I.E. languages). As usual, the linguists did not wantto give any importance to Sanskrit and till now they have beentrying to search for a proto-I.E. language as well as its placeof origin. It is this skewed activity which gave rise to the ideaof Aryans. When Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were excavated,a theory was propounded that Aryan nomads from Central Asiabrought Sanskrit to the Indus valley and it is they who wrotethe Vedas etc. This means that the Aryans migrated fromCentral Asia to the Indus Valley which connects the Sanskritspeaking Indians and the I.E. group. The theory was knownas the Aryan Invasion Theory (A.I.T) which is now calledAryan Migration Theory (A.M.T). As explained elsewhere inthe book, many Indian scholars did not accept this view andtill today there is no consensus on the subject.</p>
		<p>People living in the Hindi belt of North India and manyparts of Europe and Central Asia are connected by the I.E.languages. Now it has been established that the same groupof people are also genetically connected as the Y-marker,M-17, is present in most of the I.E. speaking areas. MarkerM-17 happens to be a member of M-45 lineage as shown inFig 6.1. It is present in high frequency from the Czech Republicto Siberia and Southern Russia. It is also present in highfrequency in North India apart from its presence in the Parsispeaking areas of Iran. Therefore, the M-17 marker gives ahandle to revive the hopes of the A.I.T enthusiasts. However,there is enough evidence to prove that the M-17 marker spreadfrom South to North, from India to Europe and then to Siberia.M-17, with an estimated age of 10,000 to 15,000 years, is adescendant of M-173. Marker M-17 can also be called the I.Emarker. Sanskrit is known as Deva Basha. Therefore, it musthave been the language of the Devas who were also called Surasor Aryans. In the previous chapter, we have established thatthe original home of the Devas was in the Kumari continent.Therefore, ancestors of people in the sub-continent, who speakSanskrit related languages, would have had their origin inKumari continent and later migrated to India and further on.We have already discussed one such migration around 40,000years ago. At the time Sanskrit was not fully developed andtherefore, migrants like the Basques did not speak an I.E.language. Now we shall be discussing a migration which tookplace 8,000-7,000 years from now. This group of migrants didnot speak a fully developed Sanskrit language and therefore, wecan speculate that they spoke a proto-language which was themother of all I.E. languages. As the discussion will be aboutthe migration pattern of the I.E. group this wave of migrationbecomes the Indo-European wave of migration. It is this groupof people who migrated around 8,000-7,000 years ago fromKumari and had the marker M-17 in them.</p>
		<p>The frequency distribution of M-17 in different parts of Iranalso seems to suggest this direction of migration. Those livingin the Western half have a low frequency of M-17 whereas thoseliving in Eastern Iran (nearer India) have frequencies like thosein India. Therefore, the possibility of M-17 spreading from Indiatowards Iran cannot be brushed aside easily.</p>
		<p>It has been established that the spread of agriculture andthe spread of I.E language did not take place at the same timeand the spread of I.E languages occurred after the spread ofagriculture. While discussing the spread of agriculture, we havementioned that the non-Aryan population was the first tomigrate through sea routes and started the spread of agriculturefrom Mehrgrah, Jericho etc. Probably, the Aryans lived onKumari islands slightly higher when compared with the nonAryan Islands. As the sea levels were gradually rising, the firstto be affected were the non-Aryans. Therefore, it was only sometime after the migration of the non-Aryans that the Aryans werealso forced to migrate. This wave of Aryans seems to havereached the coastal areas of Gujarat and further up, includingthe sea coasts beyond present day Pakistan. It is this Aryangroup which established itself in the Saraswathi area and beyondthe sub-continent in Southern Russia, Central Asia etc. We cancall this wave as the fifth wave of migration from Kumari.</p>
		<p>From the way the Sankskrit language blossomed in theSaraswathi heartland, most of the eminent scholars must havesettled down on the Indian side. Probably, after the migrationcontact between the Aryans in India and those outside Indiawas probably minimal. Therefore, Aryans outside India, whomigrated in the I.E. wave, were not very much influenced bythe development in the Saraswathi heartland. Thus, thelanguages that developed inside as well as outside India wereon different lines at the same time maintaining their connectionto Sanskrit.</p>
		<p>Regarding the I.E. family of languages and the migrationof people speaking the I.E. languages, there were two unsolvedproblems. The first is regarding the mother of I.E. languagefor which we have established that proto-Sanskrit is the motherof I.E. languages. The second is regarding the fact whetherI.E. people came to India from outside or they migrated fromIndia to other places. To get a clear cut answer to the secondproblem, we rely on the conclusions arrived at in the twoscientific papers (as described below) in addition to the otherevidence discussed earlier.</p>
		<p>The paper by Sangamitra Sahoo et al. titled “A prehistoryof Indian Y chromosomes; Evaluating demic diffusion scenarios”has come out strongly against the ‘Perennial concept’ of importof language, culture and people into India from various placesin the world.’ The authors have stated that the sharing of someY chromosomal haplogroups between India and Central Asianpopulation is most parsimoniously explained by a deepcommon ancestry between the two regions, with the diffusionof some Indian specific lineages Northward. They have alsostated that the Y-chromosomal data consistently suggests alargely South Asian origin for India caste communities andtherefore, argue against any major influx - from regions Northand West of India - of people associated with the developmentof agriculture or in the spread of the Indo-Aryan languagefamily. In their final conclusion they have stated it is notnecessary, based on current evidence to look beyond South Asiafor the origins of the paternal heritage of the majority of theIndians at the time of the onset of settled agriculture. Moreimportantly, they say that the ‘Perennial Concept’ of people,language and agriculture arriving in India through the NorthWest corridor does not hold up to close scrutiny.</p>
		<p>The latest genetic results pertaining to Indian populationwere published in the International weekly journal of science‘Nature’ on 24th September 2009. The findings of the studyconducted by CCMB Hyderabad in collaboration with researchersat Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Healthand the Board Institute of Harvard and MIT were given widemedia publicity. According to an article in ‘THE HINDU’, thestudy showed that all the diverse groups seen spread out in Indiatoday came from two major ancestral populations that aregenetically divergent. The two ancestral populations are theAncestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians(ASI). While the ANI has connections with outside India, theASI does not have such connections. The ANI populationshows 40-80 percent genetic affinity to European population.Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist inmainland India and the indigenous Andaman tribes are ASIrelated without ANI ancestry. The times of India reported thefollowing, “initial settlement took place 65,000 years ago in theAndaman and the ancient South India around the same timewhich led to population growth in this part. At a late stage,40,000 years ago, the ancient North Indian emerged, which inturn led to rise in numbers here. But at some point of timethe ancient north Indian and the ancient south Indian mixedgiving birth to different set of population, and that is thepopulation which exists today.</p>
		<p>Many of the salient points of the study are covered in themedia reports discussed in the previous paragraphs. In addition,I see from the paper that the frequency difference between groupsin India are larger than those prevailing in Europe, reflectingstrong founder effects whose signatures have been maintainedfor thousands of years owing to endogamy. The paper alsostresses that studies have shown that India contains deep-rootedlineage that share no common ancestry with groups outsideSouth Asia for tens of thousands of years.</p>
		<p><strong>The Perennial Concept</strong></p>
		<p>The ‘Perennial concept’ is described in the paper authoredby Sangamitra Sahoo et al. Now let us see how the conceptmanifests in the ‘Out of Africa’ theory. By now, readers shouldbe having a good idea of the important markers that define themigration pattern across the world. As is well known, theIndian sub-continent has most of the markers and it is interestingto see how the ‘Out of Africa’ theory accounts for them. Letus now take up some of the markers and see their origin andmigration as per the ‘Out of Africa’ theory.</p>
		<p><strong>M-130</strong></p>
		<p>Not found in Africa. Seen only from India to Australia,starting at a low 5% in India and becoming more than 50%in Australia. It is explained that the coastal migrants from Africadeveloped this marker during their journey through India.</p>
		<p><strong>M-20</strong></p>
		<p>Found in South India and rarely outside. It is explainedthat it arose outside India and was quietly transported to SouthIndia without any evidence on the way in which this was done.</p>
		<p><strong>M-45</strong></p>
		<p>Found all over India and connects Europe. Central Asiaand also America. As it arose in Central Asia, it is explainedit was shunted into India at a later date.</p>
		<p><strong>M-172</strong></p>
		<p>Neolithic marker which is associated with expansion ofagriculture. Found all over India, Middle East, Mediterraneancountries etc. Believed to have come to India from the FertileCrescent.</p>
		<p><strong>M-17</strong></p>
		<p>Found in North India, Central Asia, Eastern Europe etc.Believed to have come to India from outside through theinvading Aryans who are supposed to have massacred theDravidians (A.I.T).</p>
		<p><strong>M-242</strong></p>
		<p>Descendant of M-45 arose in Central Asia or Siberia.Found across Asia from Southern India to China to Siberia aswell as Americas. How it came to India from Siberia is amystery.</p>
		<p><strong>M-122</strong></p>
		<p>Associated with agriculture in the East and South East Asiafound in India. How it came to India is not clearly explained.</p>
		<p><strong>Mt DNA Cluster M</strong></p>
		<p>Very old and found in India in a high frequency. TheAfrica theory suggests that it came to India along with coastalmigrants.</p>
		<p>The readers can clearly see that India is considered as adumping ground for markers according to the Africa theory.Fortunately, the two recent papers one by Sagamitra Sahoo etal and the other by David Reich, et al, blasts the notion of Indiabeing the dumping ground for markers. Especially the paperby Sangamitra Sahoo objects squarely to the ‘Perennial Concept’which has been thrust into Indian history for almost twocenturies. Readers can get a rough idea of migrations ofmodern humans based on the Africa Model from Fig 6.8.</p>
		<p>According to the ‘Out of Africa’ Model most of themigrations were from outside into India through the North Westcorridor except for the very early migrations along the coastalhighway. In the ‘Kumari Model’ most of the migrations havebeen from South to North and the migrants reached Iran,Southern Russia, Central Asia etc. through the Bolon andKhyber passes and through sea routes. This means that thedirections of migration have been diametrically opposite betweenthe two models. A rough idea of migrations as per the KumariModel is given in Fig 6.9. We have so far identified manydefects in the ‘Out of Africa’ model whereas the Kumari Modeltallies with every piece of evidence without any difficulty. Asa final exercise, let us now look at the ‘living history’ aspectand see how the Kumari Model fares. No other aspect of‘living history’ is more important than the diversity that is seenin India which we will discuss in the following paragraphs.</p>
		<p>Let us now look at the enormous cultural diversity in thesub-continent which will re-enforce our view that migration havebeen from India to other places such as Middle East, WesternEurope, Southern Russia, Siberia etc. It is needless to point outthat culture is similar to the genome because they accumulateinformation from generation to generation. As a youngster, Iwas aware of the strong critical views of Western visitors toIndia regarding the natives of India. In those days, the word‘natives’ was used to convey the inferior status of Indians.Usually such Westerners visiting India were of a single religionwith stereotype religious practices. Mostly, the Englishmenvisiting India were used to a single language. Further, theirsocial customs, starting from the dress they wore, were of a singletype. Therefore, when they landed in India they were shockedto see the vast diversity which prompted them to ridicule theIndian society as they imagined themselves to be superior beingsas they were used to a stereotype form of customs and practices.The average Englishman thought he saw a sort of unculturedinferior humans and he was certain that this country would goto the dogs if allowed to become free. All in all, he wasdisgusted to see myriad languages, far too many religious sectsand worst of all, he saw people who were not dressed properlyaccording to his standards. It is worth remembering that SirWinston Churchill called Mahatma Gandhi a ‘naked fakir’.Rather than finding fault with such Westerners, what I wantto convey is that India is a land of cultural diversity which isnot seen in any other part of the world. How many languages,how many religions, how many castes, how many Gods andGoddesses, how many forms of dress, how many types of foods,how many forms of music etc., only a native Indian will beable to understand and appreciate. The fact that there are 5,000communities (approx.) 325 functioning languages with 25different scripts proclaims the diversity of India, loud and clearly.Therefore, no one can question the existence of uncomparablediversity in India. All great scholars have opined that Africahas the oldest population based on the genetic diversity theyhave noticed. According to Luca Cavelli Sforza, genetic buildup and cultural build up are quite similar. Therefore, theconclusion arrived at in respect of genetic diversity is equallyapplicable to cultural diversity and India’s cultural build up hasbeen going on for a period longer than in the case of any othergroup of people in the world. Therefore, if at all there has beenmovement of people between India and other place, the directionof migration would have been only from India to the otherplace and certainly not the other way around.</p>
