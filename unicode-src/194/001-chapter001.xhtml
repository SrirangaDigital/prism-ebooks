		<p>Monday, April 26, 2010. A look at the sky in the morning prom ised another hot and sunny day for Bangalore. Nevertheless, I had an appointment. Therefore, I hopped into an autoriksha to go to the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) at Koramangala, about 12 kms from home. At the IIA Dr. D.C.V. Mallik, a senior astronomer was waiting to take me on a visit to the Vainu Bappu Observatory at Kavalur, North Arcot district in Tamil Nadu, about 175 kms southeast of Bangalore. With a keen sense of the history of science, and desire to communicate science to common man in its proper perspective, he has been educating me for almost a year on the finer aspects of astronomy and guiding me in my ambitious project of writing the biography of Prof. Vainu Bappu. This trip to the Observatory was a part of it.</p>
		<p>Driving on the four-lane national highway 7 for almost two hours, we take a deviation at Krishnagiri and pass through several small towns of Tamil Nadu like Bargur, Natrampalli, Vaniyambadi, and finally Alangayam. From then on starts the vast stretch of land known as Javadi hills, the sandalwood forest of Tamil Nadu, situated at an altitude of about 800 meters. Tribal groups in small villages, of which Kavalur is one, inhabit it. Vainu Bappu had roamed this wilderness for several months with a telescope in his hand to select a suitable location for his dream project - a large stellar observatory said Dr. Mallik. Vainu Bappu was so impressed with this site that he wrote, two decades later in a hand-written note, “KAVALUR in the Javadi Hills of Tamil Nadu, where the lone eagle soars high in the clean sky, the peahen struts glamorously in her surroundings and where astronomers of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics probe the major mysteries of the universe........”</p>

		<p>Driving another 11 kilometers on the serpentine road through the forest, we finally arrive at a small gate manned by a single sentry. On a small black granite block to the right is inscribed – <strong>“Indian Institute of Astrophysics – Vainu Bappu Observatory”</strong> Another board to the left invites public on every Saturday between 2 to 5 PM to take a peep in to the skies above.</p>
		<p>Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO) is nested in an area of about 100 acres in the thick forest. It is a credit to its creator that much of the wilderness is retained while narrow roads connect the various cute buildings- the mess, the laboratories, the generator, the liquid nitrogen plant, the sports club and other buildings housing telescopes with aperture sizes ranging from as small as 15 cm to as big as 2.34 meter. The power of a telescope is measured by the diameter of the aperture or the objective (lens or mirror). Larger is the aperture, greater is the amount of light it can collect from the heavenly objects and better is the image of fainter objects.</p>

		<p>It was 12-30 P.M. when we arrived there. After a brief rest and quick lunch at the astronomers’ dining hall - Menakawe headed towards the star attraction- the 2.34 meter Vainu Bappu telescope – the biggest in India. It was entirely designed and built by Indian astronomers and engineers. The only telescope I had seen till then was of the size we see in science exhibitions – either hand held or at best, a stand-mounted one. But this one is a giant! It is housed in a huge building, cylindrical in shape and more than 100 feet tall, capped with an imposing dome, painted glittering white. I t is structured into four floors. The ground floor contained the air-conditioning plant, electrical distribution, and the aluminizing plant - a facility where the telescope mirror is coated once a while with a thin layer of aluminum for good reflection. The first floor contained the electrical and instrumentation laboratories and the library. The second floor was the computer center. The third and the fourth floors are the observation floors with the telescope, the telescope control room and the spectrograph room. The third floor opens to a catwalk, about four feet wide, running around the building. Astronomers often stand here to admire the panoramic view of the vast stretch of the Javadi Hills, to take a breath of fresh air, or to visually inspect the sky conditions for telescopic observations.</p>

		<p>The telescope itself is a huge instrument, measuring more than 30 feet from end to end and weighing several tons. It is pivoted on two big concrete pillars. The person who was showing us around, Mr. Gabriel, proudly pointed out at the pillars and said that they were cast separately with foundation going far deeper than that of the building itself. He explained that with such a structure even if some thing happens to the building, say as in an earthquake, nothing would happen to the telescope itself. Gabriel has all the reasons to be proud of it. Now at 60, he had been there as a 19-year-old boy and has grown with the telescope. Another specialty of the structure is that the floors are removable. This enables easy transport of the 2.34-meter mirror, each time it has to be taken for aluminizing or for any other servicing.</p>
		<p>The telescope tube is so big that a person can actually sit inside at the prime focus and record images. The whole telescope, m ounted on two hydraulic supports, can majestically swing north-south and east-west. The dome covering the entire structure opens up like a sliding door to allow starlight to reach the mirror. Mounted on huge rails, the dome can rotate by 360 degrees. Coupling the two movements through the computer, astronomers can view any part of the night sky.</p>
		<p>We then headed to see the German made 1-meter Zeiss telescope, another jewel in the VBO. At the press of a button the shutters open and the dome rotates. We see the graceful lines of the telescope as it moves to take up a position parallel to the earth’s axis of rotation. This telescope was associated with some very interesting discoveries immediately after it was installed in the 1970s.</p>
		<p>Later in the afternoon, we went around the huge VBO campus. Shri P. Anbazhagan, who accompanied us showed some young sandalwood saplings here and there. However, there were no mature trees. They were all poached long back. But, the campus is not bare. It is filled with various types of flowering trees from the luxurious Bougainvillea to alluring Jacaranda with its purple flowers. Vainu Bappu himself planted many of these different types of trees in a planned manner so that all through the year there will be some of them blooming. And Bappu particularly loved the purple Jacaranda.</p>
		<p>It was the same fate with the wild animals that once roamed the vast forestland. Anbazhagan said that in the early days, standing on the catwalk they could see during nights pairs of bright shining eyes behind the distant bushes. They were of the spotted deers. Now they are rare. Only large anthills looking like sages sitting for meditation can be seen.</p>

		<p>Before leaving Bangalore, Dr. Mallik had told me to carry a torch. My first reaction was, may be to take care of the power shutdowns. But that is not so. The Vainu Bappu Telescope is a stellar telescope, essentially to observe distant objects like stars, galaxies, nebulae. Unlike solar observations, stellar observations are carried out only during nights. Stellar astronomers are nocturnal creatures, active only from dusk to dawn. Since starlight is very faint, light pollution is an im portant interfering factor in stellar observatories. Nights are eerie on this campus! All windows and doors in houses are draped with thick curtains. No streetlights are lit. For moving around in the night, every one carries a small torch occasionally illuminating the path.</p>
		<p>I overheard an interesting conversation at the dining table that night. A new student who had just arrived from Lucknow was not used to this darkness. He said he is not afraid of snakes but ghosts, and cannot make out people from ghosts in the darkness. Some one quipped, “It is easy. Ghosts don’t carry torches!”</p>
		<p>After dinner, we went back to the Vainu Bappu Telescope building to witness a stellar observation. We entered the lift (there was light in the lift) and pressed button 3 to go to the observation floor. As the lift crossed the second floor, light in the lift went out. I thought it was a power cut and we were stuck in the lift. No. The lift was moving and the door opened at the third floor. The lift was programmed that way to prevent light pollution in the observation floor!</p>
		<p>There were no lights in the observation floor. In the darkness, people recognize each other by voice rather than by face. Even in the telescope control room, only torches were used. Unfortunately, (for the astronomer) it was the eve of full moon night. The moon light was interfering with their observation and the sky was partly cloudy at the direction they wanted to look up. While they were struggling to lock the telescope on to a star, I stood on the catwalk and enjoyed the quiet night. Standing there, I could see the entire Javadi Hills bathed in cool moon light- an ethereal sight! Finally, they were able to produce a spectrogram of a star with its dark absorption lines and bright emission lines. I was excited, for I had seen such spectrograms only in textbooks.</p>
		<p>We returned to our rooms late in the night. Handing over the key to my room, Dr. Mallik, with a smile on his lips, said that it is a special room. I asked him what is special about it. He said, “This was Bappu’s room. He stayed here during his visits to Kavalur. During his time the room was only used by him and occasionally by visiting VIPs”. I was thrilled. However, the old furniture was changed in 1986 when Shri Rajiv Gandhi, then PM of India, visited Kavalur to see Halley’s comet and also name the place as Vainu Bappu Observatory and to dedicate it to the nation. He too used this room for one night.</p>

		<p>It was an elegant, neat and tiny room with two windows opening into the wilderness outside. Gentle moon light was stream ing through them, giving an unearthly experience. As I rested in the room for the night where Bappu had dreamt m any a dream s, the m an and his achievements as told by dozens of people – his wife, colleagues, students and friends, started slowly unfurling in my mind.</p>
