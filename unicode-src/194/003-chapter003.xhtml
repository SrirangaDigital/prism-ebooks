		<p>Vainu could not have asked for anything better. For, at Harvard he found himself among an ideal group of young men guided by the ablest teachers of that time. Prof. Shapley was one of them.</p>

		<p>On the first day he landed in Boston, Bappu straight away went to Prof. Shapley’s house and rang the bell. Mrs. Shapley opened the door and was surprised to see an unknown young man at the door. She told the Professor about it. Prof. Shapely immediately recognized him and made him feel comfortable. He told him that there was a dinner party that night for all students and faculty of the Harvard College and Bappu would attend that. At the party all the professors were seated in one place and the students in another. While the dinner was in progress, Prof. Shapley sent him a note saying that he should give a talk after the dinner. At this sudden and unexpected assignment, Bappu felt ‘butterflies’ in his stomach! But then, he had to do it. He picked up a piece of paper and noted a few points. After the dinner, Prof. Shapley announced that they have a new student from India and he will give a talk. Bappu was a voracious reader, a good orator and was fluent in English. He rose to the occasion and delivered his m aiden speech, at the end of which the entire hall applauded enthusiastically. Prof. Shapley went to him, patted on his back, and congratulated him. In fact, Bappu used to say later that the other professors used to talk about it for quite some time.</p>
		<p>Harlan J. Smith, who joined Harvard College at the sam e tim e as Bappu did, later becam e the Director, McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas. He had the privilege of knowing Vainu more closely than any one else for the next three decades. Recalling those days he writes, “In January 1949 we entered the Harvard Graduate School of Astronomy- entered with trepidation yet excitement to be studying in the halls peopled with memories of the likes of Bond and Pickering, and the very real presence of Shapley, Bok, Payne-Gaposchkin, Menzel and Whipple. His spirit was generous, kind and non-cynical – even heroworshiping in the best sense of the word. He deeply admired, if not even venerated his teachers and those living and dead, who had really accomplished something. He well knew and understood human frailties, but to Vainu the important things were those qualities and works of great men and women which should be admired and emulated as far as possible in his own life. Then, as now, it was fashionable for graduate students to work very hard and we did – some times tired and discouraged. I recall an occasion walking with Vainu late one winter night, our conversation turning to whether we might ever get jobs or amount to anything in astronomy------. But Vainu was not to be depressed easily. He brightened up and quoted the poem “IF” by Kipling, the spirit of which is that he who raises his head against all odds is the real winner. Vainu’s mantra then and throughout the rest of his career was “I can and I will.”</p>

		<p>He was so much focused on astronomy that Harlan J. Smith writes, “Vainu never wanted to miss a session of the American Astronomical Society. So we went to all of them.” However, they never had enough money to meet the expenses. Therefore, they literally “spent nights on the lawns of host observatories in our war-surplus sleeping bags. Hot or cold, hungry, mosquitoes- Vainu never complained, and usually managed to bring the conversation around astronomy”.</p>
		<p>It was not that Vainu was always studious and serious. Harlan Smith continues, “He laughed and joined in most of the gam es and jokes. He found the necessary paraphernalia and organized at the observatory what must have been the only cricket team within a few hundred miles, teaching us the mysteries of sticky wickets and googly balls. On one occasion, he gaily commented on some virtues of Yoga to the amused condescension of some of the other graduate students. Therefore, he inveigled me into a scientific test. We both stood on our heads (one form of Yoga) for ten or fifteen minutes before each major examination. And that year, we two were the only students to pass them all QED! (But Vainu was too gentle even to rub it in)”.</p>
		<p>Then there were other academic challenges to face. Vainu was not just a daydreamer, but worked hard to produce results. Within months after joining Harvard, he had discovered a comet!</p>

		<p>Comets have fascinated humans ever since they first noticed them with bright, distinctive tails streaking across the night sky. In ancient times, their appearance was thought to portend im pending disasters to m ankind. Today astronomers know that they are made up of frozen gas such as methane, carbon dioxide and ice, which are also found in the interstellar space. Hence, they are considered to be part of the pre-solar nebula and have remained unaltered in composition since the beginning of the solar system. Therefore, studying comets astronomers gain insight into the early history of the formation of the solar system. Sometimes gravitational field of nearby stars pushes the comets to descend towards the Sun in a highly elliptical or parabolic orbit. While some are periodic like the famous Halley’s Comet, which appears once in every 76 years, others m ay not appear a second tim e at all. As a com et approaches the Sun several distinct features like its tail appear and the comet can be seen with the aid of binoculars. Since they are pieces of our solar system’s past, their position, apparent brightness and the color of light emitted all can tell us a great deal about how the solar system was formed and how old it is. Hence, astronomers spend hundreds of hours gazing at the sky to discover new comets and glean as much information as possible.</p>
		<p>As a part of training in astronomy, Bappu was taking routinely night sky pictures. According to the Harvard Crimson, a daily newspaper of the University, on July 2 1949, Bappu exposed a photographic plate to the early morning northern sky. Normally such plates are sent to the main campus in Cam bridge for processing. But his professor Bart Bok suggested that Bappu develop the plate in the observatory itself. After developing the plate Bappu announced,” Now I am going to look for comets” and indeed spotted a faint dot in the Cygnus constellation. Along with his colleague Gordon Newkirk and Prof. Bok, Bappu followed its movement in the subsequent days and confirmed that it was indeed a comet.</p>
		<p>From several of Bappu’s plates taken on successive nights they com puted the comet’s orbital param eters. Years later, commenting on this, Prof. V. Radhakrishnan, editor of the Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy says, “More than the discovery itself, his achievement was in computing its orbit immediately, ahead of more experienced professionals”. His calculations showed that the comet’s orbit is so large that it is visible only once in 60,000 years! It is too bad that we will not be able to see Bappu’s comet again in our lifetimes.</p>

		<p>It is generally the custom to name the comets after the discoverers. Hence, the International Astronomical Union officially designated the comet as <strong>C/1949N1 (Bappu-BokNewkirk)</strong>. As the first discoverer, Vainu was awarded the Donohoe Comet Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1949. Joseph A. Donohoe, a wealthy businessman from San Francisco had endowed in 1890 that the medal be awarded to the discoverer of each new comet. However, with the improvements in telescopes and other instruments used in astronomy comet discovery became, in the later years, so common that the award was discontinued after 1950. By that time, as many as 250 medals were already given away.</p>

		<p>Now, these medals are a proud collector’s item. It is interesting to note that while thousands of comets have been discovered as of today, C/1949N1 is the only comet that was discovered by an Indian and bears an Indian name.</p>
		<p>A comic incident occurred exposing the ignorance of the Indian bureaucracy of that time. The news of this discovery soon reached I ndia. But there were no congratulatory messages coming from the government (unlike in the case of winning even a bronze medal in Olympic Games or a cricket trophy these days), though no other Indian had been credited with such a discovery before. On the other hand, the Government of Hyderabad, which had given the scholarship to Bappu to do research in astronomy at Harvard, felt he was wasting his precious time discovering comets! Therefore, it sent a telegram to the Indian embassy in Washington requesting to advise the student to undertake research according to the terms and conditions of his scholarship. The embassy promptly sent a letter to Bappu reprimanding him for his discovery and advising him to “see that your government’s wishes are carried out in every respect”.</p>
		<p>Fred Whipple, one of the professors at Harvard wrote back to the embassy describing the importance of such background training for doctoral studies and the significance of Bappu’s discovery. Whipple wrote that if the student had failed to notice this unusual object on his photographic plate, it would have been “a sin of scientific observation” and if he had failed to announce the discovery, it would have been a “serious neglect of his duty to the scientific world”.</p>
		<p>This exchange of letters has been preserved in the archives of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, founded by Bappu later.</p>
		<p>Bappu completed Ph.D degree from Harvard University in record time of three years, in 1952. For his thesis, he had carried out spectroscopic studies of Wolf-Rayet stars. WolfRayet stars are a class of stars discovered by two astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet. They are massive stars (more than 20 times the mass of Sun) with a high surface temperature in the range of 25,000 to 50,000 degree Kelvin. The striking peculiarity of these stars is that they display broad emission lines in addition to the usual dark absorption lines on an otherwise continuous spectrum. Among the billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy one can find only 100 to 150 stars of that type. Hence, they have been the subject of intense study.</p>

		<p>After Ph.D., Bappu was offered the prestigious Carnegie Fellowship in astronomy. Even here, he was the first Indian to have been offered that Fellowship. This gave him an opportunity to have access to the 200-inch telescope installed on the Palomar Mountain near San Diego, California. That was the largest optical telescope at that time. The power of a telescope is measured by the diameter of the objective lens or mirror: larger the diameter, more the light it can gather from the object under study. Hence, the image produced will be brighter with a better resolution. So, with larger telescopes it would be possible to peep deeper into space. Galileo used only a three-inch telescope to make the seminal discoveries of the moons of planet Jupiter, which opened up the field of observational of astronomy. One can then imagine the kind of details that can be observed from such large telescopes. Working there for two years, Bappu came out with an important discovery, which etched his name permanently in the annals of astronomy.</p>
		<p>What was this discovery and how did it usher in new methods for probing the stars? To answer this question we have to consider briefly some developments in physics in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
