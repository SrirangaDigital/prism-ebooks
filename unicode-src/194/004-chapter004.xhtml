		<p>When we look at the night sky, some stars appear bright, some faint, some are yellow in color, some red, some blue, and so on. Let us first examine how Sun and other stars emit light.</p>
		<p>In daily life, we express temperatures either in degree Celsius or in degree Fahrenheit. For example, we express the day’s temperature in degree Celsius and the temperature of the human body in degree Fahrenheit. However, in astronomy and physics, a third scale, called the absolute temperature scale or the “Kelvin” (K) scale, is used. Named after the Irish-born Scottish scientist Lord Kelvin, it measures an object’s temperature above absolute zero, the physically conceivable coldest temperature. At absolute zero, all atomic and molecular motions cease. (Zero on the Celsius or the Fahrenheit scale is not the lowest temperature conceivable). On the Kelvin scale, the freezing point of water is 273-degree K. Room tem perature (27 degree C) is 300 degree K (273+27=300).</p>
		<p>The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 19 th century showed that oscillating electric and magnetic fields generate electromagnetic waves, which propagate through free space at the speed of light. Light itself was shown to be nothing but electrom agnetic waves over a narrow interval of wavelengths, from 330 nm (nanometer- one billionth of a meter) to 700 nm approximately. It was further noticed that any opaque body heated to an equilibrium tem perature emitted electrom agnetic radiation with a characteristic spectrum independent of other physical characteristics and chemical composition of the body. This radiation from a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is called “blackbody radiation”. In principle, it is emitted over all wavelengths - from the long wavelength radio waves to microwaves to infrared to visible light to shorter wavelengths like ultraviolet light, X-rays and each having very definite properties.</p>
		<p>In fact, in the history of physics, blackbody radiation occupies an important milestone. In the late 19 th century, physicists had concluded that they knew everything of what was to be known about the laws of Nature and future research would only fine-tune that knowledge. However, when they tried to explain the blackbody radiation spectrum, they hit a roadblock! Application of the existing theories could describe only parts of the spectrum and not the whole. At that time, Max Planck, a German scientist, made a radical assumption that radiation is emitted not in the form of a continuous train of waves as was assumed until then, but as a stream of individual “energy packages” or “quanta”.</p>

			<p>Max Plank was born in 1858 in Kiel, Germany. As a student he was advised against taking physics for higher studies. His professor said, “in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes.”</p>
			<p>Decades later, he did more than fill a hole. By applying Ludwig Bollzman’s statistical approach to thermodynamics and assuming that radiation is emitted in discrete quanta, he could account for the entire black body radiation and started a new branch of Physics – the quantum mechanics.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong><em>Mechanism of blackbody radiation emission</em></strong></p>
			<p>How does a blackbody emit radiation? Emission of radiation is caused by various microscopic interactions between particles, e.g., atoms, ions and molecules, which make up any object. We know that every object is made up of atoms and molecules of one or more different types of chemical elements. Atoms in turn are made up of positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons that orbit around the nuclei. As a whole, they are electrically neutral. Air consists predominantly of atoms of oxygen and nitrogen; water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.</p>
			<p>These atoms are always in motion and colliding with each other. Temperature of an object is nothing but the average energy of motion of the atoms constituting the object. In a hot object, the atoms move more rapidly and have higher average energy of motion. On the other hand, in a cool object they move rather slowly and have lower energy of motion. As atoms collide with each other, they exchange energy. Heat is generated in rapid collisions. W hen atoms collide at high velocities, they may knock off electrons from each other. However, these electrons cannot remain free for long time. They soon recombine with positively charged ions and in doing so they emit radiation. In addition, when electrons whiz past ions without being captured, they emit radiation. There are many more such microscopic processes in which radiation is generated. These radiations, in turn, may be absorbed by other atoms exciting them to emit radiations or ionizing them by setting free the electrons. In an object in thermodynamic equilibrium, the emission and absorption processes exactly balance each other and radiation is trapped in the interior of the object, and there is no net flow of energy from one region to another. But, the radiation from the surface always escapes and its characteristics are determined by the equilibrium temperature of the object. This is the blackbody radiation.</p>
		</div>
		<p>These energy packages of radiation are also called photons and the energy of a photon is nothing but the frequency of the radiation multiplied by a constant named the Planck constant. The Planck constant is one of the fundamental constants of Nature like the universal constant of gravitation and the electronic charge. Based on the concept of quanta, Planck developed a theory, which could describe the entire blackbody spectrum. From this was born a new branch of physics called quantum physics, which was the forerunner of the new physics of the 20<sup>th</sup> centuryquantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, electronics and so on, the fruits of which we are enjoying today.</p>
		<p>The distribution of intensity of the radiation at various wavelengths depends only upon the temperature of the object when it is emitting like a blackbody. For example, if a piece of iron is heated to about 600 degree K, it becomes red hot, that is, the radiation it emits peaks in a wavelength range corresponding to red light. I n an incandescent bulb, when the electrical energy heats up the tungsten filament to a temperature of about 3000 degree K, radiation at other wavelengths corresponding to yellow, green and blue colors are also em itted in substantial amounts and together they make the bulb glow white. Matter heated to millions of degrees can emit even shorter wavelength radiations like ultraviolet and X-rays.</p>
		<p>Even the human body at normal temperature (37 degree C or 310 degree K) emits thermal radiation in the infrared region. Though infrared radiation is invisible to the human eye, special instruments, called thermographs, can capture an infrared image of the body, which can be used for many diagnostic purposes. Infrared radiation has profound applications in astronomy also.</p>
		<h2>Stellar Glow</h2>
		<p>Is it not amazing that the physical laws discovered on Earth are applicable everywhere in the universe? It is the same processes we are familiar with in the laboratory, that are taking place in the Sun and other stars to make them emit light with intensities far exceeding anything we can create on Earth. It is to be noted that the Sun and other stars have been shining for billions of years! Two interesting questions pop up here. What in the first place, heats up the stellar objects to such high temperatures (several thousands of degree Kelvin) and how is it sustained for such long durations? The answers to these questions lay essentially in the story of the structure and evolution of stars.</p>
		<p>Unlike the Earth, a star is a ball of gas, composed mostly of hydrogen, a little helium and traces of some heavier elements. If so, how does a star retain its structure and not dissipate like a puff of gas coming out of a chimney? It is because this collection of gas is different in a very important way - its total mass. Even the Sun, only a medium sized star is 300,000 times more massive than the Earth. This huge mass produces a large gravitational field, which pulls the atoms of the gas together to form a spherical ball of gas. The gravitational force is always directed to the center of this sphere. In that case, the entire gas should collapse into a small ball. But, that does not happen. Another force comes into play to prevent the gas from shrinking too m uch. As the ball of gas contracts, it releases gravitational energy, a part of which heats up the gas. As the temperature of the gas rises, so does its pressure. The pressure counteracts the inward pull of the gas and prevents the ball of gas from collapsing. Since the gravitational force increases towards the center, the gas too has to have higher pressure to balance the gravity and it becomes hotter and hotter. The balance between pressure forces and the gravitational force gives the star its stability. Near the center of the gas sphere, the “core”, the pressure and density of the gas is very high, with the density reaching a value of about 134 gm per cubic centimeter (compare this with the density of air - 0.001293 gm per cubic centimeter) and the temperature shoots up to 15 million degree K!</p>
		<p>Under these conditions, a new phenom enon takes place in the core. All the different atoms making up the gas are stripped of their electrons and the gas is composed of bare nuclei and electrons. As the nuclei collide or scatter past one another at a very close range with high enough velocities, some other forces, known as nuclear forces, come into play. They overcome the repulsive electrostatic force between the nuclei and make them merge into one another. This process is known as nuclear fusion. In a series of fusion reactions, four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus and release energy. Though the energy released in a single fusion reaction is too small to heat such a large mass of gas, there are about 10<sup>38</sup>it up to as high as 5800 degree K and makes the Sun glow. Astronomers have estimated that in one second the Sun emits more energy than humans have used ever since the beginning of civilization! And remember that Sun is only a medium sized star. such fusion reactions taking place every second in the core of the Sun, turning about 600 tons of hydrogen to helium and releasing an enormous amount of energy. This energy slowly diffuses out from the center to the surface layer of the Sun heating it up to as high as 5800 degree K and makes the Sun glow. Astronomers have estimated that in one second the Sun emits more energy than humans have used ever since the beginning of civilization! And remember that Sun is only a medium sized star.</p>

		<p>Thus, we see that the entire mass of gas, which we call the Sun, is sizzling with heat and emitting radiation. Though the inner layers are hotter and produce a higher flux of radiation, very little of it can escape because of the higher density of gas in those layers, which make the gas opaque. What we see as the light from the Sun, is the radiation emitted from the outer surface, which is about 500 km thick. Astronomers call this layer the ‘photosphere’. The sun emits like a blackbody at an effective temperature of about 5800 degree Kelvin.</p>
		<p>Based on the abundance of hydrogen in the Sun’s core and the rate of fusion reactions, astronomers estimate that the Sun has been glowing for the past four and half billion years and will continue to do so for another four to five billion years! When all the hydrogen fuel is used up in fusion reactions, gravity will start dominating again and the Sun will start on a long journey towards its eventual demise.</p>
		<p>It is more or less the same story with other stars, with some variations in the chain of nuclear fusion reactions that take place inside them.</p>
