		<p>It is a common experience that when sunlight passes through a prism , it splits into the various colors of the rainbow. It tells us that white light is a combination of several colors, each represented by a specific wavelength. In fact, it was Isaac Newton who, in 1666, first demonstrated this wonderful splitting of sunlight. What we see after the light passes through the prism is known as the spectrum of the incident light. The rainbow that forms across the sky when sunlight is intercepted by water droplets in the cloud is the most beautiful natural spectrum we know.</p>
		<p>All astronomical objects tell their stories through the language of the radiation they emit, which the astronomers have learned over the years to read and interpret. A study of the distribution of colors and their intensity in starlight is known as stellar spectroscopy.</p>
		<p>Astronomers use devices known as spectrometers, attached to telescopes, to analyze the light from the Sun and other stars to reveal their manifold glory. Light collected from the telescope objective (lens or mirror) is passed through one or more prisms to achieve maximum spread of colors. Modern spectrometers use diffraction gratings in place of prisms. A diffraction grating is a device with thousands of microscopic lines cut on a glass surface (transmission gratings) or thousands of parallel grooves ruled on a mirror (reflection gratings). The result is a multi-slit arrangement and light incident on it gets diffracted, different wavelengths diffracting at slightly different angles. This makes the light to spread into a spectrum.</p>
		<p>The separated colors are then recorded on a photographic plate or an electronic detector known as a charge coupled device (CCD). A CCD contains millions of light sensitive diodes on a small area. It is more sensitive than a photographic plate and the data can be transferred directly to a computer memory for later analysis.</p>
		<p>Light from the Sun and other stars is essentially a blackbody spectrum, a continuous distribution of intensities as a function of wavelength that follows the Planck formula. The spectrum extends to both sides of the visible radiation, that is to infrared and radio waves on the longer wavelength side, and to the ultraviolet, X-rays on the shorter wavelength side. The wavelength of visible light, say green light, is of the order of 0.0000005 meters. It is awkward to express such short lengths in meters with so many decimals. So it is expressed in terms of nanometers (1 nm = 10<sup>-9</sup> meters). On this scale, visible light ranges from 400 to 700nm with green around 500 nm; on the longer wavelength side infrared radiation has the wavelength from 700nm to about 0.1cm and radio waves from 0.1cm to several meters or more. On the shorter wavelength side ultraviolet radiation ranges from 400 nm to about 10 nm and further on in the spectrum are X-rays. However, except visible light and radio waves, most other radiations are blocked by the atmosphere of the Earth and do not reach the ground.</p>

			<p>A compact disk (CD) is a good example of a crude reflection grating. W hen held against bright sunlight one can see the various colors. Similarly, a fine feather can function as a crude transmission grating. There is an interesting story about Prof. C.V. Raman. One might have seen that after the first monsoon rain a type of insects come out in large numbers and are attracted to streetlights. They hit the lamp and in the process shed their feathers. On one such evening, Prof. Raman was found picking up those little feathers and putting them into his pocket. An acquaintance who was passing by was very much amused. He asked the professor what he is doing. Prof. Raman said, “You see these fine feathers act as nice transmission gratings. Tomorrow I have to talk to school children about diffraction of light. I will give each one a feather and ask them to look at a light source through it. They will see the rings of various colors.”</p>

		<p>The relative intensities of different wavelengths in the spectrum depend upon the temperature of the stellar surface - the photosphere. In the case of the Sun, the most intense radiation is emitted in the visible region and our atmosphere permits them to reach the ground.</p>
		<h3>Reading Between Lines</h3>
		<p>The spectral features of light emerging from a star are further modified in some important ways. As early as 1802, an English chemist William Hyde had noticed some dark lines superposed over the bright solar continuum. A German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer rediscovered these lines in 1814 and studied their features in detail and hence they came to be known as Fraunhofer lines. Later, two other German scientists Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen suggested that these lines are caused by the absorption of certain specific wavelengths of the solar continuum by elements present in the upper layers of the Sun.</p>

		<p>The star’s atmosphere contains atoms and ions of various elements, which make up the star. At the prevailing temperatures of the outer layers, these atoms and ions are at various stages of excitation. They can thus absorb radiation at their characteristic wavelengths and get further excited. Absorption am ounts to rem oval of radiation from the outward-directed continuous radiation coming from the deeper layers underneath. The observed spectrum on Earth thus shows the continuum interrupted by dark lines at the specific wavelengths where absorption has occurred. Therefore these dark lines are also known as “absorption lines”.</p>
		<p>Any excitation is followed by a de-excitation and emission of photons at the same characteristic wavelength. However, the emission process is isotropic, which means it is not just in the direction of the observer, but in all directions. Therefore, only a few photons appear in the direction of the telescope. Hence, they cannot be seen in the background of the bright continuous spectrum. However, if the light of the bright photosphere could somehow be blocked (this happens for the Sun during a total solar eclipse), the emission is seen as bright lines at the corresponding wavelengths on a dark background. These are known as ‘emission lines’. Since emission and absorption lines are characteristic of each element, and its excited state, their appearance in the spectrum indicates the presence of those elem ents, and their state of excitation in the star’s atmosphere, which in turn indicates the temperature of the atmosphere.</p>

		<p>Thus, astronomers encounter three types of spectra:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A continuous spectrum of radiation from the hot surface of the star,</li>
			<li>Dark absorption line spectrum from the atoms and molecules (both ionized and neutral) found in the outer layers, superposed on the continuous spectrum, and</li>
			<li>An emission line spectrum consisting of bright lines from the atoms and molecules (both ionized and neutral) present in tenuous volumes of gas in the extended envelopes of stars or in ionized nebulae.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Certain other features of blackbody radiation also interest astronomers. The wavelength at which the maximum intensity occurs depends inversely upon the surface temperature of the star. That is, hotter the star, shorter is the wavelength at which the intensity maximum occurs. This means hotter stars emit more high-energy radiations than cooler ones. Furthermore, the flux or the total energy emitted per unit area of the surface per unit time summed over all wavelengths is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. The luminosity of a star, which is the total energy emitted by it per unit time is a product of the surface area and the flux. This means that between two stars of the same size, assuming both to be spherical in shape, the one that has double the surface temperature of the other, is 16 times (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) more luminous. Astronomers use a scale called “magnitude” to compare luminosities of different cosmic objects.</p>
		<p>Thus, sitting in a laboratory on Earth and measuring the stellar spectra (like the intensity of the various colors in the continuous spectrum, the wavelengths and shapes of the absorption lines) astronomers can derive a host of information like the star’s temperature, surface gravity, magnetic field strength, chemical composition etc. In short, they can write the complete horoscope of the star!</p>
		<p>One of the m ost dram atic triumphs of stellar spectroscopy during the 19<sup>th</sup> century was the discovery of helium. An emission line at 587.6 nanometers was observed in the solar atmosphere during the eclipse of August 18, 1868. It was obviously coming from an element present in the solar atmosphere. It was noted, however, that no known terrestrial element had this emission line. Hence, the newly discovered element was named “helium” meaning from the Sun. I n fact, this observation was m ade at the Observatory in Madras (now Chennai) established by the East India Company. Helium was discovered on Earth only in 1895. By measuring accurately the wavelengths of the absorption lines and matching them with laboratory spectra astronomers have identified more than 60 elements in the solar environment. From the strengths of these lines they have estimated their percentage abundance.</p>
		<p>There are billions and billions of stars in the universe. Even if all the persons living on earth take to astronomy and spend their entire lifetime investigating stars, they will be able to study only a fraction of them. Hence, what astronomers do is to group the stars into various classes based on some common spectral features. The advantage is that if one prototype in each class is studied, the details may apply to all other stars in the class. One such popular classification scheme, known as the Harvard Classification, groups them to different classes, known as spectral classes designated by alphabets O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Each class is characterized by the appearance and the strength of particular groups of spectral lines. For example, the O class stars exhibit ionized helium lines; ‘A’ class stars show intense hydrogen lines and ‘G’ stars the ionized calcium lines. Since a particular sequence of spectral lines can be observed only for a certain range of temperatures, this classification also groups the stars according to their photospheric temperatures. Accordingly, ‘O’ class stars are the hottest, shining in blue color, while the ‘M’ class stars are the coldest, shining in red. Our Sun is a ‘G’ class star glowing in whiteyellow color exhibiting weak hydrogen lines, but strong calcium and iron lines.</p>
		<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century more than 200,000 stars were thus classified but there was no theory to relate the classes to physical parameters e.g. temperature, pressure, chem ical com position etc. There was much confusion. Many lines in the spectra could not even be attributed to known chemical elements, as they belonged to ions of elements whose laboratory spectra were not well studied. At this juncture, Prof. Meghnad Saha of Kolkata proposed his theory of thermal ionization. At the high temperatures obtained in stellar atmospheres, atoms are ionized partially or fully. However, in an equilibrium situation each such ionization is balanced by its reverse process called recombination. Extending the laws of thermodynamics and the kinetic theory of gases to such a physical situation, Saha developed his ionization equation, which related the abundance of any ionic species to the temperature and density of the gas. Since the strengths of the absorption lines are an indication of the abundance of the species responsible for the lines, measurements of relative strengths of lines in two successive stages of ionization gave directly an estimate of the temperature. Applying his theory, Saha was able to establish a physical temperature scale of the various classes of stars. His theory was able to explain the correct proportion of elements in their various stages of ionization in a stellar atmosphere. It became clear that the various classes of spectra are produced by the stellar gas with the sam e chem ical composition but at different temperature and pressure situations. This gave a big impetus to use stellar spectroscopy as a tool to study stars. Years later writing about the significance of Saha’s work Prof. Vainu Bappu writes, “Saha’s ionization formula revolutionized astrophysics for it enabled an understanding of the physical conditions in the stellar atmosphere. The stars were earlier classified based on a visual inspection of their spectra, the Saha formula provided a solid theoretical basis to this classification by relating the classes to the physical parameters such as the temperature and pressure in the atmospheres of stars, thus turning astrophysics into a quantitative science”.</p>

		<p>Writing about the importance of stellar spectroscopy in 1974 Bappu says, “A hundred years of stellar spectroscopy have indeed widened our horizon in astronom y very significantly. We have today reliable methods of temperature and lum inosity classification, line of sight velocity measurements and the means of evaluating abundances and physical conditions in the atmosphere of most stars within our reach. Indeed, we have minimal information on the spectral characteristics of almost every different kind of object we are aware of today in the heavens. The future will undoubtedly witness not only a manifold degree of comprehension of these objects, but also an increase in the awareness of many hitherto unknown species of the constituents of the universe…..which may play very important roles in our future understanding of stellar evolution and cosmology”.</p>
		<p>Bappu became an authority in m easuring and interpreting spectra of different kinds of stars, hot Wolf-Rayet stars that have emission lines in their spectra in addition to the absorption lines and cool stars, which have prominent emission lines of ionized calcium in their spectra. Studies of the latter class led to what is popularly known as the “Wilson-Bappu Effect”, which became a convenient tool not only for studying certain classes of stars (their chromospheres) but also for determining their distances from Earth.</p>
