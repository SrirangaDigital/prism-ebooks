		<p>Knowing distances between places is an important aspect in our daily life. If some one asks you the distance from your home to school, you will say half kilometer or one kilometer as the case may be. The distance of the state capital from your town may be 200 kilometers. These distances are measured during geographic surveys.</p>
		<p>On the cosmography of the universe, what is the size of the Earth and what are the distances between the Earth and other celestial objects. These are important questions, which aid our understanding of the evolution of the universe. The Moon is 300,000 km from the Earth; the Sun is at 150 million kilometers. In astronomical sense, these are just neighborhoods. The Sun is just one of the billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, the large patch of light stretched across the sky that we can see even with unaided eye. Its size is billion-billion kilometers across! There are millions of such galaxies in the universe. Can you imagine how far the stars in these galaxies are from the Earth? How do astronom ers m easure such distances and handle such numbers?</p>
		<p>In our daily experience the unit of distance is a kilometer (or mile), which obviously is too small for astronomical purposes. A different standard is necessary. The lifeline of astronomy is the light (and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation) emitted by the celestial bodies. Light travels at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second. The distance that light travels in one year is about ten trillion kilometers (1 followed by twelve zeros!). Astronomers use this as a unit, called a ‘the light-year’, as one of the convenient units for expressing distances involved in astronomy. On this scale the Sun, whose light takes about eight minutes to reach the Earth, is only 15 micro light-years away. Even on this scale, the Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light-years across. Astronomers estimate that the most distant objects that we can see are about 10 to 12 billion light-years away. We are receiving today light from these objects emitted 10 to 12 billion years ago, which is almost equal to the age of the universe itself!</p>
		<p>Now let us see how astronom ers m easure these distances. One of the methods used for measuring distances in astronomy is based on the concept of “parallax”. Hold your thumb in front of your eyes. Now look at it with one eye, then with the other. With reference to a more distant background, the position of the thumb appears to shift. This apparent shift is known as Parallax. Hold the thumb slightly farther away, say at arm’s length and repeat the experiment. This time you notice the parallax reduced, which suggests that it is a function of distance to the object. This is the principle that surveyors use to measure distances on Earth, say the width of a river. They select two reference locations on one bank and view an object, say a tree, on the other bank through a telescope. By knowing the distance between the locations and the parallax, the width of the river can be determined.</p>
		<p>In a similar way, astronom ers can determ ine the distances of a given star from the Earth. However, the astronomical distances are so huge that separation between reference locations on the Earth is insufficient.</p>
		<p>Therefore, what astronom ers do is to locate two positions on the Earth’s orbit around the Sun six months apart and photograph the star whose distance is to be measured from these positions. When they examine the two photographs, they will see that the position of the star has shifted with respect to the background of more distant stars. Half of the angle of this shift is known as stellar parallax. Using the distance between the positions on the Earth’s orbit from where the photographs were taken and the stellar parallax, astronomers can determine the distance to the star.</p>
		<p>The system has its limitations. Parallax decreases as the distance to the star increases. Hence, its accurate measurement becomes difficult. Therefore, the method cannot be used to measure distances of far-lying objects. However, in 1990, the European Space Agency launched a satellite by name Hipparcos, which could measure parallax with greater accuracy and extend distance measurements to stars as far away as 1500 light-years.</p>
		<p>For objects lying beyond this, another method known as the spectrophotometric distance method is used. This is based on the inverse-square law of light propagation, according to which the apparent brightness of a star decreases as the square of its distance from the Earth. Hence, by measuring the apparent brightness of a star whose spectral class is known from spectroscopy and comparing it with the intrinsic brightness of a star of the same spectral class, the distance of the former star from the Earth can be calculated. The method requires a proper calibration of the intrinsic brightness or luminosity of stars with their spectral classes. Such a calibration is obtained only through direct trigonometric measurements of the distance of nearby stars using methods like the ‘parallax’ or the ‘moving clusters’. The Wilson-Bappu effect provides a new way of estimating the intrinsic brightness of certain class of stars.</p>
		<p>Along with Olin Chaddock Wilson of Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, Bappu conducted a detailed spectroscopic study of a large number of cool stars of spectral classes G, K and M. All these stars have very pronounced absorption lines of singly ionized calcium at wavelengths 393.3nm and 396.8 nm. These are known as the Ca II K and H lines. One peculiarity of these absorption lines in the above class of stars is that at the center of the absorption appears a hump as if the absorption were reversed to produce an emission line.</p>

		<p>This reversal is indicative of the existence of a dilute hotter layer of gas just above the photosphere of these stars. The layer is known as chromosphere. After a preliminary examination of the spectra of such stars, Bappu found that the width of the emission feature within the main absorption line of ionized calcium, e.g., the Ca II K line, was directly related to the luminosity of the stars. The luminosity is a fundamental parameter that provides a measure of the total amount of radiation coming out of the star. Intrinsically brighter stars seemed to have broader Ca II K emission features. Bappu mentioned this to Wilson before leaving for India. Wilson further examined this aspect and reported it at a conference in 1954. The relationship was found to hold true for a large range of luminosities and appeared to be a fundamental one, independent of the surface temperature of those stars. Though no immediate explanation for the relationship was forthcoming, astronomers were excited about it. Wilson and Bappu examined as many as 185 stars for which the luminosities were known accurately from other methods and established a calibration between the width of the Ca II K emission feature and luminosity. Using the calibrated relationship, one can estimate the luminosity of a star of similar class by measuring the width of its Ca II K emission feature. They publsihed the results in the prestigious journal Astrophysical Journal in 1957. This relationship came to be known as the “Wilson-Bappu Effect”. Once the luminosity is known, it is a simple matter to determine the distance of the star by applying the distance modulus relation. Thus, Wilson-Bappu Effect became a very effective method of determining stellar distances.</p>
		<p>Astronomers recognize three distinct layers in the atmospheres of the Sun and other sun-like stars. The first is the bright photosphere from where we receive the maximum amount of light from the star. Above the photosphere is the chromosphere and beyond that is the corona. The temperature reaches a minimum at the outer boundary of the photosphere and then starts going up and at the transition layer between the chromosphere and the corona it shoots up dramatically to several million degrees. The density and pressure too change drastically across these layers. Each part has its own spectroscopic story to tell. However, it is not possible to observe the chromosphere and the corona with the overwhelming brightness of the photosphere in the background. In the case of the Sun, a total solar eclipse, when the Moon covers the bright photosphere completely, provides a good opportunity to study the chromosphere and the corona. This is not possible in the case of the other stars, which, being so far away, appear only as point sources of light. However, the WilsonBappu effect provides a powerful tool to study the chromospheres of these stars by looking at their Ca II K line profiles.</p>
		<p>Though Bappu returned to India after the initial discovery of the Wilson-Bappu Effect, he continued to explore, along with his colleague Prof. K.R. Sivaraman, some of the more fundamental aspects of the connection between the intensities of the Ca II K line and magnetic field structures. Since the Sun fits the width-luminosity relationship, they made a detailed study of the solar chromosphere which revealed structures that followed the Wilson-Bappu relation. From this, they inferred that other stars that obeyed the same relation also possessed such chromospheric structures, although they cannot be probed directly as in the case of the Sun. Prof. Sivaraman writes, “This study drew such a great attention that our results were the main theme of review talks at the I nternational Astronomical Union (IAU) Colloquium ‘Chromospheres of the Sun And Stars’ held in 1972 at Bloomington, Indiana as well as in one of the lead review talks in Commissions 10 and 12 on the study of the Sun at General Assembly of the IAU held at Sydney in 1973".</p>
		<p>Encouraged by the success of Wilson-Bappu effect and its extension to the study of stellar chromosphere, Wilson launched a massive program called the “H-K Project” at Mount Wilson Observatory in the mid 1960 to study as many stars in the solar neighborhood as possible. During the past decades, the project has grown in stature with technological advances and has been able to study the chromosphere of more than 2000 stars.</p>
		<p>When ultraviolet astronomy came into vogue with the launch of telescopes into space, other spectral lines with similar characteristics became available to astronomers to extend the pioneering studies of Wilson and Bappu. Lines of ionized magnesium, designated as Mg II H and K lines in the ultraviolet region also show the same trend as was discovered in the case of the Ca II K line. Thus, WilsonBappu effect has becom e a fundamental method for measuring stellar luminosities and distances, and to study stellar chromospheres.</p>
		<p>The Astrophysical Journal in which Wilson and Bappu published their results was started by George Ellery Hale and James E Keeler in 1895. The special centennial issue of this journal, published in 1999, featured 53 articles selected from those published over the past one hundred years, which have had the greatest impact on the development of astrophysics and astronomy. The paper by Wilson and Bappu is one of them. The reviewer, Dr. Jeffrey L. Linsky of the university of Colorado writes, “In my opinion the main consequence (of the paper) was the intellectual stimulus it gave to the study of the outer atmospheres of stars where convective and magnetic energy are converted to heat, nonthermal particles, and a broad range of phenomena commonly called stellar activity.” He also points out that the technique outlined in the article provided a ladder to study the stellar chromosphere and led to a series of articles on the subject. However, the explanation of this effect is still not very clear. This shows the complexity of the physical properties of the stellar chromosphere.</p>
