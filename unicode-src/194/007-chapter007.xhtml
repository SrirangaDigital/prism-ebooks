		<p>In the 1950s, astronomy in the west was taking big strides, with bigger telescopes and accessories that are more sensitive. It was no longer necessary to confine astronomical observations to only the visible part of the radiation spectrum emitted by the stars. With improvements in observational techniques, astronomers had begun to cover the entire electromagnetic spectrum- radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays, collecting new and exciting information on the heavenly bodies.</p>
		<p>When Vainu Bappu completed his Carnegie Fellowship, he had already made a name in astronomy. He was offered attractive positions in the west, including USA. He refused all of them. He had a strong sense of patriotism and vision. He knew that India had a great past in astronomy. His desire was to come back home and revive Indian astronomy to its glorious past. What was her past like?</p>

		<h2><em>From Aryabhata to Sawai Jai Singh</em></h2>
		<p>Ancient India had made big advances in astronomical and mathematical studies. There were several top class texts written by Aryabhata and Varahamihira in the fifth and the sixth centuries. As early as 3000 BC Acharya Kapil is credited to have founded a school of thought known as Sankhya in which he propounded that Prakruti (primal matter) and Purush were the source of all energies and cosmic creations. However, it was Aryabhata in the fifth century, who placed astronom y on firmer foundations. His work <strong><em>“Aryabhatiya”</em></strong> is an unparalled text on astronomy and mathem atics. Dr. Bim an Nath of the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore writes, “The book contains 121 verses summarizing the state of Indian mathematics and astronomy up to that time. In this book, the Earth is taken to be spinning on its axis. Aryabhata gave the radius of the planetary orbits in terms of the radius of the Earth/Sun orbit as essentially their periods of revolution around the Sun that is his model was heliocentric.” Thus, Aryabhata asserted that the Earth is round and revolves around the Sun. This was almost a thousand years before the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, to whom modern science credits the heliocentric theory that the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun. Another very interesting thing about Aryabhata is that he rejected the concept that solar and lunar eclipses occur when Rahu and Kethu temporarily swallow the Sun and the Moon. He also correctly predicted that eclipses are caused by the shadows of the Moon on the Sun and that of the Earth on the Moon respectively. However, some other later astronomers did not subscribe to his heliocentric ideas and it did not get the due credit in the history of science.</p>
		<p>Some other significant Indian works were Varahamihira’s <strong><em>“Panchasiddhanta”</em></strong>astronom y and Bhaskaracharya’s (12<sup>th</sup> century) famous treatise <strong><em>“Siddhanta Shiromani”</em></strong> in which he dealt with mathematics, cosmography, and astronomical equipment. in the sixth century, which deals with </p>
		<p>Early Indian astronom ers had contacts with their counterparts in Persia, Arabia, and Greece. Many of the Indian works were translated to those languages and viceversa.</p>

		<p>In the 16<sup>th</sup> century Neelakantha Somayaji (1444-1544), a famous astronomer and mathematician from Kerala wrote a m anual called <strong><em>“Grahapareeksakrama”</em></strong> which contained astronomical observations based on instruments available a that tim e. He also wrote an elaborate commentary on <strong><em>Aryabhatiya</em></strong> which improved Aryabhata’s heliocentric theory and the movements of the planets like Mercury and Venus around the Sun. His planetary system also incorporated elliptic orbits and the Earth’s rotation on its own axis.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, not much astronomical work was done in the next century. Only occasional observations like the transit of Mercury and that the Alpha Centauri was in fact a double star (in the 17<sup>th</sup> century) were reported by European astronomers based in India.</p>
		<p>In the early 18<sup>th</sup> century Sawai Jai Singh II of Amber, Rajasthan showed great interest in astronomy and built huge observatories in five centers- Delhi, Jaipur, Mathura, Ujjain and Varanasi. which cam e to be known as “Jantar Mantar”. They contained enormous instruments of masonry, many of which were invented by Jai Singh. They were used for m easuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars’ location as the Earth orbits around the Sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides. The Jaipur Observatory is the largest and best preserved of these. It has been inscribed on the <strong>World Heritage List</strong> as “an expression of the astronomical skills and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at the end of the Mughal period”. Unfortunately, after Jai Singh, observational astronomy in India declined.</p>

		<p>However, bigger strides in the developm ent of astronomy occurred during the days of British East India Company. For its control over the territory of India, the company required elaborate surveys including measurement of longitude and latitude and chart the southern sky for sea navigation. The first official observatory came up in Chennai (then Madras) in 1792 to serve the Company’s interests as well as “for prom oting the knowledge of astronomy”. It was equipped with two 7.5 cm refractor telescopes. In 1865, a bigger 20 cm refractor telescope was added. Using it, C. Raghunathachari discovered the variable nature of the star R Reticuli in 1867. Perhaps, this is the first m ajor discovery by an Indian astronom er using those telescopes.</p>
		<p>For almost one hundred years, the Madras observatory was engaged in a systematic observation of stars in the Indian sky. During this period, a catalog of 11,000 stars was produced. Observations of the satellites of the planets Jupiter and Saturn were also made. As stated earlier, observations carried out during the solar eclipse of August 13, 1868 visible from Guntur and Masulipatam established the presence of helium in the Sun.</p>
		<p>In 1878, a solar observatory came up in Dehra Dun to study the solar disc, and a solar physics observatory in Kodaikanal in 1899 to study the relationship of the Sun to the Indian monsoon. After this, most of the activities of the Madras observatory were shifted to Kodaikanal. Located in the Palani hills at an elevation of 2343 meters above the mean sea level, Kodaikanal has been one of the earliest of the several m ountain observatories that cam e into operation during the 20th century. It was here that the famous “Evershed Effect” was discovered on January 5, 1909 in which John Evershed, Director of the observatory demonstrated radial motions of gases in sunspots-the dark patches in solar photosphere.</p>
		<p>Rulers of some other states also established observatories. The Nawab of Oudh, Nasiruddin Hyder established one in Lucknow in 1832 and equipped it with the latest instruments. Similarly, Raja of Travancore, Rama Varma who wanted “that his country should partake with the European nations in scientific investigations” created an observatory in 1836 in Travancore. This has contributed significantly to the study of Earth’s magnetic field and influences of solar disturbances on the magnetic field. The Nizamiah Observatory established in 1908 by the Nizam of Hyderabad, where Bappu’s father worked, followed this. It was equipped with a 40-cm lens telescope, the biggest in India at that time and was actively engaged in cataloging more than 800,000 stars in addition to carrying out studies on comets, variable stars, lunar occultation and various types of solar activities.</p>
		<p>On the theoretical side, 20<sup>th</sup> century India had produced great astronomers like Megnad Saha and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. In 1920, Prof. Saha of Kolkata (then Calcutta) proposed his famous theory of thermal ionization, which paved the way for understanding of stellar spectra.</p>
		<p>Prof. Chandrasekhar, born and educated in Tamil Nadu, went to Cambridge, UK for higher studies in astronomy and then migrated to USA. His outstanding contribution to astronomy is known as the famous “Chandrasekhar Limit” which is the maximum mass of a star that can find a stable equilibrium after it exhausts the hydrogen and helium fuel in the core. It is stated that he arrived at these results as early as 1930, while traveling on a ship to UK. Prof. Chandrasekhar was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983. Other noteworthy contributions came from Profs. J.V.Narlikar, D.S.Kotari, R.C.Majumdar, A.C.Banerji and their students.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding such a long history and a strong tradition, astronomy in India at the time of Independence was at low ebb. In the whole country, only two observatories were functioning; one at Kodaikanal and the other at Hyderabad where Bappu’s father worked. The rest had fallen to disuse.</p>
		<p>Indian astronomy was waiting for someone to lead from the front. Bappu was to be the man. But that was not an easy task.</p>
