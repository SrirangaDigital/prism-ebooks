		<p>Vainu Bappu left USA in September 1952 by sea and visited observatories in England, France and Italy before reaching India. He came back home with a mission to build up a base for research in astronomy and astrophysics and put India on the astronomical map once again. He denied himself the personal benefits he could have gained by a continued stay abroad and returned home without even the promise of a job! All he had in possession was optimism, which was infectious; dedication, which was worth emulating; and leadership qualities, which attracted young enthusiasts. He had to put all these to work to realize his grand vision of transforming Indian astronomy. Many years later he would say, “I was returning to a country with facilities which were primitive compared to those in the United States; the largest telescope I could expect to use was a 15 inch refractor.” So, to m eet his immediate requirem ents he brought with him a photomultiplier, som e optics for a spectrometer and some Coude and Cassegrain spectra of stars taken at Mount Wilson and Palomar. However, his main strength was the advice from senior colleagues “on how it is possible to do good work with limited resources if the topic was chosen carefully”.</p>
		<p>Bappu had executed a bond before going to the USA with the Government of Hyderabad that he will serve them for ten years after return. However, the government had no suitable job for him. Therefore, he was offered the post of lecturer in physics at the Osmania University. He refused it. Mr. Akbar Ali, Director of the Nizamiah Observatory where his father worked, came to his rescue. He encouraged Bappu to continue the analyses of the stellar spectra he had taken earlier in the USA. Bappu also got an opportunity to help Mr. Ali in his plans to get a 48-inch telescope for the Nizamiah observatory. Ali used his influence with the government to release Bappu from his bond.</p>
		<p>How much the future looked bleak for him can be gauged by what L.K. Doraiswamy, his boyhood friend, whose career had many parallels to those of Bappu, has to say. They both studied together from seventh standard and there was a healthy competition between them. Doraiswamy went to the University of Wisconsin around the same time Bappu went to Harvard. Both obtained Ph.D at about the same time and both returned home without the promise of a job. Doraiswamy recounts, “In the days following our return to Hyderabad after receiving our Ph.D. from USA, we were reluctant to accept any job and decided to wait for the right one. But that was not easy. The state governm ent that had financed our education in USA demanded that we accept any job offered to us. This drove us to unimaginable depths of frustration. But they were memorable days too. Vainu’s father had built a small cottage inside a huge com pound in one of the best neighborhoods of Hyderabad – Begumpet. It was close to a hill with rocks of different sizes and shapes, some very weird and almost frightening in the gathering darkness of early evening. We would climb to the top of the hill and pour out our frustrations to each other”.</p>
		<p>This went on for almost six months. Then Bappu met Prof. K.S.Krishnan, the well-known physicist (who had worked with Prof. C.V.Raman in discovering the famous Raman Effect). Prof. Krishnan, Director, National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi was very kind to him and arranged a fellowship for Bappu from the Indian National Science Academy, which helped him to carry on.</p>
		<p>The real break came when Bappu joined the Uttar Pradesh State Observatory at Varanasi as the chief astronomer. The then Chief Minister Shri Sampurnanand set up the observatory in April 1954. The observatory had a10inch Cook refractor telescope and its main programs were observations related to comets, asteroids and binary stars. Its honorary director Dr. A.N.Singh, who was the Principal of a government college died three months later. In fact, when Bappu took over the observatory, m any of the equipment were still lying in boxes unopened. His initiative and vision to develop the institution into a m odern observatory found support of Shri Sampurnanand. His first job was to relocate the observatory to a more suitable place.</p>
		<p>Starting from the days of Galileo, four hundred years ago to the mid twentieth century, ground-based observatories with optical telescopes were the workhorse of astronomy. How and where such an observatory should be built? There are certain specific requirements. The purpose of the observatory is to observe distant stars and planets. The light emitted by them is so dim, it is hardly visible to the unaided eye. Streetlights and other illumination in the city scatter light to the sky, making observing distant objects even more difficult. Hence, the first consideration in locating an observatory is the darkness of the sky. Therefore, cities are the worst choice. Countryside, where background illumination is less, is preferred.</p>
		<p>Another aspect in locating an observatory is the scattering and absorption of the starlight by the atmosphere; more the matter in the atmosphere, more the scattering and absorption. Air pollutants like soot and dust particles reduce the starlight reaching the earth. For these reasons, optical telescope-based observatories are preferably located at countryside at high altitudes like hilltops.</p>
		<p>From these considerations, Varanasi was a poor choice for an observatory. The first thing that Vainu Bappu did was to seek an appointment with the chief minister and convince him of the need to shift the observatory to a better location, which many people thought was next to impossible. However, Bappu convinced him with his logical and scientific arguments. After having obtained the Chief Minister’s nod he selected a team of enthusiastic young astronomers to look for a better site.</p>
		<p>A small hill known as Manora Peak, near Nainital at an altitude of 1951 meters was selected. Bappu got to work on it immediately. During the day, he would personally supervise the construction of the observatory and then spend the whole night at the telescope he had temporarily set up in a residential building at the outskirts of Nainital town. He equipped the 10-inch Cook refractor with a photomultiplier and a recorder and thus started the era of the modern technique of photoelectric photometry in India. With this modification, the refractor became a powerful tool that was employed in a variety of observational programs. Besides regular and systematic stellar observations, he along with his colleagues made observations on two bright comets- Comet Arend Rolland and Comet Mrkos.</p>
		<p>In due course he was able to equip the observatory with better and newer equipment and also created a workshop for their repair and maintenance.</p>
		<p>They were the early days of the space race between USA and USSR. Observing and determining the orbit of Earth satellites was an important activity. For this purpose special cameras were set up in many observatories around the world. He also upgraded the observatory by installing a satellite-tracking camera obtained from the Smithsonian Institution, USA.</p>
		<p>Bappu’s acquisitions at Nainital were not confined to just equipment and instruments. He created the most needed m an-power too. He appointed young and enthusiastic graduates, trained them in the techniques of astronomical observations and created a new brand of astronomers. He took them to Sri Lanka to observe the total solar eclipse on June 20, 1955; to Thuthukudi in Tamil Nadu to observe the occultation of Regulus by Venus. Regulus is a star in the constellation Leo and it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Occultation occurs when a planet passes in front of a star as seen from the Earth (similar to an eclipse). Astronomers use this opportunity to study the atmosphere of the occulting planet. While at Nainital he also represented India at the prestigious General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, held at Moscow in 1958.</p>
		<p>Visiting the Nanital Observatory many years later Bappu felt very proud to see the numerous white domes (each with a telescope or an astronomical equipment) dotting the campus. He told his colleague Dr. Ch.V. Sastri, “When I started this observatory I was just 27 years old, and was the only Ph.D. But today there are more than 30 Ph.Ds here and they produce 10 to 20 research papers every year. By the time I retire, it may reach even hundred”.</p>

		<p>The observatory was renamed the Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in 2004 and is equipped with a 40 and 52 inch telescopes. It is now an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.</p>
		<p>Another important event in Bappu’s life occurred at this time. He married Yemuna, daughter of Sarojini and R.K. Sukumaran on November 14, 1956. Yemuna, who has a Masters degree in Political Science became Bappu’s most trusted companion and a soothing influence. Though they were engaged for quite some time, the wedding had to be postposed for some time to allow Yemuna to complete her post-graduate degree. On the appointed day, like most grooms, Bappu was nervous. L.K. Doraiswamy, who was the best man at the wedding writes, “Bappu was nervous beyond words and would wisper to me ‘Dorai, stick close to me - and tell me later how everyone is reacting’”!</p>

		<p>Nainital was Yemuna’s first exposure to the life of a committed astronomer. What was her experience like? She smiled and said, “By 6-30 or 7 in the evening he will finish dinner, take a flask of coffee and some sandwich and say ‘I will see you in the morning’ and go away for observation. He will come back the next morning, sleep up to lunch time. In the beginning, some times I used to pray for a cloudy night so that he would stay home. Gradually I got used to it”.</p>
		<p>A charming, gracious and ever a perfect hostess, Yemuna took great personal interest in the welfare of the members of her husband’s institute. When I met her recently for a chat, her charming personality was very much visible. There is something unusual in spelling her name - ‘e’ instead of ‘a’. When I asked her whether it is printing mistake, she smiled and said, “My father-in-law, an astronomer himself, also knew a lot of numerology and astrology. People used to consult him when a child is born, or the most auspicious time for launching a new venture, and so on. When I was married he told me that an ‘e’ instead of an ‘a’ would be better from numerology point of view, and whether I have any objection to it. Since then I have been signing ‘Yemuna’ ”.</p>
