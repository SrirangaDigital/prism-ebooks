		<p>With the com m issioning of the zeiss telescope, respectable stellar observational facilities were created at Kavalur in India for the first time. But that was not enough. At Palomar Bappu had worked with a 200-inch telescope. He knew what a big telescope could do to the quality of astronom ical research. The m ost important of the recom m endations of the Saha Comm ittee, that of establishing a large stellar telescope so that I ndian astronomers could do frontline research was still to be realized. That recommendation came in very handy to launch his campaign for a big stellar observatory, which could match any other in the world. He took it as a mission of his life.</p>
		<p>But it was not an easy task. Back in those days, in late 1960s, money was hard to come by. Globalization as we know today was unheard of. The difficult foreign exchange situation prohibited the import of expensive equipment. In addition, there were several hurdles to be crossed before putting his dream project into operation. One of them was the administrative set-up in which the two observatories were working.</p>
		<p>Kodaikanal and the newly started Kavalur observatories were under the adm inistrative control of the I ndia Meteorological Department. Bappu wanted to break away from the shackles of a government department, since he had to wait for every financial sanction to come from Delhi. He felt that for a healthy growth of astronomy in India, the need of the hour was an autonomous organization with grant-in-aid where the Director had more freedom and adequate financial powers. He had, in front of his eyes, the examples of the Bhabha Atom ic Research Center, Mumbai and the Indian Space Research Organization.</p>
		<p>At the same time, the activities of the Department of Meteorology had expanded manifold and it was felt that laboratories where pure research was being conducted had to form a separate organization. The government appointed a committee headed by Prof. S.Bhagavantham to examine the question. In 1966-67, the committee submitted its recommendations on similar lines. Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi approved those proposals on the recommendations of her secretary Ashok Parthasarathi, who was trained as a radio astronomer. Accordingly, on April 1, 1971 the Kodaikanal Observatory and the newly formed Kavalur observatory together formed an autonomous organizationthe Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). In fact, on the same day, she approved the creation of two other scientific institutions, the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism in Mumbai and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. All the three observatiories were until then managed under the I ndia Meteorological Departm ent. Such was her commitment to the development of science and technology in the country.</p>
		<p>A governing council was formed to administer the affairs of IIA. Prof. M.G.K.Menon, a well-known scientist and Director, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai was the chairperson of the Council. Bappu had a great regard for Prof. Menon. In later years, he would tell his colleagues that but for Prof. Menon, the Institute would not have been what it was.</p>
		<p>The formation of II A was a major step in the development of astronomy in India. Bappu was appointed as the founder Director. To begin with, the Institute had its headquarters at Kodaikanal with a core of newly recruited, enthusiastic young astronomers. Bappu laid special emphasis on two areas: one, development of strong theoretical groups in various topics of astronomy and two, indigenous construction of a large optical telescope. He introduced in-house com puter facilities to boost stellar research, encouraged seminars and colloquia to encourage exchange of ideas and information, started a training program for young scientists aspiring to become astronomers, and built a huge library.</p>
		<p>Soon in the next couple of years, Bappu, along with his senior colleagues, was seized with the responsibility of interviewing candidates and inducting them into astronomy programs, who in the later years constituted the backbone of the Institute. Like Homi Bhabha, whom he admired very much, Bappu used to scout talent for the institute. Whenever he went abroad, if he spotted young and enthusiastic astronomers, he would invite them to join the Institute and provide them the entire ambience to grow and mature.</p>

		<p>It was felt that Kodaikanal was a bit remote from the major city centers for easy interaction with other industries. To facilitate the fabrication of the 2.34m telescope the headquarters of the Institute, along with the research and training programs were shifted to Bangalore, first at the temporary offices in the premises of Raman Research I nstitute and then in 1975 to its own new cam pus in Koramangala.</p>
		<p>There are two important items essential for scientific research to flourish – facilities and freedom. Bappu strived to provide these in ample measure to his young scientists. To top it all, he had a keen sense of aesthetics. The campus acquired fame for its grace and beauty with fabulous gardens and picturesque landscapes. In all these aspects, he was again inspired by Dr. Homi Bhabha. Prof. Bhattacharya says, “Whenever we visited the Bhabha Atomic Research Center or the Tata I nstitute of Fundam ental Research at Mumbai he used to draw my attention to the finer aspects of the architecture that were due to Bhabha. The exquisite garden and the telescope dom es at Kodaikanal, Kavalur and Bangalore bear mute testimony to his artistic vision.” Later, Vainu Bappu and the institutions he created had m any fruitful scientific and technical associations also with these institutions.</p>
