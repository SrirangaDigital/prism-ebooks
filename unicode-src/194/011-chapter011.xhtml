		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Chasing Solar Eclipses</h1>
		<p>During all these institution-building activities, Bappu did not forget his own research interest in astronomy. After returning to India, he continued studies on Wolf-Rayet stars and the Ca II K line in cooler stars and remained an authority on the subject. His research work covered a vast canvas from our nearest star, the Sun and the solar system with its comets and planetary rings to the physical phenomena that take place in distant stars and galaxies. He also contributed to the development of astrophysical techniques. He had more than 90 scientific publications. And, he loved to chase solar eclipses, wherever they occurred. For it is only during the solar eclipse that man can get a glimpse of the many processes that go on in the Sun that have great influence on life on Earth. Why do astronomers wait for solar eclipses, and what do they look for during those eclipses?</p>
		<p>Astronomers divide the visible Sun into three major zones. The bright disc we see is the photosphere. This is from where all the light, heat, and other radiations emanate. A huge layer, called the corona, surrounds this bright disc. In between the photosphere and the corona is a thin layer known as the chromosphere.</p>
		<p>The events that occur in these zones have profound influence on Earth. Hence, studying the Sun and its environment is of continuous interest for humans. It is possible to study the photosphere by projecting an image of the solar disc using a special type of telescope. That is how the dark sunspots, areas of intense magnetic activity in the Sun and the variation of their number as a function of time have been established. Sunspots are known to have a great influence on Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
		<p>It is amazing to know that the Sun expels more than one million ton of matter per second through solar wind consisting of charged particles (or plasma). During periods of high solar activity, the ejection of matter is so high it is called solar storm. These particles pervade the entire space including the one between Sun and Earth. The interaction of these charged particles with the Earth’s magnetic field leads to phenomena that have profound effect including creating disturbances in the vital communication systems like telephones, radio, TV, GPS navigation systems etc. Hence, predicting solar storms and space weather is of utmost importance to our society.</p>

		<p>The brightness of the photosphere however prohibits the observation of the dimmer chromosphere and the corona. Hence, the best natural setting for observing them is during a total solar eclipse when the Moon comes in between the Sun and Earth, projecting a shadow blocking the entire photosphere. Writing in the journal Science Today, (February 1, 1980) Vainu Bappu says, “With the bright light of the visible disc completely cut off, we can examine the characteristics of the faint distended outer atmosphere of the Sun. The physical processes in these regions are of great interest from the standpoint of the origin, excitation and the extent of solar atmosphere, but also for providing information on the radiation flux responsible for the formation of the Earth’s ionosphere as well as the charged matter that make up the solar wind.” During a total solar eclipse, the chromosphere can be seen as a pink flash with the accompanying emission spectrum.</p>
		<p>However, total solar eclipses are not very common. On an average only about 66 solar eclipses, occur in a century, with the longest of duration no m ore than 451 seconds, and others of much shorter durations. (The one that occurred on July 22, 2009 was considered special because its duration of totality was almost close to the maximum). Many of these can be observed only from areas over the oceans and places with very little human habitation. Only some occur at places where astronomers can reach to make observations. Even with these, success depends upon the weather conditions. A small piece of cloud at that moment can spoil an entire year’s preparation. In spite of these problems, the few that have been observed have yielded a wealth of information on the structure, chemical composition, temperature, etc in these regions. For example, the chromosphere, which extends up to almost 3000 km above the photosphere, is usually more transparent than photosphere with a red hue and its temperature range from 4500 degree Kelvin to 20,000 degree Kelvin. The corona is known to extend to millions of kilometers into space and containing a thin atmosphere of chemical elements in their ionized state. Its temperature is estim ated to be about a million degree Kelvin and contains strong magnetic field. How the corona heats up to such high temperatures is still an unsolved mystery. Much of the solar wind is known to originate from the tall leaps (prominences) of the blazing corona.</p>

		<p>In addition, the total solar eclipse is the best opportunity to confirm one of the predictions of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity that light bends as it passes close to massive objects like the Sun due to its gravitational field. With the bright photosphere blocked, astronomers can easily catch the faint rays from distant stars appearing close to the edge of the Sun and estimate the deviation.</p>
		<p>In fact, astronomers think that an event like the solar eclipse is unique to Earth. Solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon and the Earth align in a line on the same plane, with the Moon in between Sun and Earth. Total solar eclipse occurs because of a remarkable coincidence in nature. The Moon has a diameter 400 times smaller than that of the Sun, but it is 400 times nearer to Earth than the Sun. Therefore, from Earth they appear to be of the same angular size. When all three are in line in the same plane, the Moon is just able to cover the Sun’s bright disc (photosphere) causing a total solar eclipse. Any thing bigger or smaller would not have produced this amazing sight. How coincidental it is, can be realized by the fact that although there are 160 moons orbiting the various planets in the solar system, an eclipse of this nature occurs only with Earth-Moon system and not in any other planet. But, this uniqueness is not going to last forever. Because of tidal drag, the Moon is slowly receding from the Earth at the rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. When it recedes so much that it no longer is able to cover the Sun completely as seen from the Earth, total solar eclipse cannot occur. The only comforting aspect is that it may take as long as 600 million years for this eventuality. Until then, we and our descendants can continue to enjoy the spectacle of total solar eclipseresulting in a dramatic darkening of the daytime sky.</p>
		<p>Though man has been witnessing solar eclipses from the dawn of civilization, their scientific studies began only in 1842. Since then astronomers have not missed a solar eclipse, wherever it could be observed in totality. Some of these have been very rewarding, like the one on August 18, 1868 in which chemical element helium was discovered in the solar chromosphere. Again, in the 1869 eclipse another spectroscopic discovery, a green emission line from the corona was made. Though the origin of this line was not known then, 70 years later astronomers found out that it was caused by highly ionized iron in the coronal environment. This suggested that the coronal temperatures could be as high as two million degree Kelvin.</p>
		<p>Many readers may remember the ‘annular solar eclipse’ of January, 15, 2010 which was observed from several parts of South India. Dr. B.S. Shylaja, Director, Nehru Planetarium, Bangalore writes, “Annular eclipses are different from total eclipses. The angular size of the Moon is just smaller than that of the Sun and just not sufficient to block the Sun completely, which shines like a band outside the dark orb of the moon. This is a simple consequence of the relative distances”. The distance between the Earth, Moon and the Sun are not constant all the tim e. “For exam ple on January 15, the Moon was at 406,125 km (farther than the average distance of 384,000 km) and looks smaller than normal. The Sun was 148,006,650 km, which puts it nearer than the normal. This results in a slightly larger disc of the Sun. The Moon is not able to cover the Sun completely, which makes it an annular eclipse”.</p>

		<p>On December 14, 1955 occurred an annular eclipse of the longest duration, the path of which was through South India and Sri Lanka. That was the first solar eclipse that Vainu Bappu chased and that was the first eclipse expedition of Independent India. After that Bappu led many more expeditions- 1963 Maine, USA; 1970 Miahuatlan, Mexico; and 1980 Jawalagere and Hosur, in Karanataka in order to take photograph of the solar corona and carry out its spectroscopic studies. He him self used to design the telescope, the camera and the spectroscope, have them fabricated in the optical workshop and do all the preliminary tests before taking them on the expedition.</p>
		<p>The tension and hard work on these expeditions are known only to those who take part in them . Prof. Bhattacharya, who accompanied Bappu to the Mexican expedition recalls, “We reached Mexico by flight. Though we had dispatched the instruments two months in advance, the ship carrying them had not arrived. We did not know what to do and got quite restless. Fortunately, it arrived just the day before the eclipse. Sacrificing our sleep we worked the whole night to set up the telescopes and other instruments. In the end the beautiful picture of Sun’s corona that we managed to capture melted away all our tension and we were happy with the results. With that we could make a num ber of new observations on the structure of solar corona”. The spectrographs obtained on that occasion showed emission lines of excited hydrogen and helium that were not seen before. Since the corona is extremely hot, hydrogen and helium atoms are expected to be fully ionized and hence the presence of lines due to these elem ents was not expected. The observations made by Bappu and his team indicated that these lines could arise in cool columns of plasma embedded in the million degree hot corona. This was an important new finding. Since then there have been observations in subsequent eclipses confirming the presence of these emission lines.</p>
