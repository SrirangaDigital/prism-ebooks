		<p>In September 1971, during the third meeting of the Governing Council of the I IA Bappu put up a revised proposal for his dream project, a large telescope for stellar studies. The principal themes advanced by him for the telescope were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Study of the spiral structure of our Milky Way Galaxy (particularly in the southern hemisphere),</li>
			<li>Study of the stellar chromospheres, principally by the method of stellar spectroscopy, and</li>
			<li>Study of the morphological aspects of external galaxies, their chemical com position and its bearing on stellar evolution.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>After a prolonged discussion, the Council accepted the proposal and decided that the telescope would be a national facility available to all astronomers in India.</p>
		<p>Since foreign exchange and cost were still the prime considerations, the only choice was to indigenize the project as much as possible. Bappu prepared a project report for an indigenous venture in which only the mirror blank would be imported. The rest - preparation of the mirror, its mount, movement, control were all to be made in India. After  assessing the technical feasibilities, the size was fixed at 93 inches slightly less than the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson.</p>
		<p>Enquiries were sent for the mirror blank to several glass and ceramic manufacturers around the world. Finally, the offer from Germany for a mirror blank, 93 inch in diameter, at a cost of rupees five lahks was accepted. The blank was received in May 1974 and stored in a temporary hut at Kavalur.</p>
		<p>When we think of a telescope, the picture that comes to our mind is a small tube with a lens on each side. It was so when Galileo first used a telescope four hundred years ago to look at the planets in our solar system. You m ay still find sm all telescopes in science shops, but astronomers are not satisfied with such telescopes any more. They want bigger and more powerful ones to peep far deeper in to space, than what Galileo did. Modern science and technology have transform ed telescopes to huge sophisticated machines, mounted on heavy stable supports, fitted with computer controlled recording equipment.</p>
		<p>Building such a huge telescope is a Herculean task. The mirror has to be installed on heavy yet stable mounts with accurate and smooth movements in two axes to track the heavenly bodies. The temperature of the enclosure has to be precisely controlled, as even a slight variation may lead to unwanted turbulent air circulation resulting in image distortions. Hence, the latest techniques in mechanical fabrication, control systems, hydraulics, electronics, and computer sciences and a host of other specialized branches of science and technology had to be employed in the process. Bappu involved himself in managing the entire technical aspects of the project right from the beginning.</p>
		<p>Tata Consultancy Engineers (TCE) was chosen for designing the mechanical structure of the telescope. TCE had experience in design and fabrication of Ooty Radio telescope and Arvi Steerable Dish. In the beginning of 1975, Bappu accompanied by D.P.Panchal of the TCE toured many large telescope installations in USA and had detailed discussion with the engineers there. On return, Bappu in discussion with his colleagues decided upon the basic features of the telescope like the focus, the mount and its direction, the drive and the computer assisted control systems. Bappu planned the telescope to have three focal configurations: the powerful prim e focus, where the astronom er will ride on a small cage high up in the telescope; a conventional ‘Cassegrain focus’ with a range of modern computer-controlled instrumentation; and a long focus high magnification ‘Coude configuration’ where experiments aiming at extreme high-resolution spectroscopic observations would be possible.</p>
		<p>The glass for the mirror had to be of special quality. It is common experience that glass expands with heat and contracts with cold. Even a small variation in temperature may induce some minute changes in the mirror, which may turn out to be disastrous for stellar observations. Hence, the glass has to be of zero thermal expansion.</p>
		<p>The mirror blank was 2.36 meters in diameter, 50 centimeters thick and weighed four tones! One may wonder why the mirror blank has to be so thick. When the mirror is mounted on the telescope and moved up and down for observation, a thin mirror may flex due to variations in stress at support points. A flexing mirror is no good for a telescope since the image produced is distorted. Hence, to provide mechanical strength to the mirror it has to be quite thick. The thumb rule is one-fifth of the diameter.</p>
		<p>By far the most tedious task in building a huge telescope is the fabrication of the mirror, which consists of grinding and figuring of the mirror blank to produce a large reflecting surface of optical quality. While grinding produces an approximate concave surface, figuring is the process which produces a particular shape on the mirror so that it conforms to the requirements of the design. In this case, it had to be figured to a parabolic shape. The whole job was entrusted to Sri Jayarajan. “My experience was limited to producing only small mirrors, which could be ground, polished and figured by hand. This job was so huge that it could not be done by hand. It required a special machine, about which we had no experience,” recalls Jayarajan. But Bappu had seen Jayarajan’s comm itment during the installation of the 1-meter Carl Zeiss telescope at Kavalur and was confident that he can take up the challenge.</p>
		<p>Using the mechanical fabrication facility at the Institute, Jayarajan constructed a glass-grinding machine that could handle blanks up to 90 cms in diameter. With this, several concave mirrors were successfully figured and used to construct a num ber of optical instrum ents. For further experience in grinding still bigger blanks, Bappu sent Jayarajan to Customs Optics, Tucson, Arizona in USA for three-month training under Don Loom is, an expert in fabricating huge mirrors for telescopes.</p>

		<p>After coming back, Jayarajan designed a machine capable of handling a 2.34 m blank with strict specifications for the range of speeds of operation, vibration, m anoeuvrebility of the tools, m irror support, etc. An engineering firm , Laxm i Vijay Brass and I ron Works, Ahmedabad manufactured it. The mirror blank was loaded and the grinding operations to convert the glass blank to a parabolic surface started on December 19, 1979. It was an elaborate procedure carried out with complex tools. Still it was not sufficient to ensure a perfectly smooth reflecting surface suitable for the telescope. The surface of an ordinary mirror, which appears quite smooth for routine use, is full of ‘hills and valleys’ compared with the optical perfection needed of the surface of a telescope mirror. Astronomers express the limit of surface variation to be not more than one eighth of the wavelength of the light producing the image. To give an idea, the wavelength of yellow light, a component of the stellar spectrum, is about 570 nanometers. Therefore, the optical accuracy required for the smoothness of the surface must be about 70 nanometers (seventy billionth of a meter!) Only special instruments called interferometers can test the contour of a surface for this kind of precision. “Then by using special tools, we wear out one by one the imperfections by precise hand operations in a procedure called ‘figuring’. This comes only by experience and no textbook teaches us. And it had to be done by a single person and not by a team. A 75-foot vertical tower was constructed above the well where the mirror was being figured, for conducting these optical tests to periodically assess the quality of the mirror’s surface, without the necessity of moving it from the grinding table” explained Jayarajan.</p>
		<p>Figuring is an agonizingly slow process. It is often said that in grinding mirrors the first 90 percent of the operation takes only 10 percent of the time, the remaining 10 percent takes 90 percent of the time. “There was so much money and prestige at stake that many were skeptical about our success. But Bappu had complete faith in me and stood by me” recalls Jayarajan.</p>
		<p>After figuring the glass blank to the required optical accuracy, it was given a fine aluminum coating in a special chamber, to work as a mirror. “Though the interferometer contouring was perfect, that was not the final word. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We had to take an image of a star to check the perfection of the mirror. Therefore, the telescope was set up and a trial run was made. To everybody’s astonishment, it was a perfect image” beamed Jayarajan. He was given the prestigious Vasvik Award for Mechanical and Structural Science and Technology in the year 1985.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile the civil construction work, contracted to M/S Subramaniam &amp; Co, had started in 1978. Special care had to be taken to ensure that ground vibrations are not transmitted to the telescope. For this purpose separate foundations for the telescope piers and the tower resting on bedrock were laid. Since the telescope is sensitive to tem perature fluctuations critical areas had to be airconditioned. To provide for the smooth movement of the heavy mirror system an elaborate hydraulic system was necessary.</p>
		<p>A giant 250-ton dome atop the building was to rest on a circular track so that it can rotate smoothly to match the telescope position. This called for special type of structural expertise and the job was entrusted to a company called Vikroli Metal Fabrication, Mumbai. After assembling and testing the rotating part of the dome at Mumbai, it had to be transported to Kavalur for installation. For this, the whole system was dismantled and transported by road in pieces, each weighing more than ten tons and reassembled on site. All those who have built such large telescopes have many such heroic stories to tell. It is said that to deliver the 100-inch mirror for the Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson in USA, nearly 200 men with ropes guided a truck along a tortuous, eight-hour drive atop!</p>
		<p>Walchand Industries Ltd, Walchandnagar near Pune was entrusted with the job of fabricating the telescope mount with extremely stringent specifications. Scientists from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, Thiruvanantapuram provided the required guidance to the Walchand engineers.</p>
		<p>Everything about a telescope of this size has to be very precise for optimal operation. It has to be precisely pointed to the part of the sky to be observed. For this purpose, a com puter-controlled tracking system was designed and fabricated by the Bhabha Atomic research Center, Mumbai.</p>
		<p>Though photographic plates were used earlier in optical astronomy, they are rather inefficient for recording the images of faint stellar objects. The telescope at Kavalur had to be fitted with a more sensitive detector known as a Charge Coupled Device (CCD). Such systems demand powerful computers, not only for recording the images but for also further processing the data. A powerful VAX computer system was obtained through the Com puter Maintenance Corporation. It is amazing that Bappu could rope in so many private and public sector institutions in this national endeavor.</p>

		<p>Bappu’s outstanding contribution to astronomy brought him many laurels. He received the Bhatnagar Award for physics in 1970; Sri Hari Om Ashram Award for physics in 1977, and the Meghand Saha Award in 1977. He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, (1960); a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, (1965). He was the President of the Astronomical Society of India (197374). He was also the Vice-President of the Indian Academy of Sciences 1981-84, Chairman of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy and Vikram Sarabhai Professor at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmadabad. The Government of India honored him with Padmabhushan in 1981.</p>

		<p>Many foreign societies too honored Bappu for his excellent contribution to astronomy. He was a visiting professor at the University of Arizona and Kitt Peak National Observatory, USA; Fellow of the Japan Society for Promotion of Science; Foreign Member of the Royal Society of Sciences, Liege, Belgium; Foreign Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of London; and Vice-President of the International Astronomical Union from 1967 to 1973. More was yet to come!</p>
		<p>Harlow Shapley had once remarked that though India had so many great theoretical astronomers, it had very little observing facilities. It is a matter of great pride that, two decades later an observational astronomer from India had occupied the highest seat in international astronomy. This honor came to Bappu in 1979 when he was elected President of the International Astronomical Union (1979-1982), an honor that made the entire astronomical community in India proud.</p>
		<p>By the year 1980, work on his dream project, the 2.34 meter telescope was approaching the final stages at various workshops in the country. The Kavalur campus was getting ready for its installation. A massive building with a concrete dome was in the final stages of construction. At that time Prof. S. Chandrasekhar, the renowned astrophysicist form Chicago was visiting the Indian Institute of Astrophysics at Bangalore. He was amazed to see the progress in astronomy in the country and exclaimed that it was an example of what one dedicated individual can do in a span of mere two decades.</p>
		<p>Bappu himself noted the progress thus, “The building for the 93 inch is ready to take on the dome. The structural engineers fit up the shell structure of the dome prior to covering by iron sheets. The opticians work on the glass blank that will form the primary mirror of the telescope. And in a year or two Kavalur will have a major facility that will help its astronomers probe further into the Universe”.</p>

		<p>But fate had a different plan. Much before that event, the whole project received a severe setback. Suddenly Bappu, the guiding spirit, was no more. “My greatest regret was Bappu was not there to share the moment of joy. By then he was no more. It was his vision, his planning and his dream,” said Jayarajan. His face appeared as if he was reliving those traumatic moments.</p>
