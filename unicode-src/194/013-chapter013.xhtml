		<p>August 19, 1982. The astronomical world received shocking news. Professor Vainu Bappu, President of the International Astronomical Union, Director of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and Chairman of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy passed away in Munich, West Germany, due to complications following a heart surgery. He was so close to seeing two of his dreams fulfilled- addressing the prestigious International Astronomical Union as its President, and completion of the 2.34 meter telescope at Kavalur for which he had worked so hard. But fate had willed otherwise.</p>
		<p>All was not well with Bappu’s health. Hard work had begun to take its toll. He had a heart condition in 1978 and was in a Nursing Home in Bangalore for about a week. Since then he was very careful and some years later he got an angiography done in Bombay. It was discovered that his arteries were somewhat blocked.</p>
		<p>In 1982 April Bappu was offered a visiting professorship at the European Southern Observatory in Munich. In the meanwhile, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) was to hold its 18<sup>th</sup> General Assembly at the University of Patras in Greece, in August 1982. The IAU, with headquarters in France, is a collection of professional astronomers active in research and education in astronomy. Its main aim is to promote and safeguard astronomy in all aspects through international cooperation. He worked with an untiring devotion for the fulfillment of his presidential duties. Bappu was to present his presidential speech, which he considered as the peak of his career. So he decided to take up the offer and wanted to couple it to the General Assembly of the IAU. His doctor advised him to get a medical opinion on his heart at the University of Munich Hospital which had very great reputation. On examination, the doctors there found the arteries seriously blocked and advised an emergency coronary by-pass surgery. That meant canceling his trip to Patras. Yemuna was with him. Recollecting that moment Dr. Harlan Smith, who was also with him says, “When the urgency of the operation became clear, he adjusted with remarkable speed and calm philosophical acceptance both to missing this peak (addressing the IAU) and the very real risk of the operation”.</p>
		<p>Dr. Smith and his wife spent a day with Vainu Bappu and Yemuna just before the operation and “found him vigorously planning at least three major things for the futurefinishing the Kavalur telescope, getting the 1985 IAU plans (to hold the IAU General Assembly in India) off to a good start, and finally contemplating a course of his life after the mandatory retirement around 1985 as director. In general he was planning to travel to many institutions to renew old friendships and make new ones, and concentrate on science”.</p>
		<p>But, fate had other designs. Two days after the surgery, he suffered a cardiac arrest. Although revived temporarily, his condition worsened day by day, and he breathed his last on the afternoon of August 19, 1982. He was just fiftyfive. His mortal remains were flown back to Bangalore for the last rites. According to his wishes, the ash was immersed in the river Kaveri. He had become an eternal part of the celestial dust, which he probed throughout his career to understand the real meaning of life.</p>
		<p>The entire astronomical world and all those who knew him received the news with profound sorrow and disbelief. Condolence messages poured in from all parts of the globe. Prof. Ramaseshan wrote in the journal Current Science, “In this sad event, the world of astronomical community has lost one of its leading figures and here in India we have lost one of the main architects of modern Indian astronomy”.</p>
		<p>In a condolence message from the General Assembly of IAU which Bappu was to address as president, Prof. A. Blaauw, a past President said, “How immensely would he have enjoyed am ong us these two weeks, seeing the accomplishments of the tasks undertaken, the realization of the plans designed- and above all, how he would have rejoiced the company of so many dear friends from all over the world, engaged with them in scientific discourses in the subject of astronomy that had fascinated him from early childhood”</p>
		<p>Prof. E.K.Kharadze, head of the Russian delegation to the 18<sup>th</sup> General Assembly of the IAU said in a condolence meeting, “Prof. Bappu’s prominent activity in the Union and in the world-wide astronomical community in general, carries the features not only of the skill of an experienced scientist, but also of personal tact, kindness and benevolence to everybody, that has always been so highly appreciated by his colleagues and that has made collaboration with him so pleasant and easy”.</p>
		<p>Prof. M.G.K. Menon, who was associated with the formation of the IIA wrote, “Vainu Bappu was a perfect gentleman, very much more in the tradition of the leisurely 19<sup>th</sup> century gentleman scientists than the aggressive 20<sup>th</sup> century ones. Suave, soft spoken and gracious, he was a man of great personal charm. He had a deep sense of commitment to the society, to his colleagues and particularly to those who depended upon him. His social conservation was matched by his intellectual openness. He had a healthy curiosity about almost everything. He was a great lover of nature and took particular care that setting up the observatory at Kavalur did not disturb the local ecosystem. He was a great teacher and one of the finest lecturers to audiences at all levels.”</p>
		<p>Prof. Menon cited an instance, which highlighted Bappu’s commitment to astronomy. Even though his heart condition was not good, he climbed the 1700 meters high Gurushikar Mountain where scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad were setting up a 1.2meter infrared telescope. When asked why he did so he simply said, “How could I have said no?”</p>

		<p>Vainu Bappu did not live to see his dream project, the 2.34 meter telescope come to life. Dr. J.C.Bhattacharya, who took over as the Director of IIA after Bappu’s untimely passing away writes,” The project which involves complex design and m anufacture in civil works, m echanical engineering, electronics and com puter science as well as in advanced technologies like optics, hydraulics, and cryogenics may rank among the most difficult task in the present day scientific instrumentation. But such was his versatility and extensive knowledge pertaining to all aspects of this complex equipment that Bappu could actively participate and significantly contribute to all discussions. It is a matter of extreme regret that he did not live to see the realization of his dream.”</p>
		<p>The S.N.Bose Medal of the INSA for 1983 was awarded to Bappu posthumously. International Astronomical Union, during its assembly held in New Delhi in 1985 named an asteroid - 2596 after him. This was discovered by the IAU Secretary Dr. Richard West.</p>
		<p>To perpetuate his memory many organizations have instituted medals in his name; Vainu Bappu Memorial Award of the Indian National Science Academy instituted in 1985, to be given every year to an astronomer/astrophysicist of international recognition; Vainu Bappu Memorial Lecture and Vainu Bappu Visiting professorship by the IIA; Vainu Bappu Gold Medal by the Astronomical Society of India in 1986 to be given every two years to honor exceptional contribution to astronomy and astrophysics by young scientists anywhere in the world.</p>
