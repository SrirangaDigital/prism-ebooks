		<p>Though Bappu is no longer with us, every bit of ambience in the institutions he created is a silent reminder of his presence, because he planned everything to the finest detail. Writing about this Prof. Bhattacharyya says, “At Kavalur, the location of various instruments among the greenery was chalked out by him even before the acquirement of the site. He knew the location of every large tree in the campus; the great lover of nature that he was, he could not dream of felling them. Instead, he had only the undergrowth cleared and planned a forest of flowering trees like Gulmohar, Jacaranda and Cassia; the roads that connected the telescope sites were to be lined with rows of Bougainvillea and Poinsettia. Sm all cottages would dot the landscape, bearing nam es of astronomers like Tycho, Kepler, Galileo and Copernicus or the celestial nymphs of the Hindu mythology- Urvasi, Menaka and Rohini. They were placed artistically between snowwhite telescope domes. All these were planned and various sketches were drawn while he was waiting for the clearance of his project from the administration”. Similarly the rose garden in Kodaikanal Observatory campus under his personal care (and of Mrs. Bappu) used to fetch the first prize year after year in the annual competition of the Summer Flower Festival organized by the Kodaikanal Township. In the Koramangala campus the first thing he did after acquiring the land which was quite barren, was to plant a large number of flowering trees and develop a wonderful rose garden.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Yemuna Bappu echoes these sentiments. “He used to make a study of these flowering plants and plant them in such way that we have a spectacle of colors all through the year. But not all that was easy. In the beginning, at Kavalur, the whole place was a jungle with wild animals like elephants, bisons, tigers and snakes. To keep the snakes away my husband was advised to keep peacocks”.</p>
		<p>His love for plants and flowers was legendary. Wherever he went, within the country or outside, he would bring flowering plants special to that place and plant them in Kavalur. In this endeavor he had the active support of Yemuna, who loved flowers with an equal passion. To the visitors to Kavalur he would be as m uch interested in showing all of the nature around- the trees, the flowers, and so on- as he would show the stars in all their glory through the telescopes.</p>
		<p>Dr. Shylaja, one of Bappu’s Ph.D students, now director of the Nehru Planetarium, Bangalore narrates an interesting incident. In her early days at Kavalur, Yemuna asked her, “There is an unwritten rule for everyone who comes here. Do you know that?” Shylaja was taken aback, looked at Bappu and said, “No”.</p>
		<p>“Where do you come from?” Yemuna asked.</p>
		<p>“From Bangalore”</p>
		<p>“Is it from city proper or from a village around?”</p>
		<p>“City proper” was Shylaja’s reply.</p>
		<p>Suddenly there appeared a shade of disappointment on Yemuna’s face. She said, “The unwritten rule here is that every new comer shall bring a plant special to his or her town for planting here”.</p>
		<p>What is the special plant from Bangalore that they may not be already have here? Dr. Shylaja recalls that later she brought a special plant from a place called Keladi, near Shimoga for planting at Kavalur, obeying the unwritten law!</p>
		<p>Bappu had a passion for the queen of flowers - the rose. At that time there was very famous horticulturist by name Kasturirangan who used to grow roses in Bangalore. Bappu will buy rose cuttings from him to plant in the Institute campus. At times as many as 1000 roses would be blooming in the Institute’s garden. Yemuna recalls that sometimes when Kasturirangan did not have enough flowers in his garden, he would bring his foreign visitors to the Institute to show them the variety in Indian roses! And, naturally Bappu was very proud of his rose garden. He had a small garden at his home also. He would patiently sit with his gloves and other tools and do the budding every morning before going to the Institute. When new roses bloom, he would proudly show them to his wife.</p>

		<p>Dr.B.C.Rao, his personal physician wrote in an obituary note published in daily Deccan Herald, “Not many except his close colleagues probably know about his knowledge of roses. He grew them with love and care and had he not made a name as an astronomer, he would have made a name as a rose grower and lover of roses.”</p>
		<p>His most striking quality was the firm belief in human values and the role of academic freedom as the most essential ingredient for the healthy growth of any institution. This was reflected in every action of his in the affairs of the IIA.</p>
		<p>Bappu had inscribed himself in the hearts of all the staff of the Institute irrespective of their ranks. He poured love and affection on every one who worked with him and more so, on his students. Many of his senior colleagues have expressed the opinion that he was very tolerant and some times even blind to many of the drawbacks of his colleagues and students. He used to debate in his mind at great length before showing displeasure with any of them and even this he did with a grace of his own. He largely succeeded in bringing the IIA together with a lofty feeling of togetherness.</p>
		<p>He was particularly affectionate and caring to students. Dr. Shylaja recalls an instance when she worked as a student at Kavalur. Since Kavalur is a stellar observatory, observations are done only during nights. Whenever he was in Kavalur, Bappu used to go around the campus in the night to see that all is well and students faced no problems. Shylaja was making observations with the 20 inch telescope. She also had to expose a photographic plate to capture the image. Timing of exposure of the plate could be done only through oral counting, since a watch could not be seen in the darkness. She had an assistant by name Gangadharan to help her in other jobs as well as counting exposure time. He did not know any language other than Tamil. Whenever Shylaja asked him to start counting he would loudly go on “onnu, rund, …” and so on in Tamil while she could attend to some other work. When he did not have any thing to do, he will simply cover himself with a blanket and sit in the darkness. One night Shylaja went up to make an exposure and called out to Gangadharan to start counting. But to her utter surprise, she heard “one, two, three…” and so on in English and it was definitely not Gangadharan’s voice. Who else was it? It was Bappu! He remained with her during the night’s observation, asked her to direct the telescope to a specific constellation, to tell the angle between the stars and so on to test her expertise. Later they went to the library, reviewed her work and made suggestions for her thesis work.</p>
		<p>This feeling of oneness was not limited to the people in his official circle. “He was a human being first and an astronomer next. He gave a lot of respect to elderly people, extremely kind to people and could never hurt anybody, whoever it may be,” recollected Yemuna. “One day, he took some money, went out and gave it to some one. I asked about it. He said ‘there was someone at the gate with a letter saying that he has been offered a job in a company, but has to go on the first day with the uniform and he has no money for that. He promised to return the money from his first month salary.’ I was aghast and asked him if he would really believe some one who came with a letter like that. His reply was ‘let it be a charity. I could not refuse him’”</p>
		<p>On the day Bappu’s body kept at his hom e “Kadambari” for last respects, while many of his colleagues were placing wreaths on the body, a stranger walked in with his wife and children, placed flowers at Bappu’s feet and prostrated. Afterwards he came to Mrs. Bappu and said, “If he had not given money for my uniform on that day, I would have been without a job. I came some time back to return the money, but I was told he had gone to Germany. I read in the newspaper that ‘sir’ is no more. I am very sorry”. Tears rolled out of his eyes.</p>
		<p>It was not that he had lots of money to give away. He worked for a meager salary compared with what he would have earned elsewhere. But he would say, “I am able to do what I like most. I am building a research center for astronomy, an institution for youngsters to study astronomy. That is my greatest satisfaction”.</p>
		<p>Whenever Bappu spotted talent, he would be excited about it and go all the way to help the person to come up. There are many such examples in his brief career. One of the classic examples is the case of Dr. N. Viswanathan. In the early 1960s Viswanathan was one of the employees at Kodaikanal, with only a B.Sc degree to his credit. But he was very bright and passionate with astronomy. Bappu used to goad him to do M.Sc and Ph.D. In the meanwhile, Viswanathan got married and found it impossible to leave the job and go back to the college. Sympathetic to his position, Bappu wanted to do something about it. His Harvard Professor Bok and his wife were now at Canberra observatory at Australia. Bappu wrote to Prof. Bok about Viswanathan and his keen interest in astronomy. When Bok and his wife were visiting Kodaikanal, Bappu arranged for Viswanathan to interact with Bok so that he could assess Viswanathan. Bok was impressed and arranged for Viswanathan and his wife to go to Canberra where he could work for the doctorate degree. From then on Viswanathan did not look back. He worked at Canberra, USA and other places and rose to become a well known astronomer. Viswanathan passed away in 2001. He kept friendship with the Bappu family till his end.</p>
		<p>Another example is Mr. F. Gabriel. They were the days when the Germans had come to Kavalur to install the Zeiss 40 inch telescope. Gabriel had just joined as a daily wager. His uncle was a very good mechanic at Kodaikanal and father a carpenter. Gabriel had a great interest in everything mechanical. Bappu spotted his talent and sent him for training at Larsen &amp; Toubro. (Bappu personally knew Mr.Toubro, who used to visit Kodaikanal often). On return, he made Gabriel learn German language and put him with the German Technicians installing the 40<sup>"</sup> telescope. Gabriel leant every nut and bolt of the telescope, that in time he became an expert. After the Germans left, it was Gabriel who took the entire responsibility of maintaining the huge telescope. When I visited Kavalur recently, Gabriel, who had just retired was there to show me around the 40<sup>"</sup> telescope and enthusiastically telling the stories of those formative years in his career, with all reverence to Bappu.</p>
		<p>All creative minds have something in common. Homi Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai, C.V.Raman all loved music and nature. Bappu was no exception. He had a great passion for classical music-both Western and Indian. He used to travel all the way to Madras from Kodaikanal to attend the music festival in December each year, along with his parents-in-law, who were also music lovers. While in Bangalore he never missed a M.S. Subbalakshmi concert. Whenever he was doing some serious work, like writing a research paper, instrumental music used to flow out of his room in low volume.</p>
		<p>Bappu had an abiding interest in theatre. He loved particularly the Shakespearean plays. While at Harvard as a student, on the eve of an examination, he saw in the newspaper that a troupe from UK was going to perform the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ at Boston. He and friend Harlan Smith drove to Boston watched the play and came back the next morning to write the examination!</p>
		<p>He was a good cinema buff too. Dr. William Livingston, his colleague at Palom ar narrates that they went to Hollywood to attend an Academy Award ceremony and Bappu enjoyed every bit of it. Balaraj Sahani, the all-time great Satyajit Ray were among his favorite Indian stars and directors.</p>
		<p>Many of us have heard of the legendary Sir M. Visvesvaraya, Divan of the erstwhile Mysore State. He was highly principled and conscious of spending public fund. When he went on official tours to rural areas, it is said that during nights he used to burn two separate candles one while he reviewed his days official work, the other when he wanted to do his personal reading. That was a long time ago. But, one like that lived amongst us until recently. Mrs. Bappu recollects, “Sometimes I used to go to the airport in the official car to bring him home when he returned from official tour. Those days Koramangala, the place where we lived was not sufficiently developed. We had to go quite a long way for shopping even the daily needs. On the way back if I suggested taking a small diversion to buy a loaf of bread for next morning’s breakfast, he will simply look at me, but never instruct the driver to detour”. He was very strict about using the official vehicle for personal work.</p>
		<p>The Bappus had no children. But their house was never an empty nest. Children from the neighborhood used to congregate at ‘Kadambari’ to play, joke, clear their doubts from “Bappu uncle”, and even com plete their school projects! When he was sitting in his study and writing a research paper, he did not want any one to disturb him. But, children were always exempted!</p>
		<p>“When we were in Kodaikanal, there was never enough funds for official guests - Indian or foreign” recalls Yemuna Bappu. “There was only one good hotel nearby, but it was very expensive. The Director’s bungalow, one of a British era, was very huge with several bedrooms and fireplaces. They all used to stay with us. For many years, the Institute guests were my guests! Even now, I consider the Institute as a part of me. And the Institute reciprocates. They enquire about my welfare, invite me to functions, and so on. The Institute was my husband’s baby, and so it is mine too. Bangalore, Kodaikanal, Kavalur… it is all an extended family” she smiles.</p>
		<p>Bappu was interested not only in reviving professional astronomy in India, but also wanted to take it to the people at large. Therefore, he had programs to promote amateur astronomy. Though amateur astronomers are not systematically trained like their professional counterparts and do not have big instruments and resources at their disposal, Bappu believed that “an amateur’s principal role is going to be the spreading of the cult (of astronomy) by his constant effort by keeping the flame of enthusiasm alive. Because, ultimately when we triumph, it is not going to be in the instruments and resources, but in the fact that the human mind is capable of doing what it has done and therefore the biggest resource of everything is the fact that there are human minds to pursue these problems.”</p>
		<p>In an article tracing the history of astronomy in India (including the contributions from amateurs), Bappu mentions that the celebrated physicist C.V.Ram an was also an amateur astronomer. Bappu was keen that youngsters develop an interest in astronomy. He bequeathed his personal six-inch telescope to the Kavalur Observatory to be made available to school children for observing the night sky.</p>
		<p>Bappu had a keen interest in the history of Indian astronomy. He painstakingly collected material from central and state archives with a desire to write a book. A publisher from New York was after him for the book. Since he was extremely busy with the work in the Institute, he postponed writing the book for post-retirement time. Although it also remained unfulfilled, he has left behind a number of articles and lectures delivered on different occasions for posterity.</p>
