		<p>Three years after Vainu Bappu’s passing away, making of the mirror for the 2.34 m eter stellar telescope was successfully completed, packed with extreme care and transported to Kavalur. The way the huge mirror traveled from Bangalore to Kavalur was majestic. It was carefully placed on a huge truck. In front of it was a car and behind it was another. The convoy moved slowly on the national highway, negotiating many detours covering a distance of about 200 kms in eight hours, which otherwise would take only half that time.</p>
		<p>Immediately after that, the team of IIA scientists and engineers who were meticulously trained by Bappu, along with the active participation of various manufacturing and design engineering companies in the country successfully installed the telescope at Kavalur. In this context, Dr. Bhattacharya recalls the enormous help and goodwill exhibited by some US scientists. “Harlan Smith of the University of Texas at Austin, who was a close personal friend of Bappu, not only supplied the complete duplicate set of drawings for the 107 inch McDonald Observatory telescope and several other design details, but also provided constant help and advice during the entire course of fabrication of the telescope.”</p>

		<p>It was dedicated to the nation in January 6, 1986 by the then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi. About this, Prof. Mallik recollects an interesting anecdote in an article in 1997. He writes, “Rajiv Gandhi’s visit to Kavalur was dictated by an astronomical event – the appearance of Comet Halley on its second sojourn to the solar vicinity. The youthful and scientifically aware Prime Minister wanted to have a good look at this celestial wonder and expressed a desire to visit Kavalur. M.G.K. Menon, Chairman of the IIA Council, seized this opportunity to convert the PM’s visit to a gala affair of commemoration. The 234 cm telescope, Bappu’s dream project, was nearly fully ready. The first photograph with it was already taken in November 1985. Therefore it was in the fitness of things that the Prime Minister’s maiden visit was utilized appropriately to have the telescope formally inaugurated. Eyewitness account suggests that the Prime Minister thoroughly enjoyed his visit to Kavalur. He even climbed into the prime focus cage of the large telescope and peered into the dark skies with singular satisfaction. Comet Halley eluded him though. Instead Gandhi saw the more permanent celestial wonders like the Orion Nebula and Jupiter and its moons.”</p>

		<p>On that occasion, the Prime Minister nam ed the telescope and the observatory after its creator, M.K. Vainu Bappu. From then on, they came to be known as Vainu Bappu Telescope and Vainu Bappu Observatory respectively. Acknowledging Bappu’s contributions the Prime Minister said, “Today we hope this example will show the way to many more scientists to come back to India: to scientists who are already India to give the type of lead and direction that Vainu Bappu gave”</p>

		<p>A large stellar telescope as visualized by the Indian astronomers more than 40 years ago finally became a reality, thanks to the unstinted efforts of Vainu Bappu and the band of scientists he nurtured.</p>
		<p>The 2.34 meter mirror has a light gathering capacity of more than 200,000 human eyes, and can see that many times fainter objects. One of the important aspects of the telescope is its resolution, the ability to distinguish two objects, which are separated by a small angular distance. The closer the two objects can be while still allowing the telescope to see them as two distinct objects, the higher the resolution of the telescope. The Kavalur telescope is so powerful that it can image a 25 Paisa coin kept 40 kms away. Deep sky observations are carried out with this telescope using a variety of focal plane instruments. The equatorially mounted horseshoe yoke structure of the telescope is ideally suited for low altitudes and permits easy observations near the north celestial pole. A giant dome, weighing 250 tons atop the building rotates smoothly to match the telescope position during viewing. Inspired by its appearance, Prof. Bhattacharya writes, “Viewed from a distance, the telescope dome covered with super white titanium dioxide paint, with its cat-walk painted red, appears as a gigantic decorated pearl atop the dark green canopy of the sandalwood forest”. This telescope, known to be the largest in Asia, is being operated as a national facility. It attracts scientists from all over the country and some times even from abroad.</p>
		<p>The Kavalur Observatory situated at a longitude of 78 degree 49.6 minutes East and latitude 12 degree 34.6 minutes North is closer to the Earth’s equator and most suitable for covering both northern and southern hemispheres with equal ease. In this aspect, Bappu was prophetic. For, the supernova, which appeared in 1987 (SN 1987A), the first in four centuries to be seen by naked eye, was located in the galaxy Large Magellanic Cloud in the deep southern sky. A supernova is a violent explosion of a massive star at the end of its life liberating an enormous amount of energy. It was located 170,000 light-years from our own Milky Way. That means it occurred 170,000 years ago, but the light arrived on the earth only on February 24, 1987! It was an extremely rare phenomenon, which no astronom er ever liked to m iss. Among the observatories in India, only Kavalur observatory could carry out detailed spectrometric and photometric studies. The expanding gas shell of a supernova, called supernova remnant keeps emitting radiation over a long period. Many of these remnants, though not visible to the naked eye have also been studied at the Vainu Bappu Observatory since 1987. In addition, Kavalur’s longitudinal position is such that it is the only major astronomical facility between Australia and South Africa for observing southern sky.</p>

		<p>Cost of the entire project was about six crore rupees, much less than if the telescope were imported. It is not just the cost alone that matters in such national endeavors. Prof. Bhattacharyya recounts, “Besides, what we would have totally missed is the development of a modern scientific instrument-making ability in the country which has been used in several national projects of scientific research since then”. Furthermore, it created enough confidence in the minds of Indian astronomers to plan building much bigger telescopes.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Reflecting on Bappu’s legacy Prof. J.C. Bhattacharyya says, “He was fully aware of the fact that scientific research cannot progress without utilizing the fruits of technology advancements. Major forward steps in astronomy, he often pointed out, followed the introduction of new ideas in observation and analysis; history is replete with examples where the blind following of out-dated techniques had resulted in the decay of old schools of research. He was very keen on the introduction of new techniques of observation, detection, and analysis. It was mainly through his efforts that the use of on-line computer in the Kavalur telescope and the electronics laboratory in Bangalore brought in a breath of fresh air in astrophysical research in our country.”</p>
		<p>Today, facilities at the observatory include state-ofthe-art equipm ent like cameras for fast photography, photoelectric photometers, spectrum scanners, grating spectrometers, infrared photometers, interferometers and so on. The old system of using photographic plates for recording optical images have been replaced by electronic systems called charge-coupled devices. All these have been put to good use. For exam ple, using the interferom eter astronomers, in 1992-93, have obtained important information of the “midnight temperature maximum” along the equator on the Indian sector and its effect on the plasma dynamics at low wind measurements. Scientists at the VBO were also able to capture the spectacular event in 1994 when Comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with Jupiter.</p>
		<p>Two of the important studies that were carried out in the first decade of the Vainu Bappu Observatory were a photographic survey of the central regions of the SersicPastoriza galaxy and a detailed photographic analysis of some of the southern globular clusters, most prominently the Omega Centauri. Another program was the spectroscopic study of a group of binary stars – the RS Canum Venaticorum variables. These are systems with two stars orbiting each other, where one of the members is active on a scale much larger than the activity of the Sun. The data accumulated has helped astronomers to interpret many of the characteristics of these systems - a study that has received wide international recognition.</p>
		<p>Other works include observations of the hydrogen deficient stars, star clusters, novae, supernovae, galaxies, and so on. Star clusters act as laboratories for studying many astronomical processes including star formations, stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. They also serve as ideal probes to investigate the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Studies of star clusters have been carried out at the prime focus of the Vainu Bappu Telescope.</p>
		<p>The Vainu Bappu Telescope has now completed 25 years of successful operation and continues to be an indispensable facility for research and training and a source of inspiration to scientists.</p>

		<p>The Indian I nstitute of Astrophysics created by him is the cradle of optical astronomy in India, conducting research, both theoretical and observational, in various areas of astronom y, astrophysics and allied subjects. The excellent work carried out by the IIA astronomers in these areas over the past two decades have been docum ented and reviewed in m any scientific publications.</p>
		<p>In January 1987, IIA launched a program known as ‘Project Kalki’ to survey and discover asteroids, comets and the elusive tenth planet of the solar system. On February 1988, its first discovery of an asteroid was made. Asteroids are rocky bodies found between Mars and Jupiter. Since they are the early pieces of the solar system, a study of the asteroids will throw light on the evolution of the solar system. This was also the first discovery of an asteroid from an Indian observatory in the 20 th century. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) named the asteroid 4130 `Ramanujan’ after the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Five more asteroids were discovered between 1988 and 1990 under the same project. Recently two of these have been named, ‘Bhattacharyya’, after the past IIA director J. C. Bhattacharyya, and “Gokumenon”, after Prof. M.G.K.Menon, who was the Chairperson of the IAU Governing Council 1971 - 1994. These join other Indian named asteroids (2596) Vainu Bappu, (2986) Mrunalini, (2987) Sarabhai.</p>

		<p>The solar observatory at Kodaikanal is well known for its studies on the effects of solar wind on ionosphere, a part of the Earth’s upper atm osphere and on the geomagnetic fields that protect the Earth from solar wind.</p>
		<p>Astronomy in IIA is not confined to just the visible light emitted by the stars. As we saw earlier, cosmic objects em it a whole range of radiation from the very long wavelength radio waves to infrared to ultraviolet to very short wavelength X-rays and gam m a rays. All these radiations, being similar in nature to visible light, travel at the same speed, provide information complementary to one another. In collaboration with the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, the IIA established in 1976 a radio observatory at Gauribidanur, near Bangalore.</p>
		<p>A radio telescope, unlike an optical telescope does not see the cosmic object but listens to it. A radio telescope has three major parts - an antenna (in the form of a rod or dish), an amplifier and a recorder. The antenna intercepts the radio waves emanating from the stellar object in a way similar to a radio antenna. The signal is amplified and the intensity pattern is recorded usually under the control of a computer system. In addition to providing information about the star or any other cosmic object at a different wavelength, a radio telescope has other advantages. Because they are long wavelength radiations, cloud cover and atmospheric dust do not attenuate them. Hence, a radio telescope is not affected by weather conditions and even by ambient light.</p>

		<p>The system at Gauribidanur, known as the decameter wave radio telescope, has a ‘T’-shaped array of antennas with a 1.38 km long arm in the east-west direction and another 0.5 km long south arm. The array functions as equivalent of a zoom lens for radio waves of frequency 34.5 megahertz emanating from the Sun and other objects in the sky. The telescope is used to study the age, distance, birth and death of distant cosmic objects. Gauribidanur is also equipped with a radio heliograph, the only instrument of its kind to study the solar corona at a height just above the solar surface, which is difficult to probe using groundbased or space-borne white light coronagraphs. Using these, astronomers have been studying various aspects such as the structure, temperature, velocity of the coronal mass ejections.</p>

		<p>Infrared astronomy is also gaining popularity in recent years. However, Vainu Bappu Observatory is located at a low altitude com pared with m ajor observatories and is not so suitable for infrared astronomy. Hence, the Institute took up the challenging task of setting up a remotely operated optical and infrared telescope on Mount Saraswati, at Hanle in the trans-Him alayan plateau region of Ladakh. At 4500 meters above the mean sea level, this is the highest groundbased telescope in the world. The cloudless skies and low atmospheric water vapor make it one of the most suited for observations in optical and infrared regions as well as in sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. A 2-meter optical infrared telescope, called the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (in memory of the famous Indian born astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar) was installed at Hanle in 2000. It complements the other telescopes in providing wide wavelength coverage of the various celestial phenomena. The harsh weather conditions at Hanle require that bulk of the observations be carried out in a remote mode. Commands from the observer to the telescope and retrieval of data from the telescope are done through satellite links at the Center for Research and Education in Science and Technology at Hosakote near Bangalore.</p>

		<p>As recently as in 2006 the IIA and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai joined hands to set up a high altitude gamma ray array at Hanle. This facility is designed to study gamma rays emitted by quasars, pulsars, supernova remnants, etc.</p>

		<p>IIA is not the only institution to pursue astronomical studies. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai set up a radio astronomy facility at Udhagamandalam (Ooty) in 1970. It consists of 24 parabolic cylinders (30 meters long and 30 meters wide). This telescope has been used for studying distant radio sources, pulsars, and supernova remnants. Prof. G. Swarup set up another new facility, the Giant Meter Wave Radio Telescope near Khodad, about 80 km from Pune. It has been operating since 1995. It is the world’s largest aperture synthesis radio telescope in the wavelength range 250 MHz to 1000MHz. It consists of 30 fully steerable parabolic dishes, each 45 meters diameter. In its simplest form, a radio telescope is a big dish pointing at the sky. The main objective of this system is to search for galaxies and clusters, which are in the early stages of formation. This is done by looking for highly red-shifted lines of neutral hydrogen emanating from these objects. In addition, astronomers search for extraterrestrial intelligence by looking for radio transmission from distant civilizations, if any.</p>
		<p>Gamma rays are the most powerful radiation emitted by distant galaxies. They are emitted in bursts, called gamma ray bursts, during violent events like collision between neutron stars, collapse of massive stars into black holes, supernova explosions, etc. Hence, study of these bursts give information about such violent events in space. Prof. Srinivas Kulakarni, an astronomer at the W.M. Keck Observatory, (California Institute of Technology, USA) who studies gamma ray bursts estimates that the energy released in a burst could be several hundred times more than that released by the Sun in 10 billion years! If such a burst were to be pointed towards the Earth, the gamma radiation intensity would far exceed the m ost intense solar flares and cause devastating effects. The absorption of this radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere could generate nitric oxide that acts as a catalyst to destroy the protective ozone layer. Without the ozone layer, UV radiation from the Sun would kill most of the life on land and near the surface of the ocean.</p>
		<p>Two gamma ray observatories, one at the High Altitude Research Laboratory, Gulmarg (operated and maintained by the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai), and the other at Pachmari (operated by the Tata I nstitute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai) are working for some time now.</p>
		<p>In addition, a number of foreign collaborative programs are also active. A large radio telescope, operating at 151.5 Mega Hertz frequency has been set up on the island of Mauritius in collaboration with the University of Mauritius and the Raman Research Institute. Its goal is to make a radio map of the entire southern sky. The Mauritius site is eminently suited for another important reason. The centre of our galaxy is in Sagittarius, which has a low declination and therefore visible from regions close to the equator, like Mauritius. Once completed, the map will complement a similar map of the northern hemisphere, known as the 6th Cambridge Catalogue.</p>
		<p>Similarly, IIA scientists have been collaborating in the construction of a decimeter radio telescope in Brazil, to observe Sun and various galactic, extra-galactic radio sources at the frequency of 1.6 Giga Hertz. IIA astronomers have contributed to the array configuration, software for data calibration and im age synthesis. They have also contributed to the design and construction of the digital back end receiver for the telescope.</p>
		<p>Astronomers never stop thinking big. As early as 1978, Bappu himself was already thinking of the next big step after the 2.34 meter telescope and had said that India should go for a 6-meter class telescope. After his premature death, the IIA revived the plan for a large telescope in 1989. However, it is yet to take off.</p>
		<p>On the 80<sup>th</sup> birthday of Vainu Bappu on August 10, 2007, addressing a large gathering of staff and students of IIA, Prof. P.Balaram, Director, Indian Institute of Science said, “Vainu Bappu inspired an entire generation of astronomers in the country and provided them with opportunities to pursue their career. …. We still miss him, but his guiding spirit is always with us and on his birth day which we are celebrating as the Founder’s Day, we make fresh pledge to dedicate ourselves to carrying on with the tasks ahead”.</p>
		<p>The staff of the Institute observes Founder’s Day in August each year to rededicate themselves to the vision of Bappu. During the Founder’s Day celebrations in August 2008, the director of the IIA announced plans for developing a 2-meter high-resolution solar spectroscope in collaboration with the I UCAA and Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences in Nainital.</p>
		<p>Today, extremely large telescope with aperture size more than 20 meters, based on a new technology known as ‘segmented mirror technology’ are being considered in USA and Europe. In this, a large number of small mirrors are combined to produce the light collection capacity of a large mirror. Two US led groups and the European Southern Observatory have been independently planning three such large ground-based telescopes. Since such projects are too expensive to be financed by a single organization, multinational participation is being sought. At a workshop recently organized by the IIA, Indian astronomers seriously discussed joining such a project at a level of 10% to 15% participation. Writing about the use of such huge telescopes Dr. Mallik says, “Generically called Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes, these will vastly improve our knowledge of stars, planets and galaxies and address more sharply questions regarding the origin and the formation of planets and other stars, the first objects in the Universe, and the nature and distribution of dark matter and dark energy that dominate the Universe”.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Thus, Indian astronomy appears to have regained its past glory in a short span of sixty years, thanks to Prof. Vainu Bappu. In a fitting tribute, Dr. Bhattacharya writes, “In his fifty years of inspired existence Bappu achieved what will spell out his name in golden letters in the history of astronomy. He discovered new objects, found new relations, built new observatories, planned and fostered new centers of research, new laboratories, and new schools of active scientists. He created the necessary infrastructure and atmosphere for the future scientists of his country to regain the lost glory in the oldest of its sciences”.</p>
		<p>Year 2009 was declared as the ‘Year of Astronomy’ by the UNESCO with a view to increase public awareness about astronomy. To commemorate that event the Republic Day Parade of the year in New Delhi featured a tableau showing the achievements of Indian astronomers. It contained Vainu Bappu Observatory and the Giant Meter-wave Radio telescope located near Pune. The showpiece also exhibited large liquid crystal displays of images of some of the cosmic features- Crab Nebula and the center of the Milky Way galaxy- taken by Indian telescopes.</p>
		<p>Bappu had the uncanny ability to work with what ever equipment available and wherever available - from the huge 200 inch telescope at Palom ar to sim ple spectrographs he himself designed and built- and produce results. But he always thought big. If Bappu came back now, would he be happy at the growth of astronomy in India? Prof. M.G.K.Menon thinks he would. Speaking at a seminar organized by the IIA to celebrate Vainu Bappu’s 75<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary in 2002, Prof. Menon said, “when Bappu returned to India all that was there was only the Nizamiah Observatory at Hyderabad. Then he developed the Nainital Observatory, upgraded the Kodaikanal Observatory and started working on the much bigger Kavalur Observatory. Today we have astronomy in every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum and a range of facilities at Ooty, Gowribidanur, Mount Abu, Gurishikar, Udaipur, Hanle and so on - some groundbased and some even spacebased.”</p>
		<p>Unlike at the time of Bappu, now many universities and institutions in the country provide courses for graduate and post-graduate studies in astronomy and astrophysics. An organization called the I nter-university Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) has been established in Pune in 1988 to coordinate such studies at the university level.</p>

		<p>Vainu Bappu’s legacy lives on, not just in the institutions he created and the equipment he designed and built, but also in the enthusiasm and dedication of those who followed him, many of whom were trained by him. They have made his dream com e true by putting India firmly on the astronomical map of the world.</p>
		<p>Future Indian astronomers may well remember him as the “Father of modern Indian astronomy”.</p>
