		<p>A telescope is a device that aids the eye to view distant objects. Galileo Galilei, the Italian astronomer was the first person to use a telescope to observe the sky. And that turned out to be a defining moment, not only in the development of astronomy but also in the history of human civilization. It had a convex lens of about three inches diameter at one end of a tube. It was known as the “objective”, since it would be pointed towards the object to be viewed. At the other end of the tube was another small convex lens, the “eyepiece” at which one places the eye to view the object. Four hundred years ago, in 1609 when Galileo first turned his newly built telescope to observe the night sky, he was amazed. “The moon surface was found to be a wasteland full of craters. The bright face of the Venus unfolded its beauty of changing phases. The planet Jupiter was seen to be surrounded by satellites. Saturn was seen to be encircled by rings and the hazy nebular patch of the Milky Way revealed the presence of millions and millions of stars”.</p>

		<p>One of the properties of a convex lens is that light passing through it bends towards a line passing through the center of the lens. The light ray striking the edge of the lens bends more than the one striking the central area. Thus, the light from a distant object that enters the telescope comes together to form a small, bright but inverted image of the object. The point where the brightest image forms is known as the “focal point” and its distance from the lens is “focal distance”. The eyepiece placed slightly beyond the focal point enlarges the image for easy view. The biggest advantage of a telescope is that it will make faint objects invisible to the naked eye, visible. In addition, it improves the resolution of the image - the ability to distinguish two closely placed objects. The light bending property of a lens is known as refraction and such telescopes are called refracting telescopes.</p>

		<p>Larger the diameter of the objective lens, greater is the amount of light collected by it and hence brighter is the image. It is, in fact proportional to the square of the diameter of the objective. We can get an idea how far one can peer in to the sky with a telescope of a given aperture size (objective lens). Whenever we look at a star, the iris diaphragm of our eye opens completely. The total amount of light falling on the aperture is focused by the corneal lens on to the retina. That is what makes us see the star bright or dim. When fully open, the diameter of the aperture is about 8 mm. A telescope with a lens of 8 cm diameter has a light collecting capacity of 100 times more than that of the human eye and thus produces an image hundred times brighter. Conversely, with such a telescope, one can see objects 100 times fainter than the limit of the visibility of the unaided eye. With a 100 cm diameter objective, the visibility can increase by about a million times, and so on. That is why astronomers would like to have telescopes with as big an aperture as possible.</p>
		<p>Refracting telescopes have some problems. Light of different wavelengths bend to different extent as they pass through the lens. Shorter wavelengths bend more than the longer wavelengths. Hence, when the object is viewed in white light, which is a composite of different wavelengths, blue light comes to focus closer than the red light. If we focus the eyepiece to blue light, red light goes out of focus and vice verse, producing a blurred image. This problem, known as “chromatic aberration” can be overcome to some extent by using an objective made of a combination of lenses. However, grinding large complex lenses to perfection poses insurmountable problems. The largest refractor telescope is the one with an objective lens of 102 cm diameter at Yerkes Observatory near Chicago. Refractors cannot be made much larger than this, because larger lenses sag under their own weight. Further more, since large lenses have very long focal length, the telescope tube also becomes very unwieldy. But, astronomers’ appetite cannot be satiated with just onemeter objective. They want telescopes with even bigger and bigger objectives!</p>
		<p>There is another way of focusing light. That is by reflection. The ordinary plain mirror we use everyday reflects light. If it is given a concave shape, reflected light from different parts of the mirror can be made to focus to a point forming an image. In fact, it was Isaac Newton who first developed a reflecting telescope to avoid the chromatic aberration of refracting telescopes. Since then it has become the astronomer’s choice.</p>

		<p>In a reflecting telescope, the objective is a concave mirror. The cross-section of the mirror is made parabolic, instead of spherical to improve its focusing properties. It forms the image of the object at a location known as the “prime focus”. Since the prime focus occurs in front of the objective, it is inconvenient to view the image there. In very large reflecting telescopes, a cage for the viewer can be constructed at the prime focus, within the telescope tube itself. Alternatively, a small secondary mirror may be placed at the prime focus to reflect the light to a more convenient location for viewing. In a popular arrangement, the secondary mirror reflects the light back down the telescope tube through a hole in the center of the objective mirror. Viewing instruments can be set up out side the telescope tube at the back. Such an arrangement is called Cassegrain telescope. Another arrangement called the Coude` focus bends the light path and takes it to a separate observing room.</p>
		<p>Over the decades, larger and larger reflecting telescopes have been built. The one on the Mount Wilson in the USA is 2.5 meters in diameter. The other, Hale Telescope at Palomar is of 5.08 meters diameter. The largest reflector telescope, with a mirror diameter of 11 meters is the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at the McDonald Observatory, Texas USA. In comparison, the largest reflecting telescope at the Vainu Bappu Observatory at Kavalur has an aperture diameter of 2.34 meters.</p>

		<p>Casting large mirrors is also beset with problems. Grinding to perfection of large mirrors is extremely difficult. As the size increases, the weight increases, creating problems in accurate mounting. To overcome these problems optical technologists have developed the next generation mirrors known as the ‘segmented mirrors’. In this system, a large primary mirror can be synthesized by combining many, dozens or even hundreds of small mirrors, all perfectly aligned. The multiple mirrors combine the light to produce the equivalent of a large mirror. Using segmented mirrors, more than 25-meter aperture telescopes have been built.</p>
		<p>These are all Earth-based optical telescopes, which examine the celestial bodies in the visible light they emit. After the advent of space technology, astronomers have launched telescopes to space for even better view. The best example of an optical telescope in space is the Hubble Space Telescope, launched into space in 1990. It has been sending spectacular pictures of stars, nebulae, novae, supernovae etc from space, some of them as far as 13 billion light-years!</p>
		<p>But the story of telescopes does not end here. Celestial objects emit not just in the visible light but also all other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. If analysis of just the visible light can bring in so much information, then one can imagine what whole lot of information can be derived about the universe if the entire electromagnetic spectrum is analyzed, since each of these wavelengths has its own story to tell about its heavenly origin. Hence, astronomers have developed radio telescopes, infrared telescopes, ultraviolet telescopes, X-ray telescopes and gamma ray telescopes. While some of these are Earth-based, others are launched into space, like the Chandra X-ray telescope (launched by NASA in honor of the famous astronomer S. Chandrasekhar).</p>
		<p>Unlike in Galileo’s time and even decades later, it is no longer necessary for the astronomer to sit glued to the telescope. Computer aided telescopes can transmit picture and data to researchers sitting thousands of kilometers away.</p>
		<p>Thus, four hundred years after Galileo astronomers have at their disposal a wide variety of telescopes that help them extend their view virtually to the edge of space!</p>
