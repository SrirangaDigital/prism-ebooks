		<p>The element calcium (Ca) occurs in trace quantities in the stellar atmosphere. Each atom of calcium has 20 electrons orbiting the nucleus. In the stellar environment, atoms may loose some of their electrons and become ionized. The number of electrons lost represents the level of ionization. Neutral calcium is referred to as Ca I. If only one electron is lost from calcium it is referred to as singly ionized calcium — Ca II.</p>
		<p>Among the many absorption lines in the extreme violet region of the solar spectrum are the two resonance lines of singly ionized calcium – the Ca II H and K lines at wavelengths of 396.8 and 393.4 nm respectively, which appear as very strong absorption features in the spectrum.</p>
		<p>Since the sensitivity of the human eye falls steeply in this region, these lines can hardly be seen by the naked eye when the solar spectrum is viewed through a spectrograph. Therefore, photographic plates and CCDs are used for recording these spectra. The K line is very broad and deep unlike many other absorption lines in the solar spectrum that are relatively sharp and narrow in width. Over and above this, the K line shows a very complex structure. The broad deep photospheric absorption shows an emission reversal at the center which reverses itself into another absorption feature giving the appearance of two emission humps on either side flanking the central absorption. These central absorption and emission components originate in the chromospheric layers of the Sun.</p>

		<p>Like the solar spectrum, the spectra of many other cool stars also exhibit Ca II K emission reversals at the centers of the photospheric absorption. While studying the spectra of such stars, Wilson and Bappu discovered that the width of the emission lines were proportional to the absolute magnitude (or luminosity) of the star. Encouraged by this finding they extended the study to a larger number of stars of the same class and established a calibration between the width of the Ca II K line (or H line) and the absolute magnitude which came to be known as Wilson-Bappu Effect. Since then astronomers have used this relationship to determine accurately the absolute magnitude of stars which otherwise cannot be known easily.</p>
