	<p>The extraordinary life and talent of Srinivasa Ramanujan is a story worth telling, and although previous books exist on the subject, Sydney Srinivas brings a new and very personal slant to this remarkable journey from poor clerk to Cambridge don and one of the leading mathematicians of all time. Sydney Srinivas conducted his own research, in India and England, to build a picture of Ramanujan’s life, and his fascination with this story is quite evident in his enthusiastic and informative writing. As well as being an entertaining read, the story is a lesson in the rewards and dangers of the combination of a great ability and lack of worldliness. Although Ramanujan’s early demise was a tragedy, he did reach his goals, his work is still influencing mathematics, and will do so for many centuries to come. For the rest of us it is only stories such as this that will give insight into the minds of such great geniuses.</p>
