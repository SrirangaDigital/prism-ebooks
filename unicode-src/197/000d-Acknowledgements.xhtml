		<p>I want to acknowledge the many members of staff at Athma Shakti from the beginning till now who have been with me in my work.</p>
		<p>Also, I need to thank the young persons who were here over the years in Athma Shakthi and who reposed faith in me, in their journey towards mental health.</p>
		<p>Thanks also to the parents of these young people who trusted us and support the work that we are doing here.</p>
		<p>Special thanks, to Tomoyo (Giving Hands) who provided the necessary funds and the motivation for making this book a reality.</p>
		<p>And I am happy to have the opportunity to thank all those persons who in any way made it possible for me to have the time and the desire to bring forth this contribution.</p>
