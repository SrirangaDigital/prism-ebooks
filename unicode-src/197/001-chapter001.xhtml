<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>ny person who starts to write a story, obviously must be clear on their purpose, or aim. And now I am that person, coming to write, coming to tell a story, a lived story that has developed and grown as I have grown and developed within my life over the years here in Athma Shakti. These years have been consecrated to a special aim, an aim that I have carried with me now for many years. Long back I had come to the realization within myself that this story of young people discovering that they could overcome the psychological problems that they had been suffering in their life, was worth telling and should be told. As time went by I decided to write the story, an amazing story, and a shared story, shared with many people. For some time though, I had been hesitating about writing the story, wondering about the value and real worth of presenting the history of the community as this changing group of individuals had been living together, on and off for years. After reflecting and giving thought to this project, I remembered the many persons who have been requesting me to write this story.</p>
<p>The story was happening, being lived in some degree of awareness, since September 1979. The story needs to be told in the tradition of Athma Shakti Vidyalaya, keeping it simple but telling the story, accepting the meaning, establishing the possible benefits for all. I would like all to understand and discern the results of all that took place – the searching for clear and deeper consciousness, then the setting of goals, the disclosing of an ability to accept self, learning to function for self with care for self and others.</p>
<p>The lived story was certainly real, with its high points and low points being recognized, coming forth, reflected upon, opening out as a recital of continuously establishing the community as a community with the members becoming responsible for each other, each and every member of the community experiencing acceptance, respect, trust – with all the members realizing that each person contributes to the shared benefits for all and accepts to be responsible for causing the community to be therapeutic for all.</p>
<p>In this therapeutic approach, there is a living together in a community where interactions and relationships are in some manner scrutinized, studied, in order to help each person experience the changes that are necessary for him or her to make if they are to find and carry away a satisfying meaning for themselves. Also they earn a special place with other persons with whom they live their life, living in the community and enhancing their ability to share their relationships with others after leaving the community.</p>
<p>My friends, truly supportive friends, well wishers and guides believe that a recital of the beginnings, the development, the continuing experience of a successful therapeutic community, in which many young persons have found the ability to experience themselves fully, would be of value to many others. They are interested in the very unique process created in this community where young mentally ill persons, teen-agers and adults, have learned to recognize and accept the unsuspected and blocked off possibilities they have now encountered in the living experience of their lives.</p>
<p>In the process of living and sharing in a community, these mentally ill have found that they could decide and change their inner reality. They could discover the willingness to be open in trusting a guide and so in turn to trust their own ability to understand themselves and the experience they had been unsuccessfully living. They could then use their newly realized freedom to choose and decide on the significant beliefs and positive attitudes that empower a new life, an undreamed of meaningful existence for them. They could realize and experience the power to reach out in unprecedented, purposeful relationships and attachments to other persons.</p>
<p>At the beginning, at a meeting of a few interested social workers, therapists, psychologists, one evening in 1978 in Oakland, California, the decision was agreed upon to open a therapeutic community in Bangalore. This therapeutic community would be a place where each and every activity within the community would be directed towards the well being of each member, which I believe is the Athma Shakti of each member. In other words, within the community persons with disability would learn through dependence and guidance to develop the power of their own spirit, and so together with the support and guidance of like minded mentors overcome the vagaries of mental illness.</p>
<p>Basically Athma Shakti has always been essentially a community with all the social and healing benefits that are present in community living – friendship, responsibility, mutual support, ever-present care and understanding healthy dependency, learning from others, ability to study where possible, facing up to the present problems of living and adjusting to others.</p>
<p>The main focus has always been on forming a relationship with a guide or mentor, and also relationships with others, some quite close, others amiable, familiar and convivial. This has been the most helpful treatment modality – relationships. The community specializes in the holistic psychotherapy treatment of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and others.</p>
<p>One of the obvious traits a person who has mental problems develops is their inability to be at ease with other persons, their tendency to withdraw and be alone. Many of their difficulties come from their early life in the family and early school years. These may not have been resolved, they may have even worsened as they grew and struggled while trying to find the means to function normally. When referring to the cases of some young men and women, families may be questioned concerning the efforts they may have made or not made in understanding the source of the problems the young person has carried with them in their growing years and could not resolve.</p>
<p>The new comer to Athma Shakti is asked to make a contract with the community, making a formal, open request in a community meeting to be accepted as a member of the community after stating a promise to “work to get well” and to “help others to get well”. Once accepted the person will be given the assistance he or she is seeking through the acceptance by the others. This promised assistance will be in the form of friendly support and acceptance, plus confrontations and feedback that will help the person wishing to join the community to become aware of the necessary changes in personality, behaviour and thinking he or she is invited to make, and the directions given so that he or she can function appropriately in the community and later return to family and society.</p>
<p>As we begin to talk about purposes and aims I must speak about myself, for I have much to relate and remember. I hope that in the course of this narration of my involvement in the establishment of Athma Shakti Vidyalaya I can convey how much this has been a tremendous growing experience for me personally. I believe the development of the whole experience was intriguing and soulful. Rather I can almost call it a best experience as I did what I believe God wanted me to do, as I was supported by my religious superiors to deviate from the usual religious avocation and routine. I count the permission I was given as a great blessing given to me. Living my life as the director of our therapeutic community has been an opportunity, a blessing, and an endowment.</p>
<p>The number of relationships that have come into my life have exceeded any gift I could ever have expected in my life. All that I have gained and learned over the years, the richness in relationships with the persons who have come for help or have been sent for rehabilitation I will always be grateful for. And the numerous others who have come for assistance have all been part of an experience that has been unique for me, and which I shall always appreciate.</p>
<p>I find myself thinking that soon after I finish writing this history of Athma Shakti Vidyalaya and my involvement with that history, I would like to write a book on spirituality given the many numerous insights into the spiritual life of the human personality that I have gained over the years.</p>
<p>But now I have to be preoccupied with making the therapeutic process that we follow here capable of leading more young adults, men and women, to be fully conscious of the various feelings, memories, attitudes that they may be experiencing within themselves and the manner in which they handle or cope with those reactions.</p>
<p>My purpose through this present writing comes from my own desire to satisfy the persons who have been insisting that I write about how I engaged myself for the past 30 years in instigating and continuing to develop a process of healing, a healing process that has been continuously developing. I realized that I could be of assistance to young men and women who have been sidetracked and have lost the simple, clear acceptance of themselves. Other persons have been pushing me to write, those who seem to believe that I have been in some manner the instrument that has enabled them as persons to overcome their mental problems.</p>
<p>The story of Athma Shakti really grows out of the story of my own life in the 1970s, and l will have to refer to the various developments in my life over the last fifty years as I tell the story of the developments that brought this therapeutic community into existence.</p>
<p>Over the years I have always been hesitating to write, for my experience has told me that there is usually very little interest among the general public concerning the serious and debilitating problems that the mentally ill have to unravel and free themselves of if they are to live a meaningful life. Many young people have had their families quite shattered because of mental illness, and I believe that a recital of the beginnings, the development, the continuing experience of a successful therapeutic community might be of great benefit for families who would be interested in learning how some other families and some individuals have been able to overcome the disaffection and discontinuity of normal family life by mental illness.</p>
<p>Many young persons have found the ability to experience themselves in a fully reasonable and remarkable life. From its beginnings in 1979, the Athma Shakti community has followed a creative and innovative approach that is holistic with the integration of many mind-body techniques of treatment where emphasis is placed on interactive, experiential group work and individual therapy work.</p>
<p>The daily routine of community living enables the members to form relationships with each other and staff members. Also emphasis is always placed on the mutual bonding process with a therapist, through which the needy patient incorporates new values and beliefs leading to a new acceptance of self and a willingness to take responsibility for self. Through this process of dependency, the patient establishes his or her independence in a healthy manner. The patient experiences his or her need to develop and strengthen, shared relations as he or she learns to appreciate the necessary interactions and dependency that gives them the appreciation of self and the ability to make choices concerning the strength of their personality.</p>
<p>I guess I should go back to the roots of my own wanderlust, for this has been operative throughout my life. I first began to travel in 1951 when at the age of 21 I left my home in Halifax, the main city of Nova Scotia, a province of Canada on the eastern seaboard of Canada. In the old days, when I was a small boy, Halifax with its beautiful protected harbour and fair climate has always been a much sought after recreational spot in the summer months. It has always been considered one of the best harbours in the world. It is the one harbour high up on the Eastern seaboard of America which does not freeze in the winter, a very valuable asset in the days when most commerce and trade still traveled by sea.</p>
<p>During the Second World War (1939-1945) the inner harbour of Halifax could accommodate as many as 300 freight ships or tankers. This was necessary as the ships had to assemble and then cross the ocean to Europe in a closely knit convoy to avoid the German submarines waiting to torpedo them. As a young boy I enjoyed watching all the boats leave the harbour, then had to later see a few crippled freighters limping back into the harbour after being attacked on the high seas. In those days we were quite involved in the Second World War – one 23 year old brother, left home, joined and became an officer in the Army and fought in North Africa, Italy, and then finally just at the end of war was killed in Europe fighting in Belgium. We were upset and disappointed for we learned of his death two days after the war was over while we were celebrating the end of the war.</p>
<p>My other brother was also in the same war, in the Canadian Air Force. He was always fairly safe as he was engaged almost all the war in flying, really ferrying, large airplanes across the Atlantic Ocean to England. These planes, produced by the United States, then were used for high altitude bombing raids on the cities of Germany and occupied Europe. He did not take part in any of the many bombing raids over Germany as he was busy flying over replacements for the airplanes that had been shot down by the enemy. Fortunately he returned safe when the war ended.</p>
<p>So, from hearing of these experiences and this type of travel activity when young, it is no surprise that I did not have any problem leaving home at twenty-one years of age and never returned to stay for more than a few days in my home city. After some uncertainty about the direction of my life, I realized that I had to settle on my choice of a future, for two years after graduating with a general Arts degree, I still had no firm outlook, no clear thinking one way or the other whether to continue my studies or find a job. I was quite content to be involved in sports activities, having done well in rowing and in Canadian football. I had not decided the direction of my life. From time to time I realized I had to settle my choice of a future, and make it firm. I was fairly happy, had friends but was not working towards a future, and had a father insisting I organize my future and become employed.</p>
<p>After some reflection I made my decision firm by joining the religious society of the men who had been my college professors. I have always been happy with the same firmness in my choice, something I have never regretted. I thank myself each day that I made that decision. It meant leaving home and traveling many miles to the center of Canada, to an area where I had never been. The first four years of serious Jesuit training, years of personal development and study, were spent with my own English Canadian group, but the next two years were spent studying philosophy with the French Canadian Jesuit group. After that my world was broken open, for I was chosen to join the French Canadian Jesuits teaching high school boys in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>At that time there were only two government high schools in Ethiopia, one manned by the Canadian Jesuits, the other in the southern part of the country manned by a group of Swedish teachers. For the time being with eight other Canadians I was an employee of the Ethiopian Government involved in education with airfare from Canada, salaries and a large bungalow supplied. Among ourselves we spoke French while we taught in English, with myself teaching the students for the O-level school leaving English exam set by Cambridge University. I managed to have some of the village boys pass those O-level exams, for them a first move ahead. The successful boys moved on from me to the other Canadian Jesuit educational institution in the country – the Haile Selassie University – then the only higher education facility in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Since my contract with the Ethiopian Government was only for three years, I was slated to go back to Canada and be with the Jesuits in their various works there. At first I was to study four years of theology, and in that process become an ordained priest and after another year of special studies be considered a fully fledged Jesuit posted in one of the Jesuit schools in Canada or sent for any further university studies to follow in order to teach in one of the Jesuit schools or colleges in Canada. Yet after the very interesting and almost exotic years in Ethiopia, I felt that being in Canada would probably be too drab and uninteresting. I have always wanted to be engaged in some endeavour that would have colour, openness, be absorbing and relevant in today’s world. Canada, I believed, had usually been considered a staid and quiet country, with its cold and icy winters, its citizens serious and self-restrained, and so not all that interesting (except for its amazing ice hockey games). I was to amass some very rewarding memories in Africa – being stranded on the shore of Somalia when our jeep became stuck in the sand, after a huge unexpected tropical rain storm. Luckily, Somalia was still at that time a colony of England so we had the local police officer’s bungalow to stay in with a diet of camel’s milk and goat meat. After three days we managed to get a spare battery and drive into Dijbouti, then still a French colony.</p>
<p>Besides the adventure of bringing these village boys to the level of writing an English essay, the trips and campings with the school boys, encountering the free wild life from close up gave me a whole swarm of memories that have remained with me.</p>
<p>Ethiopia struck me with the travel bug so well that the prospect of returning to Canada and settling down for the duration did not appear so interesting. I had enjoyed Ethiopia, with its varied landscapes, with its different customs and primitive tribes evolving and coping with the intervening modern civilization. As I was breaking into its complicated but beautiful customs and practices, I had really enjoyed teaching those eager village boys. Their enthusiasm to learn had been exciting to experience. I realize that I stumbled or may be just slipped unawares into the captivating and fascinating study of the human personality.</p>
<p>One rewarding experience I had with them I will always remember well. We had taught the senior boys to play softball – an easier form of baseball which is itself the American national game. We had four teams in a softball league we had formed in Addis-Ababa – our school team, the team of the Jesuit college, the Ethiopian Airlines team, (made up mostly of expat Americans), and a team of American soldiers who were training the Ethiopian Army at that time. Our school team was made up of the schoolboys plus myself. When young in Canada I had played a lot of softball as a catcher. The catcher in softball resembles the wicket-keeper in cricket. Our school team managed to defeat the team of American soldiers.</p>
<p>Because of many small happenings I have always appreciated and in some way felt proud of my three year stay of teaching and supervising students in Ethiopia. We were nine of us Canadian Jesuits administrating the residential school, invited employees of the Ethiopian government. For three years I taught the top English classes, preparing students for the Cambridge O-level English language paper. The two proud achievements I took away with me from teaching those boys was that for the first time some of our students managed to pass the O-level English exam and the Saturday afternoon when our school team - consisting of the boys, who had learned to play softball in the school, plus myself, defeated the team made up of American soldiers.</p>
<p>At the end of my contract of three years I was not very interested in returning and settling down to a quiet life in Canada. I had never expected that I would be sent to be a teacher in Ethiopia and had had a wonderful time even though there had been difficulties. I had never experienced how interesting life can be on the other side of world. I now had come in contact with the less fortunate people in this world and decided that the usual protected life in Canada seemed too orderly, not so creative. So I asked that rather than go back to Canada I could join the English Canadian Jesuits who had been working in India since 1946. My request was accepted but I was called to return to Canada for some time before moving to India. I spent two months in Canada and then was told to accompany an older priest who was returning to India. On arrival in India I was asked to move up to Darjeeling in order to give guidance to the senior students in the Jesuit boys’ school there. These boys from Calcutta and other cities had to spend nine months of the year holed up as residents in a boarding school with the most beautiful view of the Himalayas which after a few years they did not quite appreciate as much. For some of them the life in the more interesting cafes in Calcutta seemed definitely more interesting. The school is a recognized and valued school which has been educating an elite group of students for almost a hundred years on a beautiful corner of the hills near Darjeeling. The school was established – it is the type of school that has always been considered “established”. Originally it was recognized as worthy for the sons of the English tea planters and the civil servants of the British raj. Established in the 1880s it was also open to the vintage royalties of the Himalayas and also accepted students from the neighbouring English colonies as Burma and Ceylon. Many generations of tea planters had gone through their schooling in North India.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia I had lived at nine thousand feet of altitude, for Addis Ababa is situated on the western plateau, that is, one side of the Rift Valley which runs through what is often called the horn of Africa. I thought that coming to Darjeeling at nine thousand feet would be interesting, especially after seeing the photos of the beautiful Himalayan summits that could be seen from Darjeeling.</p>
<p>In the usual run of the system I would be in Canada studying four years to become an ordained minister of the Roman Catholic church. Again I was outspoken and spoke my mind and made a decisive decision in stating that I did not want to remain in Canada for my life. The wanderlust was becoming stronger in me.</p>
<p>My return trip to India was to be by ship - from New York to Naples and then from Naples to Bombay. All of this answered to my desire for adventure and discovery. I was accompanying an older Canadian Jesuit priest, who was returning to St. Joseph’s College School in Darjeeling, where he had been teaching for years already. We left from New York on a luxury liner to cross the ocean for as yet there were no Boeing 707s shifting people all over the world. We went New York to Naples in Italy – visited Rome for a couple of days, then boarded another passenger ship sailing from Naples to Hong Kong. We disembarked at Bombay, and then with our accompanying boxes of luggage and books took the train to Calcutta, and then to Darjeeling. I was slated to help out as a warden in St.Joseph’s College School in Darjeeling until my theology studies and Nepali language studies would begin after a couple of months. After my experiences shepherding village boys in Ethiopia for a short time I was now shepherding more sophisticated boys of northern India in their schooling in Darjeeling.</p>
<p>I spent a year or so attached to the North Point School in Darjeeling, not so much teaching but as caretaking to see to student discipline, engaging the students in athletic and drama activities that were to educate and bring about the roundabout personal development of these young men into becoming worldly wise gentlemen. I believe that that activity had a role in bringing me to move into the psychological field and become involved in the personal development of so many individuals.</p>
<p>A good many of my evenings were spent in counseling students who found the nine month stay in the school frustrating stuck up in the hills away from their regular delights in Calcutta or other cities or places like Burma or Thailand. To maintain a smooth school for the 350 resident students and 100 local boys it was necessary to keep those boys busy and active. The few local boys in the school could look after themselves. And of course you had to have a winner. Your teams had to do better than the teams of the rival schools and, of course, keep the traditions of the past alive and active.</p>
<p>I found that students will appreciate plays and drama very much. I even won the trust of the Reverend Sisters of the girl's school and was able to break the solemn rules and have boys and girls act in dramas together. One of the real pleasures that I had in those years was in the evenings when I was directing the cast of a play, for example, “A Man for All Seasons” or “The Diary of Anne Frank”. Young people can learn so very much going through the intensive effort needed to finally bring a well appreciated, absorbing presentation before the audience.</p>
<p>They also can learn a lot about their own personality, about the choices they are able to follow through and develop if they wish, about the satisfaction of knowing that they are being appreciated. All of this gives them the courage to grow, and enables them to appreciate their value. One of the boys I directed went on to have a long lasting career, up till recently, in Hollywood.</p>

<p>After all I had joined the Jesuit group of religious men in order to finally function as a Catholic priest, so the time came when I had to go through this final training that goes for four or five years. This study I would do in India, in fact, in the very area where I was in the foothills of the Himalayas, in Darjeeling. The Jesuit study house had been established many years before on a hill not far from Darjeeling. Young Jesuits came from all over India to do their final studies at this study house. The studies covered the religious doctrine of the Catholic Church, the history of the Church and the growth of its various beliefs, the study of other religious beliefs, the Christian Scriptures, the life of Christ. The professors, priests themselves, some Belgians and some Indians were learned scholars, men who had dedicated their life to study, teaching and writing. Since they realized that the men they prepared for the priestly work might be so busy in the remote villages and plains of India they might never study again, it was necessary to make sure they absorbed the religious doctrine and knowledge offered to them.</p>
<p>This meant that I would stay attached to that study house from 1963 to 1967 and later spend some time teaching in a school in Kurseong, India and then in a Hindi medium school in the plains area in the terai in North Bengal. Then I was called to take charge of the students at St. Joseph’s School, in Darjeeling. I joined in 1968 as the director of all the boarding, discipline and games and all the extra circular activities of the students, later becoming Headmaster in 1972.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my stay in the school during those years. It was fortunate to have the government Himalayan Mountaineering Institute just across the road from the school. I had the Sherpa instructors train the boys in mountain work, rock climbing, trekking, etc. I developed a great respect for the Sherpas who could put the students through very tough five or six days of trekking up to ten – twelve thousand feet, then down to four thousand – always carrying their food and equipment. The boys learned rock climbing from Tenzing Norgay, who told me he had been with three unsuccessful attempts to reach the summit of Everest until he and Edmund Hilary were successful. I stayed with the boys at the Mountaineering Institute for 25 days during the monsoon season. The course had to be in that season since the Sherpa guides were free only then. The course just had to be fitted in for it was as a training course very much worth it. I found that it could give the boys many opportunities to increase their own belief in themselves. Years later when by chance I came in contact with any of the boys, now successful business men, they would always mention the challenge of the adventure course and how thankful they were for the mountaineering course. What the students went through on the course, the slogging up through the hills in the rainy season, I have always been proud to say, I went through with them a number of times.</p>
<p>In 1977 I was relieved from my position in the school and given an opportunity to return to Canada. I myself needed a change. I had the choice to discuss what further program I would want to set for myself. I decided that I was not too happy to join the faculty of another Jesuit school in India and asked to take a break by going back to Canada. My intention was to spend some time with two Jesuit friends with whom I had started my Jesuit career. These men had spent some years deeply studying our Jesuit spirituality and had been able to establish a special Jesuit study centre just outside Toronto. These men were friends from my beginning days as a Jesuit so I asked to spend some time with them in more study in the foundations of our Jesuit spirituality. And so I spent some months studying with them. I also took up the work of directing other religious men and women in our Jesuit spirituality. My Jesuit friends asked me to remain with them at their centre at Guelph, just north of Toronto.</p>
<p>As I was settling back into Canada, I was missing the sights and the life of India, and was educating myself to remain in Canada. I became accustomed to the Canadian weather I had left many years before. I was busy enough, directing religious priests and sisters who would come for counseling or spiritual direction to the Jesuit centre in Guelph. I was involved in giving courses for priests and sisters who wanted to be spiritual directors and guides for young men and women. Some of these men were involved in taking care of street people and others less fortunate.</p>
<p>This was in 1976-77 when I was in our Guelph center but commuting from time to time to the counseling and retreat center in Toronto where also I had a room. In fact, the story of Athma Shakti really began at this time for I was reading all the psychology books and human personal growth books I could find. It was some time in July or August 1978 that some worried parents talked with me and asked if I could establish a counseling centre in Bangalore for the treatment of young adults who were suffering from personal adjustment problems, drug problems and even serious emotional mental problems such as schizophrenia, etc. These parents had found out that I had been in contact with Jacqui Lee Schiff, an American social worker and guide who had been visiting India at a few years before.</p>
<p>Now I have to move back in my story to relate the story of how Jacqui Lee Schiff and myself became friends and finally launched out as we did in the move to bring help to young schizophrenics and other mentally disordered young adults. The story – and it is quite a story - and is an ongoing story – for it continues on today. When I was Headmaster of St. Joseph’s School in Darjeeling I felt that I needed more training for myself in the fundamentals of non-directive counseling. In fact I realized that all the teachers in the school should undergo some sort of training in counseling if we were to prepare the students to be able to accept their present lives in the school and to be ready to face the future that they would all have to face after leaving the school.</p>
<p>Most of the students entered the school in class one. Their school year began in February in the near freezing cold of Darjeeling, ending in the middle of November. Only then would the students return to their homes. Oh, you could have beautiful days in Darjeeling – amazing views of the glorious mountains – but you also have to remember the rain and cold winds. Yes, there were lots of games, dramas, and outings but students would meet parents or family maybe once in the nine months. North Point School, as St. Joseph’s was called because of its position on the north point side of the hill looking at the mountain range in the distance, kept its students almost nine months of the year for ten or twelve years.</p>
<p>It is amazing how well the students over the years learned to cope with their situation. Really they did wonderfully well. They managed to become accustomed to the routine. Their young spirits enabled them to make some surprising things happen – terrific football games, entertaining plays, playing jokes on each other. Earlier on the Jesuits had invented the best formula that could be used to manage a group 375 young boys in a situation where they had to live in large dormitories of about a hundred boys each, study together in large study halls, eat in large dining halls, throughout nine months of the year, all supervised so that there would not be any serious discipline problems. There was a remarkable, simple formula that enabled the whole school to go on smoothly. Each boy was allotted to one of four groups, (or “houses” as they are called) and he stayed allotted to that house or group all year long. The engine for this caretaking process was competition for each person could win or lose points for his “house” and there were privileges and outings to be won.</p>
<p>So, as Headmaster of the school, especially of a large boarding school, I had long wanted all the members of the staff to learn the basic fundamentals of counseling and some basic psychology. Because I had felt I needed training myself, especially in the fundamentals of non-directive counseling I had contacted Carlos and Saroj Welch, who with Dr. Prashantem and his wife had created the Christian Counselling Centre attached to the Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamilnadu. I invited Carlos and Saroj Welch to spend a month in the school in 1973 and again in 1975. I allowed Carlos and Saroj free movement in and out of classes and they enjoyed being in the school. The students benefited from their presence. And I made the offer to sponsor any of the staff if they wished to go to Vellore and take the full course of training if they wished.</p>
<p>I had found that the training was very good and had been of great help to the teachers. The students also benefited from the counseling for they had the usual problems of teenagers, with a few angry just because they had to be at school away from home.</p>
<p>When at St. Joseph’s looking after the students I realized more and more the importance of the attitudes and feelings that influence and affect individuals’ lives, and so in a way I was unconsciously moving slowly to Athma Shakti Vidyalaya.</p>
<p>Then some happenings occurred with which I had nothing to do and did not expect. It all happened between two Jesuit friends of mine who happened to have a chance meeting in Bangalore. Fr. Ronnie Prabhu who, at that time was taking over the administration of Ashirvad in the centre of Bangalore, happened to meet another Jesuit, this time an Australian, Fr. Paddy Meagher, who was a professor of Catholic Scripture at the Jesuit centre in Delhi. Together they were discussing the future of the Ashirvad centre in Bangalore. Ronnie told Paddy that he was searching for a Jesuit who would be able to direct and to teach others to be able to direct others in the Jesuit eight-day and 30-day spiritual exercises at Ashirvad and also to train counselors. I do not know whether Paddy thought for some time, or immediately answered. What he did do was to answer Ronnie that there was this Canadian friend whom he had studied with many years before in the Jesuit study house in the Himalayas. He said this man had returned to Canada and was at a Jesuit centre near Toronto at present teaching other Jesuits and religious people the methodology of developing a spiritual life based on the Spiritual Exercises, the book that was aiding many, many religious people to develop and find a meaningful spiritual direction in their lives. So, Paddy finished by telling Ronnie to call Hank and see if he would be able to come to Ashirvad, which Ronnie did and so I found myself making arrangements to settle down in Bangalore, which I have never regretted.</p>
<p>That was in 1978. I was to come to Bangalore to give religious men and women training so they could develop and enrich their own spirituality and in turn bring help and assistance to impart this same knowledge to other interested persons who wished to develop and enrich their spirituality. This training in spirituality was to be based on the tradition of the Jesuit spirituality. Ignatius was a nobleman, a leader in one of the small petty kingdoms in Spain in the 1500’s. They were fighting the Mores, the Moslems, who were busy moving to take over Catholic Spain. Ignatius’ family controlled one small feudal province or kingdom. One day in battling against great odds one of Ignatius’s legs was badly damaged just below the knee. He was taken home to their small castle where he was treated with whatever was possible at that time. So, Ignatius had to remain in bed for many months. He became very upset because the damage to his leg had resulted in a projection on the injured knee bone protruding out quite unseemly through his silk stocking. In those times a knight wore knee length silk stockings. Ignatius was very upset with the condition and so had had the bone broken again so the problem would not be so noticeable. He went through months of agony in order to satisfy his vanity. Such was the vanity of the man who would one day go on pilgrimage in sackcloth and ashes, and leave his sword as a thrown away souvenir decorating the church inner wall.</p>
<p>Before, when the wounded Ignatius was lying in bed helpless, he had his family bring reading material. There were three books in the house – one of romantic short stories, the others being stories of the lives of the saints. He began to spend time reading and reflecting. And he went through an exercise such that could be recorded for a psychology textbook on the study of feelings when making a decision. In the process of his reading, Ignatius used to break off and then remain thinking for some time. This happened over a period of weeks. Ignatius began to keep track of the feelings he was having as he took time quietly reflecting after the readings. He began to become aware that when he rested from reading the book of romantic stories he would often feel restless and ill at ease, but when he lay down the books of the saints he felt at peace and could go on for sometime feeling at ease and comforted. Also as he reflected, he began to day dream and to have the idea of becoming active again and then doing some remarkable adventures with other holy men for Christ.</p>
<p>He realized that he felt quite happy and fulfilled when he dreamed of doing these great adventures for Christ. As he began to reflect quietly for longer periods gradually he came to the idea that, when well enough, he would set out to do some great exploits for Christ.</p>
<p>He became well enough to leave his bed and move out. So, he decided he would go on a pilgrimage, a holy trip in faith to some of the churches or chapels away from his castle. This he planned out very minutely and one evening did set out from his home. He went on pilgrimage and then stopped at a church that was considered a holy shrine, hung up his sword on the wall behind Our Lady’s statue, and spent the whole night praying and offering himself to God forever. And so he made the move of his life. He never returned home, going off as a mendicant beggar in prayer. What was his intention? To break with the past, to free himself as for a new life, quietly declaring that he would follow whatever God, his new Lord and chosen Leader might make known for him to go.</p>
<p>He settled down in a cave close to a very old shrine, quietly meditating, fasting, noticing and tracking very carefully his interior thoughts and feelings – searching clarity and acceptance within himself as he became an expert in considering his inner thoughts and feelings. Really he was searching from the reactions in his mind and feelings, what he should do with himself in order to fulfill God’s plan for him in his life. He had long realized that the political problems of his country and in other countries of Europe could not be solved by battles. Peace and prosperity could only come from persons changing their attitudes, their feelings, their hearts and coming to agreements and mutual acceptance.</p>
<p>For Ignatius it meant going back – as a grown man – to primary school, to learn the languages necessary, to learn to study philosophy, law, geography. And as a group of young men began to assemble around him at the University of Paris, he began to imagine a future group of men dedicated to the harmonious welfare, education and health of all, in a world where people would be consciously striving to find within their lives the will of God and to live according to that will as much as possible. People often came to him, listened to him, amazed at his quiet spiritual strength and learning, although he had never studied any scriptures or doctrine. His followers, he planned, would be fully educated in order to bring harmonious welfare to others, especially to the poor. He realized the need of learning and study in order to counteract the various ambiguous and false philosophies being taught in the universities and colleges of his time. That handful of men, most of whom he met when he joined the universities, became his friends and close followers. That group became the Society of Jesus, the group of Jesuits today, through out the whole world involved in the betterment of all.</p>
<p>Now we have to go back to my good friends Ronnie and Paddy discussing my coming back to India, and being stationed at Ashirvad, involved in counseling the young persons who come there for counseling and directing the Christian men and women religious persons who would be coming to Ashirvad for spiritual direction and training sessions in Christian mental prayer. The training sessions would be of a week or two weeks with special inputs on guidance in this field of spiritual development. Also, Ashirvad, being quite close to Brigade Road and other popular areas of Bangalore that were being caught in the menace of recreational drugs made us all realize that we had to do something. At least the parents and families were asking us to do whatever could be done to support the disturbed young men who had fallen into the hands of the drug dealers of Brigade road, just around the corner from Ashirvad. In the situation, many parents were quite lost and searching for guidance and support. After eight years of guiding residential students from Class One to Senior Cambridge level, I had lots of experience handling upsets and the difficult, unresponsive tendencies.</p>
<p>Since, I was moving into more counseling for people at Ashirvad in Bangalore, I decided to take a year’s course in psychological counseling in Vellore with Carlos and Saroj Welch at the Christian Counselling Centre attached to the hospital there. There were four of us who signed up for this course, one was one of the teachers who had been working with me in Darjeeling, another was an older religious sister who had spent her life as a medical doctor, and a young man who was a social worker. So, during 1978 I commuted quite regularly between Bangalore and Vellore to follow the course. The lectures during the course were very helpful and with only four of us on the course we had many patients to speak with in the large hospital. It was a very good learning experience.</p>
<p>While I was at Vellore at that time Jacqui Lee Schiff came to spend a few weeks with the Welchs. The Welchs had been under training with Jacqui in California and were still receiving supervision from Jacqui at the time when I visited. They were starting a therapy session with a young man who was having serious mental problems. He was placed in the hostel where I was staying and I was asked to supervise his behavior and personal activities. Also since a fourth bridge player was needed in the house I ended up being Jacqui’s partner in all the bridge games.</p>
<p>Little did I realize at that time that those bridge games would bring about a change that would break open or redirect the course of my future. There were small developments that I seemed to have no control over but which persuaded me to put a new direction in my life.</p>
<p>A year later I was busy in Bangalore giving lectures and spiritual guidance to our groups in Ashirvad. This quiet time was not to last very long for me. The Welchs, from whom I had learned so much years ago in Vellore, were now settled in Delhi, and one evening Saroj Welch made a more or less frantic phone call to me. I was occupied in Ashirvad giving lectures to a group. It was because of these commitments in Bangalore that I had given no thought of attending the annual Transactional Analysis Conference being held at that week in Delhi, although I had been asked to attend. Saroj told me that the conference was finishing that evening and Saroj was requesting me insistently and urgently to fly immediately to Delhi in order to meet with Jacqui Schiff who had come to Delhi for the conference. Since, I knew Jacqui from the days in Vellore, it was not always possible to verify just what Jacqui might really want I agreed to fly up to Delhi and be present that evening at the reception at the end of their conference.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the post conference party Saroj led me to a quiet corner where Jacqui and I could talk undisturbed. Jacqui immediately launched out with her proposal, or rather her problem, which I was supposed to solve, something I ended up doing quite often in Bangalore. It turned out that Jacqui was having some serious problems at her center in California and would have to give up her work there. The alternative she was presenting was to bring a group of young men and women from the center in California and establish a treatment center for young adults with serious mental problems in India. It appeared that theorists in the United States disagreed with some of Jacqui’s procedures in her treatment of the young men and women who had joined her community for treatment. There had also been an accident in her community that was being investigated and it was quite doubtful that Jacqui could continue practicing psychotherapy in her style as she was doing at that time.</p>
<p>And so the question was whether I was willing to help Jacqui out by inviting her to come and continue her work in India. I have always been on the positive side, ready and willing if I believe there is merit in the request and that many persons may benefit as a result of my decision. So, we discussed the questions, the pros and cons. This turned out to be not Jacqui’s request alone, but a request from some people who knew of Jacqui and had attended her talks. Others had heard of her and wanted her to settle in India so that young people with severe mental problems could benefit from her presence.</p>
<p>As I listened I realized that this was really worth taking up, for many people could have the benefit of her experience. I realized that it would demand much from me, knowing myself as someone usually taking up what is new or animating, I decided that this was really the way to go. Still, as it was really happening, this agreement, this willingness to go ahead, would add a whole new dimension to my life, moving into something that would take time and mean a serious commitment on my part. I had already met young people with Jacqui, who had been through Jacqui’s treatment center, especially two young men who had had their share of serious problems and were now excellent psychotherapists, very aware, thoughtful and cautious in their advice. So, I agreed to help Jacqui continue her work, but here in India. I would in some manner god-father her project so she could get started, little realizing that I would be still involved until today.</p>
<p>I agreed to tentatively go ahead, came back to Bangalore and thought of all the possibilities and requirements and problems that were sprouting in front of me, as happened from that time on. This turned out not to be Jacqui’s request alone, but a request from many people who knew Jacqui and had attended her talks and wanted her to settle in India so young people could have the benefit of her experience. I knew that it would demand much from me. My intuition remained that this was really the way to go ahead, that it would add a whole new addition to my life, in something that would take time and mean a serious commitment on my part.</p>
<p>I had made my commitment to serve God in my life by joining the Society of Jesus in Guelph, Canada in August 1951, a lifelong commitment to God by joining with a Catholic religious group of men who took solemn promises which meant a following of Jesus Christ by dedicating one’s life to the cause of bettering the lives of others who were less fortunate in life. So, I was agreeing to take responsibility for a deeper, further aspect of that “bettering the lives of those less fortunate”. I realized that my life would become much more demanding, much more interesting. I knew and was aware that I was committed to learn very much more concerning all the intricacies of mental illness. In my life I had met former students who had to leave their studies because of mental problems. I could be of assistance to many wonderful companions who were willing to dedicate their lives for the health of others.</p>
<p>It might be interesting here to mention one of the values of my personal philosophy has always been a sort of “go with it” attitude – “take the chance”, “take the opportunity”, “situations work out”, “trust in the future” , “give it a try”. So, I believed that there was a strong “go with it” flavour as I agreed to help set up something in India, in Bangalore.</p>
<p>I had gone with it when I left my home city on the eastern seacoast of Canada and went to join the Jesuits in the central Provinces of Canada far away from home, and stayed there for four years. I was then sent down for two years to Montreal, in those days the strong French part of Canada where my studies in philosophy were a mix from Latin, Greek, French and finally English. Then I had a much more surprising move. At the end the study year when I studied the notice board for my assignment for the coming three years it was difficult to find my name. I discovered my name on the far side of the notice board for those leaving Canada and going abroad. I learned that I was being sent to be a teacher in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Often people ask me how did the wanderlust creep into my personality? It is not that I like to run away, rather it is my desire to experience the new, the different. Since that first assignment abroad I have always enjoyed being wherever I finally find myself, especially in the heights or hilly areas. The school in Addis-Ababa, at 9000 feet was just fine for me. It was just along the road from the Emperor’s huge palace and the eight or so big lions he had caged in the traffic roundabout in front of his palace. Every so often one of the Emperor’s personal bodyguards would show up on our football field with a lion on a leash – but he did have a pistol in his back pocket. Next to the school were the barracks, garages and workshops of the Imperial Bodyguard. In those days Emperor Haile Selassie was engaged in bringing the various tribal groups in the whole country of Ethiopia to recognize his supremacy.</p>
<p>The American pilot who landed us in Addis Ababa in the old DC3 (one side of the passenger cabin had a row of seats against the wall – the other side was all stacked up with cargo) proved to us in his flying that he was still a cowboy. All of us Jesuits who were chosen to go to Addis for the high school or college were hired by the Ethiopian Government office in Montreal, Canada, with the stipulation we were never to show or manifest any external sign of our Roman Catholic religious affiliation, or speak about our religious views or beliefs while we were in any part of Ethiopia. This was in force even though the Ethiopian government at that time was strictly affiliated to the Coptic Christian beliefs. In the country itself every other religion was present, with the Moslems strong in the southern coastal part of country. At meal times my duty was to have all the boys settled for the meal and then the Coptic priest from the small church we had on the school compound would give the blessing. These were poor boys, selected by the Ethiopian government from the villages.</p>
<p>The morning that I returned to Bangalore after the evening meeting when I had agreed to assist Jacqui Schiff I began to realize that I had accepted and to what I had committed myself. I remembered that I had committed to help Jacqui Schiff establish some sort of base for herself in India. So, I spent some time mulling the situation over in my mind, trying to make it all clear. It was all very good to volunteer, but then I had to make all the circumstances clear.</p>
<p>Some young men who were having trouble sorting out their lives and using drugs were coming to me to talk and it was obvious that they seemed to have serious mental problems. I didn’t believe that I had adequate knowledge or training to work with them.</p>
<p>Yet some weeks before one young man had come to me and said that he could not go home as his father had refused to allow him to enter into their home anymore. As a boy this man had been given a very good education. He began to take street drugs, had not gone to college and so was really living on the street, or in one of the building sites were new buildings were coming up. He had come to our front door and the brother who looked after the garden often gave him some work to do and at times gave him a meal in return. He had been in and out of the mental hospital for short periods, and because of his illness had been chased out of his home because on a few occasions he had been violent and disruptive. He was very open to me and would often sit on the steps outside my room and talk with me. He said to me one day – “You can take care of me. You can be like a father to me. My family rejects me and does not want me so you can help me.”</p>
<p>Across the small road next to our property, there was a building being built. So, I said to him, “Velu, if you want me to take care of you, first you must let me see you behave properly. I want you to go over and get a job working as an unskilled helper working on that building. You will go nowhere loafing on the streets and begging. You have to learn to believe in yourself and take care of yourself”. He went immediately, was hired, and worked till they finished that building. There was a small out building in our compound so I told him he could live there while he worked and we would regularly spend time together. And this he did. He related well with me and stayed with me for many months. He behaved appropriately and when we started our therapeutic community, Athma Shakti Vidyalaya, he became a member of the community. But after some time he left and ended up on the streets again.</p>
<p>He would arrange to meet with his father at one of the traffic circles close by. I found his sister who was a teacher in one of the posh schools in the city and discussed with her. The family did not wish to have him living with them. After some time he went back to the street drugs. From time to time I would meet him on one of the streets. Passersby were a bit stymied when this fairly well dressed gentleman received a hearty greeting and hugs from this scruffily unshaven young man seemingly on drugs. Finally he did come around again to join the community. His sister has been giving him financial support for years now. And he lives his own life, settled and content looking after himself close to the community. Recognition and support offered to individuals is often enough to enable people to find themselves and make the necessary moves to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>This may be a good time to speak about the decisive decisions we may often make after a short few moments of consideration that end up becoming the turning point in our life. Such a decision may become a definitive commencing point in a person’s life, causing unplanned new growth or new interest or pursuit for the person. After all, our life grows in meaning as we take a decision, especially if it is a decision that will involve us in causing a benefit to be present in another person’s life. Without really counting how much this new opening may cost us, without evaluating or estimating fully what it will mean by way of adjustment in our own life, we go ahead with confidence, trusting simply in our present willingness which relies on our own present positive experience.</p>
<p>I can remember how one short discussion in a chance meeting on the sidewalk of my home city was the starting point of a complete change in my own life. That change has enabled me to be open and to let go of my limitations and transcend them myself, in a manner that is still causing my life to be more meaningful and expressive for others. This happened to me in my college days. After my third year of college, a year of skipping classes, neglecting studies, involved in sports, I had decided to drop college and stay with a temporary job in an office which kept me with enough money for my regular tavern visits. Then the temporary job fell through so I had nothing, hardly any future unless I could hopefully talk to my father into advancing me some funds.</p>
<p>Then one day I met one of my old professors on the street. He stopped to talk and said I was acting like a no good, no better than a street bum. I had no choice but to stop and listen. I had no way of defending myself. So, I listened. Through his dressing down remarks, I stood and listened. I had no proper defense. I tried to push away his suggestion that I go back to classes by using the fact I didn’t have the necessary money. He kept at me. Finally he challenged me, and my inborn nature has always been to fall into the challenge. His challenge was his offer to take up a job of teaching a small yet regular class of weak students. He said the college needed a Latin tutor and I had done three years of Cicero’s Latin. So, the challenge was there. And there was still some sense in me. I accepted and went back to college and later graduated. And my life developed anew from there, just a chance meeting on a fairly busy city sidewalk. There was a letting go on my part, and in the letting go, I decided at that moment to prove the “I’ll show you” as part of my personality. Yes, I transcended myself in those few minutes, something we need to keep doing in our lives.</p>
<p>You might say this man rescued me in some manner. It was good of him. And in a way I realized it is something I have been doing all my life after the incident, and I became more conscious of myself. I realize that I had recognized the value of putting myself together through the feelings that I had experienced. The feelings I had at the time were movements caused in me by the experience, the actuality of going beyond myself in some way. Feelings are movements that a subject experiences on the existential level of intentional consciousness, for example, when one is in the dynamic state of being in love. This means that, in addition to the practical knowledge there is another kind of knowledge, factual knowledge. Factual knowledge is the knowledge you reach when you experience, understand and verify. This other practical knowledge you attain when you discern and judge the value of something, as for example when you are totally set, as when you are in love or some course of action when you are in love. This I think is the question I proposed to myself at that moment when the old professor proposed the teaching proposal to me. I would have phrased it as, “Is this worthwhile? Is it worthwhile for me to accept his offer? Is this going to help me, to mean something good to me?”</p>
<p>It did mean a lot to me. Being offered the teaching work meant I could earn some money, I could go back to college which I did. This enabled me to finally graduate. I could reestablish my life. That sort of consolation such as I had as I walked away from my former professor was a sort of spiritual consolation. It is as some writers have put it “like a flashlight in the dark, always just enough for finding our way.” It is this we are trying to discover in most of our psychotherapy as we endeavour to bring a person to choose to drop some feelings, or change some attitude, or let go of some negative experience or feeling. We choose because we believe that leaving the negative experience and having some sense of comfort that the new experience invites us to experience, we will be reaching for the relief or fulfillment which we have been searching...</p>
<p>All the foregoing has been a sort of introduction, but with a bias to my life and how Athma Shakti had a real beginning, a beginning that involved many excellent people. As with each and every person who has been mentally ill, there has been a beginning, a beginning of the “problem” as people usually refer to the condition we refer to as “mental illness”. In this presentation we will not go into the different types and forms of mental illness, but on presenting the struggles to assist young persons to move out of what is usually referred to as the many shadows and disruptions that cause the person to be lost and upset.</p>
<p>From its beginning, many years ago Athma Shakti has found it necessary to have a creative and innovated approach to the treatment of mental illness. In the very first years medication was not used and it is questionable whether there has been any better progress coming from the administrating of various types of medication. The main approach in the methodology for holistic psychotherapy treatment of schizophrenia, depression and other mental illness at Athma Shakti Vidyalaya is to put a strong emphasis on reparenting.</p>
<p>Basically, Athma Shakti has always been essentially a community with all the social and healing benefits that are present in community living – attachment, responsibility, mutual support, ever-present healthy dependency, learning from others and facing up to present problems of living and adjusting to others. The main focus has always been on forming a relationship, and for some people, a few relationships. This has been the most helpful treatment modality – relationship.</p>
<p>One of the obvious problems with a person who has serious mental problems is their usual inability to be at ease with other persons: their tendency to withdraw and be alone, especially in their early years in school and often their difficulty in the area of marriage.</p>
<p>The new comer to Athma Shakti is asked to make a contract with the community, making a formal open request in the community to be accepted as a member of the community with a promise to dedicate all his or her efforts to overcoming the mental and behavioural problems they may have and also to assist all others in the community in their efforts to overcome any problems that they may have.</p>
<p>The persons who are sent to Athma Shakti Vidyalaya usually are feeling quite low, they have difficulty in establishing contact with other people. Many have never had meaningful, open contact with other people. Most of them brought here by parents and relatives, have come from some years of treatment, or many years of treatment with psychiatrists and hospitals. They usually find their living difficult because they have great difficulty being open with other people, or cannot express themselves correctly or behave appropriately with others. They often ignore other people, or deny their feelings concerning themselves and others. In many ways they do not understand themselves clearly, nor can they on the spot immediately explain the reasons why they are thinking and behaving in the way they are thinking and behaving. Often it is difficult for them to reflect upon themselves and decide how they want to react.</p>
<p>My first knowledge of reparenting came to me in the 1970s when I was Headmaster of a large residential boarding school for boys in Darjeeling. One winter vacation to find some warmth out of the Himalayan cold I decided to follow a counseling training course at a center in the south of India. And then I met Jacqui Schiff who was on a short visit demonstrating some aspects of her reparenting theory.</p>
<p>In 1979 with some interested parents and therapists, we set up for Jacqui the residential therapeutic community, Athma Shakti Vidyalaya. “Athma” means spirit or soul, or mind as it is used in much eastern religious thought. “Shakti” means power, strength of ability. “Vidyalaya” means school. Since I was a long term resident in India I agreed with the help of Carlos and Saroj Welch to make the necessary arrangements for the community – renting a building, seeing to the legal necessities, visas, etc. Jacqui lived in the community off and on for five years. She spent six months of each year traveling abroad for workshops and seminars. Following her departure the community has continually evolved following its own direction with the reparenting model as an integral aspect of the treatment process.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest manner to present the reparenting model is to choose certain words, which make explicit some elements essential in this treatment process. The treatment takes place in a therapeutic community, where there are connections at many different levels, rich communication, openness, sharing, closeness, demands, responsibilities – all directed to therapy, to bringing the individual to be aware, pay attention, reflect, think. I must mention here a most significant aspect of our ASV community. We believe that persons who are classified as mentally ill, having serious problems, as we say, are able to reach a condition in which they can be aware and in charge of their feelings, know the conscious or unconscious reasons for those feelings, examine the attitudes or beliefs that are often at the base of those feelings, and then act to change whatever is necessary to change in order that he or she can function as any person considered normal in their surroundings. We believe that any person can be brought to think responsibly, feel accepted and able to form attachments with significant other persons and be responsible, no matter how disturbed they might be.</p>
<p>When a newcomer comes into the community he or she will be struck by the interconnected dynamics within the community. They will notice that some individuals seem to spend a good deal of time around certain members of staff. They will pick up an awareness of that special interaction going on and although they cannot describe it they are having their first experience of bonding. I believe it is correct to call it bonding. Remember, we all need to have an experience of bonding in our lives. One of the greatest problems of our world today is depression, the sense of loneliness, the lack of bonding. Bonding is at the root of re-parenting.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to sort out or to explain the how and why a personal connection or attachment is formed. The most efficient step out of a mental illness is taken when a real bonding takes places in a therapeutic community. And there is no progress, no hope for the seriously disturbed person unless there is some small opening, no matter how minuscule, to another person. The disturbed person is usually isolated within himself or herself, very needy yet not knowing how to ask for any positive and meaningful attention. Usually the person has set up a complete system of defenses for protection from a world that has caused great pain and rejection. This barrier of defenses, this wall of denial that is expressed by saying, “There is nothing wrong with me.” must be dissipated, abandoned.</p>
<p>This wall has to melt before any of us can be of any help to the lonely, stricken person. And often there is a history of excessive medication with the result the newcomer doesn’t experience the ability to make a free choice concerning just what is occupying his thinking.</p>
<p>I cannot insist too much on the need of the quiet acceptance of a community to a disturbed newcomer who, as often as he can, may unconsciously be showing his wares, that is, the heights of his pathology to scare us off, to establish his protective wall or shell. The quiet acceptance must come from all members of the community and it is important to know that for some that quiet acceptance is itself considered a fearful situation. I remember a very paranoid young man Raghu, who remained for many months so full of fear of the others in the community, a fear that he showed in his frequent outbursts of anger which I believe took place when he felt he was becoming just a bit too dependent on someone. It is necessary to respect the fear the person may have, for it has held them and served them in the past. Slowly he could relax with others and avoid the anger. He began to appreciate other members of the community and even picked out a staff member whom he finally asked to be a new parent for him. Then a type of formal contract was concluded between him and the staff member. I have quite a few people spread in various parts of the world who still refer to me as “Dad”.</p>
<p>We cannot place any demands on a person becoming at ease in the community. Remember that on entry he has to be present and become familiar with another 25 or 30 persons, accept a demanding routine that keeps him present with others, meet expectations both of time and degree to become at ease enough in the community to open to a connection with the community as a safe and acceptant group or with any one individual be it staff or another kid. (I will use the word ‘kid’ for that is the word we have always used in the community. The word, as common and meaningful is considered very positively by all community members.) It would be unfair and not therapeutic for any staff to make any moves to influence any kid to form a connection or bonding with him. The connection will come in its own time. It may begin at any time. It may happen immediately on the person entering the community. I have had a kid tell me the she made up immediately when she first saw me in the community that she could receive whatever she wanted by way of care and direction from me. She only told me these two years after choosing me as a father for reparenting. It is sad that some of our kids who have come for treatment have not benefited from the treatment as they could have. They may have learned some elements of self care, some responsibility in handling feelings, but are not able to function on their own in the outside world. They have not opened to any sort of personal relationship to anyone in the community. There are kids who have not bonded with a staff member, who have not had the courage to recognize their need of a person to give his or her emotional support and direction. For me this is the true tragedy of mental illness. It is the inner life spent completely isolated from any meaningful relationship to another person.</p>
<p>As Carl Jung writes – ‘‘We have our gift of consciousness as the place where we realize that we are not alone. Our consciousness enables us to have the experience that others exist who offer us caring, enjoyment, pleasure, and yes, ultimately, love. Through these others they learn their own abilities to extend themselves out to others, to feel richer in forming a connection, to experience the wonder of appreciating oneself forming a relationship, to experience the wonder of appreciating another giving to another person, in growing to love.”</p>
<p>Again, I want to emphasize this need of some sort of bonding of the disturbed person within the community, and preferably to a favorite member of staff with whom they have been able to build up some sort of trust. This can often take place in the common routine of the community. Since most newcomers to the community have the usual problem with self care, that is a situation the majority of seriously disturbed persons go through. They will be spending frequent sessions of time with staff being cared for in their daily bath, washing clothes, looking after their bed and other such necessary matters. This is what we call supervision, and is an essential, often unrewarding daily ritual that may go on for months and months. It is often difficult for a seriously disturbed person to learn a steadily repeated routine. The supervision process is often the means by which the individual learns to take responsibility for self, for example just by remembering what is needed to take a proper shower. Then the learning of various chores that are the basis of community living are occasions for interaction between members of staff and kids. Then there are the different treatment groups which are in some way the most important groups and the special time of day. There are four groups consisting of seven of eight kids each with two or three staff in each group. The groups are all talk therapy groups. There is some formal stress in the group as the members are expected to consider, seriously, just where he or she has reached in their goal therapy, and what individual issue he or she is working on at present. The kid will have formulated just what issue or issues he or she is clarifying and engaged with in their treatment process. These groups are considered most valuable in the process of overcoming the traumas, recognizing the contaminated thinking, digging out the roots in the past that is causing the irresponsible functioning today, searching their way through to wellness.</p>
<p>Usually the first task given a newcomer is to keep a daily journal of feelings, to write down his feelings in a notebook or diary and learn to speak about these with a staff member in his small group. Often the disturbed person has no awareness of the different feelings that they have been experiencing and have usually never had the opportunity to speak about. The only usual method of handling feelings they know about is to act them out in some way by sitting in a catatonic state, or experiencing a violent outburst, or pacing up and down incessantly. Whenever a family brings a sibling to referral one of the first queries I put to the person is concerning what the person does with their feelings. All treatment must begin with the feelings that are in the person’s awareness. The person may have never been in a situation where anyone has ever asked them simply in a positive and helping manner about their feelings and respected their feelings, no matter what they are. I often consider the treatment of seriously disturbed persons as beginning in a very simple manner. The therapist has to have a high degree of skill to enable the person to comfortably begin to recognize their feelings and then actually talk about them. I stress the word “comfortably” for often it has been very discomforting for a person who has not searched out their past feelings to recognize their feelings from the past. In all this work we want the person to make the necessary attempt to find comfort in a world that he or she finds distressing. By becoming more aware of their thought and feelings they will be able to find some comfort. Being forced to actualize the past can be very distressing. So, there is always a need of a simple, clear approach that is respectful and supportive.</p>
<p>Through this process the person will begin to experience a difference in the therapists. He will feel more comfortable with one staff member rather than another, beginning to select the one he prefers to speak with or have supervising him, who agrees to take him for shopping or to the dentist. The newcomers will see how the older kids behave with different members of staff. How some seem to be always asking special ones, or seem to be around a certain staff person much of the time. They will notice who asks which staff for physical strokes. They will notice how some wait expectantly for that person to come in the morning. And some will speak of missing one who is having a day off. They notice that some are attached to a member of staff in a special manner, and seem happy to be attached. This attachment is again often the basis of getting well, the first step in the reparenting process.</p>
<p>Last year one of the kids in the community, one who could function and hold down a job but with great stress on himself described for me the trauma he went through as he tried to establish a state of bonding with me. He felt relief as he grew accustomed to the contact which he would make with me. He wished to develop a contact with me and appreciated his growing attachment with me. I use the word “trauma” deliberately for that is what it was for him. He had never experienced a close attachment before. There were innumerable questions that came up to him, questions he was afraid to ask, being afraid of rejection. There were the moments he wanted to stop and ask me something, yet didn’t have the courage, being at the same time envious of the ease with which other kids could be with me. He could sense their security as they were spending time with me and picking up ease and comfort by being with me. The security he experienced gave him the openness and relationship he needed to gain confidence within himself. This confidence gave him the strength to be open and feel at ease. With this confidence he began to realize that the forming of an attachment was an opening to an ease with other people and sharing being around and yet hesitant because of the demands I made on them.</p>
<p>Because of the manner in which so many have shared with me I remain open and ready for any statement from any kid.</p>
<p>Someone may ask me the reason for the bonding in the first place. I fall back on my belief that we will not make any changes in our life just for ourselves. We change because some one wants us to change, we change because of our relationship to someone else be it God, a parent, a friend, a loved one, an enemy, or it may be the memory of that relationship. We may not experience within ourselves the power to make the necessary change. To break out of the isolation of mental illness the person has to break out of the limitations she places around herself, and to bond with another.</p>
<p>Always, for any altercation, differences must be discussed, recognized, accepted, responsibility taken, renewed and proper behaviour promised. Unhelpful behaviours and contaminated thinking must be confronted. Contaminated thinking usually happens when a person’s thinking is obviously based on some disordered feeling or belief with the result that the misbehaviours or nasty interactions taking place, there are supervised “time outs”, explanations demanded, responsibility taken.</p>
<p>Essential in the beginning of any person’s stay at ASV is the history taking, or a recital of the bio data, especially the experience of the early years of family living and the beliefs and attitudes that are carried from that time in a person’s life. There may be painful and disturbing memories and incorrect beliefs and attitudes that may have caused the person mental health problems in the present time.</p>
<p>And there are birthdays, farewell parties, fun times, and outings to break the routine.</p>
<p>Since Transactional Analysis gives a simple living diagram of the feelings, thinking, and values – Child, Adult, Parent, community members can easily understand and communicate using the terms and structures from T.A. Each member of the staff has attended at some time a workshop in TA. The original idea for ASV came through contact with Jacqui Schiff who was a close friend of Eric Berne, the psychiatrist who originated TA in the original Tuesday night workshops of psychiatrists in San Francisco. TA enables the members of the community to plainly discuss all the aspects of personality structures and communications between persons. When a person is acting, feeling, thinking as you observed parents to be doing, you are in your Parent ego state. When you are dealing with current reality, gathering facts, and computing objectively, you are in your Adult ego state. When you are feeling and acting as you did when you were a child, you are in your Child ego state.</p>
<p>The Parent ego state contains the attitudes and behavior incorporated from external sources, primarily parents. Outwardly, it often is expressed toward others in prejudicial, critical, and nurturing behavior. Inwardly, it is experienced as old Parental messages which continue to influence the inner Child.</p>
<p>The Adult ego state is not related to a person’s age, it is oriented to current reality, and the objective gathering of information. It is organized, adaptable, intelligent, and functions by testing reality, estimating probabilities, and computing dispassionately.</p>
<p>The Child ego state contains all the impulses that come naturally to an infant. It also contains the recordings of the child’s early experiences, responses, and the “positions” taken about self and others. It is expressed as old behavior from childhood.</p>
<p>In the past few years ASV has become a member of the Community of Communities, a quality improvement and accrediation program of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, U.K. for Therapeutic Communities. Because of financial constraints ASV is not a registered member now but keeps regular contact with Dr. Rex Haigh, the initiator of the Community of Communities. The association with the C of C has been a great help and welcome challenge to ASV.</p>
<p>Since, ASV believes that the mentally disturbed person can be supported to learn acceptance and use their feelings appropriately in order to live a meaningful life, and follow their attitudes and beliefs to guide their growth and their awareness, reasoning and understanding to coordinate their decisions in life and their vital interactions with other people, a particular emphasis is always placed on confronting the individual who is not using those three capabilities in an appropriate manner. Along with being confronted the person’s who are not appropriate in expressing themselves or not communicating adequately with others will be expected to clarify the source of their problem and rectify their communication.</p>
