 		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he Athma Shakti Vidyalaya community was established on 20th August 1979, in the suburbs of Bangalore, a city in South India. The community functioned in different rented facilities for nineteen years. On 20th June 1998, the community moved into their own building located in the suburbs of Bangalore. This sprawling building which can comfortably accommodate 25 patients at any given time has a ground, first & second floors Each room is occupied by six patients. All the rooms have attached bath and toilet facilities There is a large area designated for the garden.</p>
<p>Who gets referred to ASV? Patients who have been diagnosed at some time or times having any kind of mental illness are referred to ASV. Most patients will have undergone crisis management programmes in hospitals. When discharged they still continue to have positive and negative symptoms of the illness, i.e. hallucinations, delusions, odd behaviors like getting up late, excessive eating, being lethargic, drinking excessive amounts of tea, smoking etc. When these behaviors are confronted by family members, the conflict starts and the patients may become violent and abusive or suicidal. Most often they will be back into hospital stay. As the medication alone will not deal with the multifarious problems caused by the patients, the need for therapeutic communities arose. ASV is one of the pioneers in establishing the therapeutic communities in India when it opened in 1979. There are a number of such organizations now in Bangalore.</p>
<p>The ASV therapeutic community offers structure and discipline to the patients till they are able to cope with their own inner experience and meaningful with expectations of family and society. The staff also teaches living skills and vocational skills to the patients. They are also taught personal hygiene and good values. Patients diagnosed with manic - depression are difficult to treat, as they tend to escalate beyond the resources of the community during psychotic phases. For e.g. some patients get into violent episodes and become destructive and vengeful. They often persist in keeping up this escalated phase till the staff and patients are physically and psychologically exhausted. In a couple of cases, patients had to be shifted to hospitals because of their unmanageable behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions for intake : </strong></p>
<p>After a preliminary interview with the patient and the family, a psychological assessment of the patient is made.</p>
<p>A detailed history of the patient includes, genetics, socioeconomic background, any birth trauma, neurological problems, premorbid personality, psychosexual history, any substance abuse, drug or alcohol abuse, education, occupation, marital status etc.</p>
<p>A psychological assessment includes tests for perception, subjective and objective tests of personality, intelligence tests and tests for organicity.</p>
<p>A mental status examination is also conducted to assess his orientation, cognitive skills, awareness, level of reactivity, etc.</p>
<p>The case is then presented in the staff meeting. The staff as a whole decides whether to admit the patient or not depending on the following reasons.</p>
<p>-Motivation of the patient to get well</p>
<p>-His or her awareness of the illness</p>
<p>-Age- younger patients are preferred (as their<br />maladaptive behaviours are easier to change than that<br />of older patients)</p>
<p>-Chronicity of the illness</p>
<p>-Is the person going to be a management problem?</p>
<p>-Is the person going to be resource to the community?<br />(Can he or she motivate the other patients to get well)</p>
<p>-Availability of accommodation</p>
<p>We have fifteen staff members working in ASV. As we work twenty-four hours and 365 days a year, the staff is rotarized to work in different shifts. The staff consists of psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and young adults who are motivated and committed to this work.</p>
<p>Jacqui Schiff, who started this community, was a student of Eric Berne, who introduced Transactional Analysis to the world, we relate on the principle of “I AM OK – YOU ARE OK”. The staff are addressed by their first names and there are very little hierarchical differences between staff and patients.</p>
<p>Once the decision is made to take the patient in, he or she is asked to come to the community as a day patient for a week. During this period, the patient participates in all the activities of the community. Then the patient can decide to join as an inpatient and makes a contract.</p>
<p>-To abide by the rules of the community and<br /> -To use the resources of the community to get well and help others get well.</p>
<p>When the patient decides to join the community, he or she is given a traditional welcome with aarthi and garland. He or she is assigned to a room. His personal belongings are scrutinized for sharp objects, or bottles that could be used as a weapon to hurt oneself or others. These are then kept in the custody of the staff. He or she is assigned a buddy who will help the new patient become oriented to the rules of the community and to other members.</p>
<p>The staff will then assess the level of functioning and his or her therapeutic issues. Patients are classified into three groups according to the level of their functioning.</p>
<dl>
<dt>– </dt><dd><strong>Dysfunctional : </strong>The patient suffers from poor awareness of self and the environment, active hallucinations, poor personal hygiene, inability to care for self, irrational behavior, irrelevant talk and psychotic behavior. </dd>
<dt>– </dt><dd><strong>Reasonable : </strong>He or she is aware of self and the environment, can care for self, accessible to psychotherapy. He or she is able to think and reason, take minimal responsibility towards self and others in the community. </dd>
<dt>– </dt><dd><strong>Responsible : </strong>He or she is aware of self and the environment, able to care for self and others, go out on their own, aware of their problems, feelings and their needs. He or she has drawn an ability to hold a job outside of the community, ability to manage money etc. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Depending on their level of functioning, their individual structures are defined.</p>
<p><strong>Structures for Dysfunctional people : </strong></p>
<p>The dysfunctional patient is on full supervision and is given suitable parenting for learning basic living skills.</p>
<p>They are taught to bathe properly, keep their clothes clean, brush their teeth, eat appropriately etc.</p>
<p><strong>Structures for Reasonable people : </strong></p>
<p>A reasonable patient can work on his own responsibly but he / she cannot be trusted or is capable of handling relations with others. For example being untrustworthy, unable to quietly discuss and settle disputes, or not acting according to the values of the community.</p>
<p>Some patients have problems in specific areas for e.g. in the bathroom, they use excessive amounts of soap or they have issues associated with food. Depending on this they have a free structure.</p>
<p><strong>Structures for Responsible People </strong></p>
<p>-They can go out on their own</p>
<p>-They can supervise the less functional patients</p>
<p>-They can function as mentors for other patients</p>
<p>-They can opt to work outside the community.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment process: </strong></p>
<p>Athma Shakti Vidyalaya is a community, with a very special aim. This aim flows from its character, its nature. The common aim of ASV is to do whatever is possible for the promotion of the mental health of all the persons who have come to be connected in any manner with the community.</p>
<p>Each member of the community grows through their own personal struggle to bring about the aim of the community. The objective to be obtained is that each individual has a gratifying and fulfilling shared experience with other members of the community.</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs I will refer to some of the daily structures which the members of the community need to follow in order for the community to be a success. As already explained, “Structure” is a rule, a demand, a necessity, a need to be followed, an expectation made on each member, in some ways a contract, a routine, a trust that each member of the community is required to accept, follow, pay close attention to help others follow, and also challenge another member of the community if the structure is neglected.</p>
<p>The first structure of the day is the wakeup call at 6.30 am for the hour long yoga session at 7.00 am. After breakfast comes the distribution of psychotropic medication – daily shower bath, doing one’s own laundry, getting organized and if time, catching up on writing in one’s daybook or chronicle – relating the various ups and downs of the previous days – all of which will be presented and discussed with a favorite staff guide.</p>
<p>At 11.00 am the community comes together at the Daily Meeting – the formal opening of the day with a couple of common questions at the beginning to spark an attempt to get the little grey cells of the brain moving. Then any special business to be discussed is presented.</p>
<p>The special business may include some “lo and behold breakage of structure” – Some culprit may have played loosely with one of the community’s usual behaviors, practices or customs – so as in a village assembly the culprit must give the proper explanation – and may be (according to the mood of the day or discernment of the community) made to stand in the corner (much like he had to when in kindergarten) until he can explain what feelings and thoughts he was having when he “acted out” (broke structure). To break structure is to act in any manner that goes against the rules of the community, the spirit of the community, and commitments that he or she may have made earlier to the community. If he or she can convince the gathered community members of his or her determination to come back to the original commitment made on joining the community, that he or she explains how he or she will creditably manage to follow all the different structures, as he convinces the community that he is committed to adaptation and change – clearer or different thinking – he or she can be easily again classified as a functioning member of the community.</p>
<p>It sounds very formal when presented there on paper but really it often is a verbal bickering for correctness back and forth until a decision is reached and in the process much growth in discernment and responsibility often is the result.</p>
<p>Over the years this demand that the structure be strictly followed has been very helpful for people. And it is often very difficult to have visitors accept the value of the effort that is put into this “following structure”. It has been very beneficial and has been very helpful for many people. It has started many off on a new rational, responsible life. I can refer to quite a few individuals who opened themselves to make the necessary drastic changes in the feeling and thought patterns of their personality when they were standing “in the corner” – and those needed changes enabled them to move on to live a responsible healthy normal life outside the community.</p>
<p>So, after the Daily Meeting and a coffee break the community divides itself up into three or four “therapy groups”. These morning sessions of one and a half hours are considered as important for the ongoing aspect of the therapy in the same group day by day. It is usually in these groups where the serious insights may come forward. The groups are divided on the patient’s level of competence in self-knowledge and grasp of difficulties as explained earlier in this paper.</p>
<p>A young man may be a computer expert, but can he handle the little and the big – upsets that grow from within?</p>
<p>Within the first three months of the patient’s arrival in the community, his therapeutic issues come into focus.</p>
<p>For e.g. Patient ‘M’ was admitted because of his violent behavior, irrelevant talk, attention seeking behavior, psychosomatic problems etc.</p>
<p>He was defined as reasonable person as he was also showing good functioning in many other areas. He was assigned some jobs like being on laundry committee, pumping up water etc.</p>
<p>He had problems in the following area: he would try to get attention by talking incessantly, being intrusive, wetting bed, refusing to sleep at night etc.</p>
<p>His maladaptive behaviour was confronted and appropriate behaviors for getting attention were suggested and reinforced. He was put on a program to be quiet for 15 minutes twice a day and that stopped his non-stop chattering behavior.</p>
<p>He calmed down considerably and could sleep at night. He also stopped wetting his bed. He was taught to connect his feelings, needs and thoughts and to use them productively rather than destructively. He was also taught to think of options for problem solving and to choose the best option for getting his needs met.</p>
<p>After the initial orientation process of each patient, they will be assigned in specific programs to deal with specific issues. For example if a patient is showing thinking disorder, he will be put on a program to talk or write an essay which shows the level of his thinking disorder and then the therapist can find out what exactly is the internal process of that person’s thinking and it can be corrected.</p>
<p>The whole process of analyzing each thought, belief or attitude will take an hour or two and slowly the person generalizes and incorporates new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>If a patient is talking non-stop to get the attention, he is put on a program to ask for attention in a straight way for a specific amount of time. He will also be put on a quiet program where he is expected to be quiet three times a day for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Another patient shows perceptual problems and redefines reality. She misperceives any eligible bachelor to be proposing to her. She will then be made to talk to that bachelor and clear up her thinking.</p>
<p>The strength of the community lies in its group work. Over the past twenty years, several innovative groups have evolved to cater to different needs of the patients.</p>
<p><strong>Briefly they are as follows: </strong></p>
<p>As we believe in holistic healing, many body-mind techniques are incorporated into our programs. Yoga, psychophysical exercises, neurological exercises, sports, swimming, aerobics, patterning are included in their daily programs.</p>
<p>Some patients have shown blocks in thinking because their neural pathways are not developed. We use evolutionary exercises, Doman –Delacato techniques to stimulate and develop the neural pathways. At times, patients who have been very rigid in thinking have been patterned to loosen up and be more flexible in dealing with problems (like patient lies in a prone position and people move his limbs and head in a specific way.</p>
<p><strong>Marathon: </strong></p>
<p>The community gets together for three hours on a particular day of the week. Several patients work on their personal issues in this big group and get support from each other. This will also enable the patients to be aware of each other’s problem and be confrontive and supportive to it.</p>
<p><strong>Mentor groups : </strong></p>
<p>The patients set short term goals and both staff and other patients help in the process of achieving these goals.</p>
<p>For e.g. patients and staff help an overweight person to reduce her weight, to follow the diet and exercise regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Neuro-Linguistic Programming </strong></p>
<p>These exercises help reprogrammed the brain for specific behaviour changes. For e.g. ‘A’ patient who was rocking on the bed as he was going over certain events that he was upset with during the day. We brought this process forward by using fantasy work and we decided to deal with his upsets before going to bed. He stopped rocking.</p>
<p><strong>Values and Script : </strong></p>
<p>This group is for patients who have achieved the last stage of treatment and need their values clarified and to change their script so that they do not get into problems again. Values around money, sex, job, relationships are discussed and they will incorporate and feel strong with their values.</p>
<p><strong>Art, Music, Dance groups : </strong></p>
<p>These groups help the patients express their selves spontaneously. This is of benefit specially for people who do not express verbally.</p>
<p><strong>Medication : </strong></p>
<p>Patients who are in psychotic state cannot be accessed by psychotherapy. These people get psychotropic medication prescribed by a consultant psychiatrist. At times medication is used to reduce anxiety, stop hallucinations and delusions. After the patient progresses in treatment, medication is slowly weaned off.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment groups : </strong></p>
<p>In this group patients work on their long term goals. For example dealing with anger in an appropriate way rather than getting violent. The patient is asked to keep track of his anger and note it down in a book every day. He is also asked to note the level of anger on a 0 to 10 scale. He is asked to assess the appropriateness of his anger, options he has and choosing the best option keeping in mind, his needs, others needs and the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Boys – girls groups </strong></p>
<p>Issues specific to either gender is brought up and discussed openly. Especially beliefs around sex. Outings are planned so that it brings cohesiveness in the group.</p>
<p><strong>Individual time : </strong></p>
<p>Apart from groups the patients work on specific issues with therapists to whom they are attached to.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict Resolution </strong></p>
<p>Conflicts come up almost every day as the members of the community have to coexist. These are brought up in to the open and resolved keeping the goal in focus.</p>
<p><strong>Communication skills : </strong></p>
<p>In order to build better understanding between members of the community, people need to learn the art of communicating with clarity. Apart from that, the therapist will have to understand the patient’s frame of reference. So the therapist will have to develop the skill of listening and relating to patient’s frame of reference.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics : </strong></p>
<p>Once a year, the patients are assessed on an objective personality questionnaire to get an overall picture of the functioning of the community, differences between groups etc.</p>
<p><strong>Subjective Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Apart from objective assessment, the patients are assessed every month on the following scales:</p>
<p>-Mental status</p>
<p>-Cognitive skills</p>
<p>-Motivation</p>
<p>-Medication changes</p>
<p>-Sleep patterns</p>
<p>-Mood fluctuations</p>
<p>-Living skills</p>
<p>-Short term goals</p>
<p>-Insight</p>
<p>After the person has been functioning responsibly for a consistent period of time, he is encouraged either to continue studies or find a job outside the community.</p>
<p>The patients continue to stay in the community seeking support from its members and work or study outside during the day.</p>
<p>After they have learnt to cope with the stress of the outside world and are confident enough, they are encouraged to move out of the community.</p>
<p><strong>Farewell : </strong></p>
<p>Farewell is a big affair in the community as each person’s getting well is celebrated by everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Follow up : </strong></p>
<p>The patients keep in touch with the community through telephone, e-mail, letters, visits etc. They will always be the members of the big family.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Language of TA -Transactional Analysis </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">O</span>ver many years from the time of Eric Berne, the language of TA has been written and re-written depending on the context this very versatile tool has been used in. I have come across an article with the first couple of pages missing, may be a part of a student's research paper in the UK. The author has written about the language and methodology used in Connect Therapeutic Community which was established in 1987. What is special about Connect is that it's philosophy and methodology has roots in Athma Shakti Vidyalaya and therefore I am reproducing this article as it represents the original ideas and methodology very clearly and crisply.</p>
<p>Three distinct ways of presenting myself – what is the experience of myself that I am having-</p>
<p>What are my feelings ?</p>
<p>What am I thinking about ?</p>
<p>What are my present attitudes, my standards, plans?</p>
<p>Do I recognize the difference in the three? It is important to make the distinction between the three. How a person can get the three mixed up-</p>
<p>Always need to know where you are coming from.</p>
<p>To be aware of the experience of being me.</p>
<p>Be aware – is to know and in control of myself.</p>
<p>To know what result you want to feel within yourself and how you will bring this about?</p>
<p>To be always willing to think about, consider my attitudes,</p>
<p>My feelings, what I want for myself.</p>
<p>How do I know I am right in the way I am thinking?</p>
<p>What is most important when I am not sure of myself?</p>
<p>What is the reason we always need to be open to feedback from others?</p>
<p>When do I admit that I may be wrong ?</p>
<p>How do I know that I am wrong?</p>
<p>Why do I have to listen to others, to know what they think? How do I come to be in charge of myself ? What keeps happening over and over again for me, or to me? What always seems to be a difficulty for me? If I could change one special behaviour in myself, what will it be? How would I want to change it?</p>
<p>Transactional Analysis provides a general theory of personality with a therapeutic methodology. It also provides the community with a direct and concise vocabulary with which to communicate to each other about psychological and emotional experiences in day to day living. In its intention to remain accessible for everyday use (and to stay clear of the style of intellectualising which could be anti-therapeutic in terms of “real” relating), it can sometimes, appear itself as jargonistic and excluding to “outsiders”. We have found however, that people joining the community very quickly become attuned to the language and are able to use it productively for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The Theoretical Framework of the Community </strong></p>
<p>Eric Berne (I have quoted from Eric Berne and added my comments) states that the basic interest of TA is the study of ego states which are coherent systems of thought and feeling manifested by corresponding patterns of behaviour. Three types of ego state can be observed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Those derived from parental figures, colloquially called the Parent. In this state a person feels, thinks, acts, talks and responds just as one of his parents did when he was little. This ego state is active, for example, in raising his own children. Even when he is not actually exhibiting this ego state, it influences his behaviour as the “parental influence”, performing (ideally) the functions of a conscience. </li>
<li>The ego state in which he appraises his environment objectively, and calculates its possibilities and probabilities </li>
<figure>
	<img src="images/0005.jpg" alt="image" />
			<figcaption>Figure A  Figure B  Figure C</figcaption>
			</figure>
<li>Each person carries within a little boy or a little girl who feels, thinks, acts, talks, and responds just the way he did when he was a child of a certain age. This ego state is called the child. The child is not regarded as “childish” or “immature” which are parental words, but as childlike, meaning like a child of a certain age. It is important for the individual to understand his Child, not only because it is going to be with him all his life, but also because it is the most valuable part of his personality. </li>
</ol>
<p>Figure A purports to be a complete personality diagram of any human being encompassing everything he may feel, think, say or do. A more detailed analysis does not yield new ego states, but only subdivisions within the primary ones. Thus for example (Fig B) two Parental components can be described and two child components. It can also be seen (Fig C) that within the child ego state the Parent, Adult and Child components that were present when the child was fixated are still present. These are particularly relevant in understanding primitive disturbances. Separation of feeling and behaviour pattern from one another is called structural analysis. Ego states are denoted P-A-C(capitals).</p>
<p>From the above, it is evident that when two people confront each other, there are six ego states involved, three in each person. What happens can be represented by arrows drawn between the two “people” in the diagram (Fig D).</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/0006.jpg" alt="image" />
			<figcaption>Figure D</figcaption>
			</figure>
<p>In the simplest transactions, the arrows are parallel, and these are called complementary transactions. Fig D as an example, represents a PC transaction between two spouses in which the stimulus is from the wife’s Parent ego state to the husbands Child ego state, and the response is from his Child to her Parent. This might represent a motherly wife taking care of a grateful husband. As long as the transactions are complementary with parallel arrows, the communication proceeds indefinitely.</p>
<figure>

			<figcaption>Figure E</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
	<img src="images/0008.jpg" alt="image" />
			<figcaption>Figure F</figcaption>
			</figure>
<p>In Fig E an Adult to Adult stimulus such as a request for information receives a Child to Parent response, so that the stimulus and response arrows instead of being parallel, are crossed. This is known as a crossed transaction, and in such a situation communication breaks down. For example, the husband asks “Where are my socks? And the wife replies “why do you always blame me for everything?”. This represents the common form of transference reaction as it occurs in psychotherapy. Fig. F represents a crossed transaction in which an Adult to Adult stimulus, such as a question, received a patronizing or pompous Parent – Child response, which is perhaps the commonest type of counter transference reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Theory of Reparenting in a community </strong></p>
<p>This basic introduction to TA as a theory of personality perhaps offers some clues about the operational framework used in the community. The following describes a “reparenting” community using TA as an organizing principle.</p>
<p>In some severe cases of disturbance it can be observed that instead of a coherent, internally and externally supportive Parent ego state there is instead a hostile and destructive influence at work. Further, this destructiveness and hostility can, under certain circumstances, be exchanged for a Parent ego state which is more supportive of the whole personality. Essentially this involves letting go of old values and definitions and taking in new.</p>
<p>In the community this involves a process of developing Adult ego state coherence and clarity at a thinking and behavioural level, to a point at which an individual has the capacity and personal responsibility for contracting away enough “Parental” definition of reality, to the community’s consensual reality. (see section on “confrontation” and fig. G for discussion about conflict resolution between different definitions of reality.) Thereby in the process and with the support of a key parental figure, the patient makes an exchange of parent ego state. (changes such as these are always different in timing and intensity between individuals. Occasionally a dramatic shift can be observed but a gradual and incremental change is the most common experience). This is experienced as a reduction of internal conflict and makes a more conventional style of psychotherapy possible from then on. In TA terms this involves a process of “redeciding” early beliefs held in a child ego state and subsequent “deconfusion” of the whole personality. Perhaps this makes explicit the essential nature of what happens more covertly in most helping relationships.</p>
<p>The potential for either conscious or unconscious abuse in all such uneven power relationships is obvious and there is good reason for only attempting reparenting in a therapeutic community setting with all established patterns of external supervision. Active encouragement of visitors and guests is also a valuable way of externally monitoring power relationships within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Method and process of study </strong></p>
<p>Given the task of articulating a coherent theoretical and practical model of reparenting we were mindful of a “parental” value which, given the nature of the way we work, should influence the process by which an account of our community is developed, which is inclusiveness. Specifically, a healthy community seeks to include all it’s members and authentic leadership involves holding this as a priority.</p>
<p>With this in mind we undertook a series of meetings involving residents, staff and an external consultant Rex Haigh under the general heading of “what would we as individuals see as important in communicating to others what it is that we do?” This generated a list of ideas which addressed questions of the “community philosophy” at various degrees of abstraction.</p>
<p>The ideas put forward included the distribution and exercise of power and authority in terms of continuity and long term security, how the need and expectation for that long term security can be met through open ended contracts, the importance of many issues surrounding food as a metaphor for the nurturant qualities of the community, the role of a communal myth in building cohesiveness – including the power of “moving on” and growing up” celebrations with their attendant rites of passage, and the sense of belonging which underpins the difference between being “in” and being “part of”.</p>
<p>The distillation, focusing and development of these discussions forms the material which is presented in the following sections.</p>
<p><strong>Key characteristics of the community </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Expectations </strong></p>
<p>High expectations are made of all residents for appropriate behavior, taking responsibility for their own actions and working to get “well”. Many residents act in weird or crazy ways when they first come to the community. Very soon they are told that they are expected to act appropriately. Residents are also given the reassurance that the staff still know about the depth of problem that they are dealing with, and that they will be responded to accordingly.</p>
<p>In their past, residents report having learned to act more and more bizarrely in order to be noticed and to be taken care of. This is often specifically reported by conventional psychiatric institutions; in this setting, as soon as patients behave more appropriately they are seen as doing well and are discharged. Seldom did this take account of somebody’s still feeling confused and vulnerable “inside” and continuing to want the protection of the hospital. The only way for this person to maintain a place on the ward is by acting out again. In this community, residents change their behavior significantly when they hear and trust that they will not be sent away when they act in a normal way.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle of this community is that all adults are, or can be, responsible for their own reactions. The fact of having severe problems is not accepted as an excuse for acting out. It is necessary to take this position in order to make the demand on somebody to take responsibility for his actions and expedite resolution of the problems which lie beneath all instances of acting out. The attitude of excusing irresponsible or inappropriate behaviour of people with severe emotional problems is seen as inappropriate in treating them as fragile, hopeless and irreversibly handicapped – perhaps unlike many institutions, who respond to escalating disorder with apparent understanding and the attitude that they “couldn’t help it”.</p>
<p>Within the community the expectation for every resident is to go through the whole therapy process and to have a fulfilling and satisfying life afterwards, in contrast to previously having been told that the most they could have hoped for would have been to manage life with almost inevitable relapses and the necessity for medication. A self-fulfilling prophecy of low expectations might be of special relevance to disturbed people and this community aims to offer an expectation of living life instead of managing it, and a new perspective for the future. Residents often internalize the encouragement that it is possible to solve their problems and use it as motivation to make robust and comprehensive changes.</p>
<p>There is a paradoxical quality to discussions about “acting out” and the important linkage with “expectations”. What the community aims to achieve is a culture of high expectations about standards of social behaviour balanced against a realistic understanding of the complexities of “acting out” behaviors. The next section about “structure” describes how a structured environment provides a “background” against which people can and do (but “shouldn’t”) act out in “low level” ways for instance, by breaking minor rules without putting themselves or others at risk. For a discussion of the consequences of repeated “high level” acting out. See the section on “non contracts”.</p>
<p><strong>2. Structure </strong></p>
<p>The discussions frequently return to the concept of community “structure”, how it is enforced, and the values that underpin it.</p>
<p>The structure includes a clear daily routine, organizing and running the household (residents do the shopping, cleaning and cooking) and a large number of rules which are expected to be kept by everybody, including staff. This tight net of structure is used instead of drugs, and it provides a safe and predictable environment. People use it as a background against which they can display their problems.</p>
<p>One of the primary values in this community is to ensure safety and security. This is important in order to provide a setting in which residents feel sufficiently secure to face and work through their problems. The use of structure and rules is a useful tool to put this value into practice.</p>
<p>As already highlighted, in their past many residents needed to act out at increasingly extreme levels in order to be noticed. This was often true within their families as well as within psychiatric institutions. In this community, we believe that residents will give a number of signals before they act out in a destructive or threatening way. The following example illustrates the different approach in the community.</p>
<p>One of the most important rules is about sharp objects. A number of residents have had problems about cutting themselves or have strong impulses to hurt others. To address this problem a “sharp knife drawer” is set aside in which all sharp objects are kept. The rule is that everybody has to clean and put a knife back into the drawer directly after its use. This means that at no time should any sharp object by lying around unused. However, if a knife is found left out, a “structure meeting” is called immediately. That means that every member of the community has to come together immediately. This meeting will investigate who left the knife out and why. Sometimes it is a genuine oversight. However, there are also many occasions when somebody is giving a sign that he wants to hurt himself or somebody else. That person might not be consciously aware that he is upset, or he might be scared to talk about it. In this meeting he or she gets support – to find out what the upset is about and how to deal with it. If the problem is more complex and cannot be solved immediately, plans are made to protect the person as well as others until it is resolved.</p>
<p>This example shows that an escalation is prevented by “the structure” preempting any hazard, and picking up the very first signal of an upset – and by responding to it at the level required for communal safety.</p>
<p>The community has developed a variety of structured responses which are most often in evidence where there is a perceived threat to individual or group security. These are designed to provide a safe space and containment of a resident’s destructive impulses, and constitute an additional boundary within the community's “holding” environment. It also gives residents an opportunity to examine and resolve primitive problems which get acted out rather than spoken about. Colloquially, “living room” and “be with” structured responses are the most used, and make high demands on the resources of the community, both residents and staff. The former involves the resident contracting to stay within the confines of the living room under supervision until such time as he is feeling calmer and is convincingly safe. The community value of inclusiveness demands that an individual not be sent away from the main focus of community life</p>
<p>(i.e. the living room) but he is somehow included even though his behavior might be particularly obnoxious. The latter involves a resident taking responsibility for using community resources and contracting to “be with” someone all the time. This structure is particularly useful when residents are considered to be at suicide risks. It also demands a degree of personal responsibility in negotiating transitions from one “be with” partner to another, which often results in a healthy peer pressure as motivation for change.</p>
<p>A different aspect of structure is teaching people how to organize their lives. Doing daily jobs such as cleaning, shopping and cooking helps residents to learn how to run a household successfully, and gives a good foundation for an independent life after finishing the therapy. A predictable, time-structured day engenders feelings of safety and security in people who are internally fragmented. Structure provides an external framework to rely on in the absence of internal coherence.</p>
<p>Structure in the community is both rigid and flexible. It is rigid in the sense that some of it is a reflection of non-negotiable, core values such as those about violence and stealing, and flexible in the sense that some of it changes and develops out of experience in the community, and is negotiable.</p>
<p>For example, a part of the structure is to hold a “feelings check” when anyone notices an escalating situation, and this is done in a pre-structured way, so that everyone is sure to be heard. There is an accepted protocol in community life that any request or demand for a “feelings check” or a “structure meeting” will be met with respect and given priority over anything else that may be going on at the time. Discussions involving competition and scarcity can lead to quite escalated situations, and it is readily observed that malignant dynamics here can be circumvented by any member calling for a “feelings check”. This element of structure has a calming effect and allows rational (“Adult”) discussion to supervene?</p>
<p><strong>3. Rules </strong></p>
<p>This is hierarchy of rules in the community:<br /> “A rules” are strictly adhered to,<br /> “B rules” are carefully adhered to, and<br /> “C rules” are considerately adhered to.</p>
<p>Reflects a continuum of rules from rigid to flexible and also seems to bear a direct correspondence to “primary process” development in infants, and the need for some nonnegotiable boundaries in that development. In later developmental stages, a more flexible structure can be tolerated on account of growing emotional maturity and the capacity to contain ambivalence.</p>

<p><strong>4. Contracts </strong></p>
<p>The way contracts are used in this community is an important therapeutic tool. Four are commonly used: the therapy contract, the membership contract, the “non contract” and the “parenting contract”.</p>
<p>Every resident makes a therapy contract at the beginning of his involvement with the community. It includes a confrontation contract (see below) and an agreement to work through problems and to support others in working through theirs. It also covers a commitment to keep to the rules.</p>
<p>All members of the community, including staff and long term trainees, make a membership contract. It includes a commitment to confront others when necessary, to do so from a caring position, and to respond to confrontations from others appropriately. The principles behind this and its operation are discussed in the next section. Membership contracts also incorporate a commitment to keep the rules and to keep confidentiality.</p>
<p>The “non contract” is a specific contract developed to deal with the occasions on which residents are unable to adhere to their therapy contracts, it is an important tool for understanding and working with resistance, and tries to prevent a sudden fracture of the therapeutic alliance, by pre-empting acting out.</p>
<p>The reparenting contract is a unique feature of this therapeutic community. It sets up a specific form of intense individual therapeutic relationship which is contained, nurtured and governed by the community which surrounds it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Confrontation </strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, every member of the community has a confrontation contract, and it is important that staff are included in this. It is based on a principle that everyone sometimes behaves in a way that is uncomfortable for others and that everybody can do something about it. Confrontations provide one part of a reactive environment which supports people in understanding their behaviour and their effect on others and helps them to make changes where necessary.</p>
<p>In their pasts, most residents behaved bizarrely and inappropriately, and as a result other people would step back. Residents were aware of the fact that they would end up lonely but did not understand that their behaviour was the reason for it. In the community people are confronted immediately if they act in a way that leaves others feeling uncomfortable or angry. They are told what it is they do that invites others to step back, and what they could do instead. It is a principle that nobody will be rejected for inappropriate behaviour, even though the whole group might be angry with the person. This is important so that residents feel safe in looking at a behaviour or problem, and then work to change or solve it.</p>
<p>Confrontations occur in formal groups or in adhoc “daily life” situations. There is an expectation that people in the immediate vicinity will give priority to confrontational situations and offer peer support. If a situation starts to become increasingly escalative an option would be to call a more formal “structure meeting” at which the whole community is expected to attend. This is a way to counteract a general tendency to withdraw and minimize the significance of acting out or disruptive behaviour.</p>
<p>Confrontations are difficult and uncomfortable. Even though everybody contracts to respond appropriately, there are situations where the confronted person does not agree with the point under discussion. In this situation extra residents and staff are asked to join in and provide a “consensual reality”. Sometimes it is agreed the confronter himself has acted out a problem. However more often it is the confronted person who wants to defend against the point under discussion and reacts angrily or competitively. This person would be expected to ask every member of the group for their perception of the situation and then to accept the group definition.</p>
<p>Confrontations also help to prevent escalations, for even if a resident displays a problem on a low level it will usually be picked up. The emotional charge of the confrontation is usually higher than the acting out was, and that gives the resident the necessary reassurance that he or she was noticed and therefore does not need to act out on a higher level in order to let people know that he needs help.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/0010.jpg" alt="image" />
			<figcaption>Figure G</figcaption>
			</figure>
<p>In practice we find a clear link between Parent values and definitions of reality, for example;</p>
<p>“What you said was nasty”</p>
<p>“But I was just expressing an opinion”</p>
<p>This is illustrated in Fig G as a crossed transaction (noncommunication) arising in a confrontation from Parent to child, with the confronted person declining the invitation to respond from child, and instead competing for a definition of reality from his own Parent. This always leads to a conflict between two different sets of values and is resolved either by recourse to the consensual reality or within a contract in which an individual has already agreed to give way to a new set of Parent values and definitions. Justification for this on a common sense level is that one set of definitions work and the other doesn’t.</p>
<p>Where residents have a parenting contract with a specific member of staff it seems to be therapeutically valuable for that resident to be “claimed” by the parent. Many staff dynamics meetings focus on issues about what might be called “parental sovereignty rights”, and the extent to which parental authority has to be surrendered to the community consensus.</p>
<p>It is interesting that this seems to be a mirror image of society more generally, where we recognize a constant tension between the demands of the state and the rights of parents in relation to children. This supports an explanation for some serious disturbance in the isolation and secrecy of closed family systems, where absolute sovereignty is assumed by parents, with no mediation from alternative sets of values from outside.</p>
<p><strong>1. Resistance and the “non-contract” </strong></p>
<p>It is a common feature in psychotherapy that clients reach an impasse during the process. At different times most residents of this community respond to such an impasse by breaking their therapy contract. For example, they might run off or act out in order to avoid the problem they have come up against and this is recognized by the community as a pattern of avoidance or resistance which is an integral part of the general healing process.</p>
<p>In its development, the community sought a way to hold somebody within its safe boundaries even when this person himself stepped outside the community by breaking the contract, and to address this issue a “non-contract” was developed. This is a contract specifically about what to do when the general communal contract is broken.</p>
<p>All residents experience periods of severe confusion when they are out of touch with reality. However, these periods are not acute all the time, and it is during a time when they are calm and clear thinking that they are expected to design their own “non-contract”, which has to be accepted by the whole community. It includes a clear structured procedure of what to do in a situation when the individual starts to break the therapy contract and does not respond to others. While the person is “clear” he makes the commitment to follow the agreed procedure strictly and rigidly. The aim of this contract is to help the person to calm down, to start thinking clearly again and to make a plan about how to solve the underlying problem. The procedure is generally very effective and most residents use it constructively. The residents who design their own contracts tend to ensure that they are individually suitable. Simplicity and ease of recall are the keys to a successful “non-contract”. For example, residents might agree, on being challenged about the seriousness of their behaviour and that they are currently breaking their contract, to sit down, count breaths and ask for, say, fifteen minutes “time out” to think and resume rational discussion. The agreement would be that the resident must take full responsibility for implementing the steps of the procedure on being confronted. Incapacitation is avoided by having some legitimate recourse in moments of panic and high drama.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reparenting </strong></p>
<p>Most residents report experiences of feeling “little” and “needy” and searching for a parent to look after them. They do not have a set of values and skills to make the world work for them so they are also looking for somebody to orient with and to rely on. One of the underlying beliefs of the community is that this level of regressiveness is a direct result of unmet needs from childhood and it was through a failure to have these needs satisfied that emotional development was disturbed. The communal belief is that a person will grow emotionally once these dependency needs are met. The community recognizes these as “little needs” and members of staff or volunteers, may take on the role of a parent by contract.</p>
<p>Members of the community display varying degrees of disturbance in their attachment patterns, and it is the job of a parent to facilitate a secure attachment within a protective relationship.</p>
<p>When people are dealing with high levels of personal distress, a parenting contract helps to “hold” a person long enough for genuine resolution.</p>
<p>Some people see a particular member of staff as a parent and ask this person to be their “Mum” or “Dad”. This will be openly discussed and if the staff member sees this resident as their child, they might decide to make a parenting contract. The clear expectation from the parent to the son or daughter is to use this relationship to grow and to get “well”. The ultimate goal is to have an independent and healthy life as a grown-up. As in a healthy family (where the children grow up and move on) the residents in this community grow to their full potential, move out and keep in touch if they choose to.</p>
<p>By making the parenting contract the son or daughter asks the parent to be in charge. The parent gives a new set of values and definitions of how to relate to others and how to deal with situations healthily. For most residents it is important to have one main person with whom they clearly belong and where they experience having a solid home base. Even though the parent looks after the “little needs” of their son or daughter, they still expect them to take adult responsibilities in every day life.</p>
<p>Spontaneous regression is discouraged in favour of Adult to Adult agreements. This recognizes the existence of regressive needs and tendencies, and makes possible a healthy exploration of what the regressiveness might mean. It seems to be possible for residents to hold together coherent adult functioning within the boundaries of the community even though outside they might be more obviously and visibly disturbed.</p>
<p>Parenting contracts are not role plays or “for pretend”. A parent only agrees to such a contract if he or she really sees the other person as their child. In their past most residents have experienced being looked after from a guilty position, and experienced that they were resented and unwanted by their natural parents. If a member of staff were to make a parenting contract because it might be therapeutically important, but without really wanting it, the negative experience from the past could be reinforced and compounded. There is no commitment by residents or staff in the Community that makes parenting contracts obligatory. It does seem to be crucial, however, for residents to make at least one firm, healthy attachment to either a staff member or volunteer as a solid basis for change. This would perhaps, in other forms of therapy, be known more simply as a “therapeutic alliance” but in this environment takes on an extra dimension in terms of time and intensity, and the needs of residents.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion </strong></p>
<p>Although it has developed with very little contact with the mainstream therapeutic community movement, the work done at Trident with transactional analysis has “reinvented the wheel” in many of the concepts that are fundamental to constructing a milieu that facilitates personal change and emotional growth. Concepts which were described by Tom Main and Maxwell Jones reappear in a different language, and many of the principles are recognizably similar to individual psycho dynamic or group analytic ones. Here there is only scope to highlight a few areas where this confluence of ideas is most apparent.</p>
<p>In Main’s “Knowledge, Learning and Freedom of Thought”, he clearly warns against a system in which rules become hierarchically promoted to superego functions, and handed on from generation to generation without being considered or evaluated. They become fossilized, fetishized and distorted – and have persecutor rather than therapeutic power. His antidote to such destructive procedures is to maintain a culture of enquiry, in which rules and structures are always open to scrutiny and change. This has clear parallels with the way in which rules and structures in the community described here are variably flexible ( depending on the vigour with which the underlying value is held) and tend to evolve over time in response to a continual and dynamic evaluation by the whole community. Suitable levels of supervision training and external relatedness are also crucial in keeping a culture of enquiry alive and flourishing.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle of Jones is that of the “living-learning experience” and this can also be clearly demonstrated in this community. Every resident has significant problems in building up trusting and close relationships or in holding them. The main emphasis within the community is put on a healthy way of living together and most of the therapy is about the daily interactions between people. Residents demonstrate their problems often in the way they relate to others. Problems will be worked on as they come up. An important goal is to learn the skill to be open, honest and defined with others. To this end material from all the fragments of daily activity can be used, and the structures described (for example, feelings checks or confrontations) can facilitate the use of any of the day to day business of getting on with life in the service of emotional growth.</p>
<p>In group analysis, Foulkes clearly underlines the importance of a shared web of communication in the formation of a “matrix” in which symptoms dissolve once clearly articulated and deeply understood. An essential part of this process is the concept that, collectively, the group constitutes the very norm from which the individuals deviate – and the tendency is for the group to assimilate each other’s positive attributes as well as diminishing the negative ones. This is part of the theoretical underpinning of “democratization” in therapeutic communities, and the community described here incorporates these principles in its structure. Specific examples include the facilitated way in which the feelings behind resistance and acting out are openly communicated and not punished, and how staff and residents alike are bound together in their commitment to the confrontation contract.</p>
<p>Winnicott and Kohut are the two psychoanalysts whose work seems most relevant to this community: Winnicott for his concept of a facilitating environment in which regression is encouraged, and the developing ego receives nurturance in a transitional space: Kohut for his technique of meeting the emotional needs for stable core self development through mirroring, idealization and twin-ship activities in the transference.</p>
<p>Up to this point, much is in common with psychotherapeutic orthodoxy; it is in the detail of the reparenting relationship that something quite novel is attempted. For here, the “as if” nature of the transference is deliberately abolished, and the attempt is made to transplant a whole new set of object relations into willing and contracted recipients. This is not done suddenly, by coercion or in a way that could be construed as abusive, but through the development of an intense individual therapeutic relationship in which primary experience, transference and everyday life sit alongside each other without authoritative interpretation.</p>
<p>What makes this community so interesting is that the individual work could not be done safely without the surrounding framework and matrix of the community, and the community by itself would probably be unable to contain the level of disturbance, distress and neediness of these residents without the intensive individual secure attachments.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Paper on Somatopsychic Approaches for the Rehabilitation of Schizophrenics </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> would like first of all to comment on the term “somatopsychic” used in the title of this paper. In order to make a distinction away from the word “psychosomatic” which has become so much used today in a seeming pejorative sense I have reversed the word in order to bring attention on a different aspect of the mind body process. The word psychosomatic has the connotation of a condition that is negative, of a process taking place within the person that the switch in the word I wish to here refer to a process which is positive. The process is based on body awareness and attention with a resultant change in the psyche of the person. Through the process which is stimulated in the body there is a corresponding opening and healing activity within the psyche or mind.</p>
<p>We are all aware of how the emotions and thinking processes accompanying the emotions have an effect on the mind. Also our attitudes have an effect on our emotions. And the emotions may have a serious effect on the body causing health problems – what we refer to as psychosomatic illness. Some would say today that all physical illness has a psychosomatic component.</p>
<p>In considering these Somatopsychic approaches we are viewing the energy flow in the opposite direction. The person goes through some bodily process or stimulation which in turn causes an emotional reaction which can then be traced to an attitude or belief system which causes the negative feelings or distress the person is experiencing. He may not be conscious of the negative feelings or conscious of the attitudes or beliefs causing them to be experienced. A change in the attitudes or belief system can then be attained for an alleviation of the distress and a move made to build up a positive and more meaningful system, a system that brings about a healing in the personality.</p>
<p>In this paper I will be referring to many different Somatopsychic processes which we have found beneficial to patients. There are the different forms of yoga exercises – the breathing exercises the yoga cyclic meditation exercises, the asanas – then what we call evolutionary exercises, delacato exercises, psycho-physical exercises, dance therapy, swimming, rage reduction procedures, theatre sessions, multi-tracking sessions.</p>
<p>I will briefly go through each of the above exercises explaining what is included in each of them and our experience in using them with patients.</p>
<p><strong>Yoga : </strong></p>
<p>There is really no need to describe what the yoga exercises are. However, it is important to bring out the difficulties that there are in having persons with serious mental problems doing these exercises. It has become evident that any degree of pathology may hinder a person in doing these physical yoga exercises. We began the yoga sessions under the direction of Dr. Shirley Tellis of the Vivekananda Yoga Centre. The centre will be presenting their research findings on this project in another paper at this conference.</p>
<p>I have been engaged with our patients for over a year and a half in the morning sessions four or five days a week and have personal experience of how the patients do the exercises and the benefits they have gained and also their problems. We have an hour and a quarter sessions in the morning which is spent on breathing exercises and then simple asanas. In the late afternoon there is another forty-five minute session called cyclic meditation which consists in doing some concentrated slow movements and asanas. We use a tape of Dr. Shirley directing the sessions however myself or one of the staff must be present as a leader to see that the exercises are done properly.</p>
<p>Some patients enjoy doing the exercises and would continue on their own even if it were not compulsory. Some others would stop if they were not required to do them. I believe that the two main problems which are there for those who have difficulty is the inability to concentrate on their body and the lack of a quick, easy good sense of their body. To just move the body without any awareness of what you are doing, without paying attention to the sensations that are in the arm or leg as it is moved or stretched is of no benefit to the person. The mind and body have to be both active at the same time. Some find it almost impossible to remain with their hands by their sides while going through a prolonged relaxation exercise. They will move their hands to their chest or scratch their face or put them behind their head. It took a very long time to have them stay adequately quiet without moving during the simple relaxation exercises and yet there is great benefit in the relaxation. Some who have the tendency to constantly talk to themselves have been helped by the attention they have been required to give the relaxation.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the yoga exercises is the breathing. Again many of the more seriously disturbed have great difficulty with deep breathing and often have reverse breathing, that is, their abdomen will be sucked in when they are inhaling and pushed out when they are exhaling. It is difficult to have them change this pattern. Many will be breathing into their upper chest only and raising their shoulders as they try to inhale. This is indication of the degree of discrepancy which exists within their body mind patterns. Hence there is a discovery of the unconscious confusion existing that has been a block to their functioning easily and in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>The cyclic meditation when done well will at times bring up disturbing thoughts and memories. The person will sense bodily sensations that are disturbing and often may result in strong feelings such as anger or fear.</p>
<p>When there is difficulty in moving the body in an easy manner for example, when a person is unable to raise his leg in a straight manner after months and months of practice it gives us an indication of the problem that person has not been paying attention to the reality situation of his or her life. If they do not have control over their body they do not have control over their thinking process nor can they clearly understand themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Dance Therapy : </strong></p>
<p>The dance therapy also deals with the ability to move one’s body in the manner in which you plan to move it. This is linked with the sense of freedom, the willingness to be open and to let go of the tight control of one’s thinking and attitudes. The free body movement involved in the dance requires that the person have an acceptance of self. In the therapy session the various exercises can be used to bring out a sense of boundaries and space both of which can help the person to consider these concepts in their relationships with other persons. Through constant practice and outside pressure the person can be brought to look at the rigidity which may be in their thinking and feeling. The fear that is the basis of the rigidity can be brought into consciousness and talked about and worked. Most important in this therapy is that feedback sessions after the practice used to bring about self awareness and hopefully inner change. This inner change can be tried out in the body movements deliberately so the internal changes can be reinforced.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming : </strong></p>
<p>We have found swimming an excellent form of having patients come into awareness of their body movement. Some of them have been swimming twice a week. Those that go swimming enjoy it very much. Some have learned to swim after joining the community. Again there is the sense of risk and freedom in the willingness to float, to be aware of body movements, to trust in oneself, plus the sense of touch with water that gives the person openness to a present reality in which they are immersed.</p>
<p><strong>Delacato Exercises : </strong></p>
<p>Moshe Feldenkrais has observed and analysed the developmental stages of movements in infants. From this, he has proposed that the development and integration of older with newer parts of the brain might be dependent upon the child’s being able to recapitulate within the first three years of life, the critical movements of phylogenetic development<strong>. </strong>If the developing human fails to go through these critical movements this results in damage to body and behaviour and normal functioning.</p>
<p>Doman-Delacato (The Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential) while working with children who had reading disabilities, learning disabilities, brain damage and difficulties in psychomotor co-ordination, made interesting observations. They hypothesized, based on their experience, that brain development was the result of psychomotor functions and performance rather than the reverse.</p>
<p>Temple Fay, a famous neuro surgeon, saw the stages which man’s brain went through (fish, amphibian, reptile to mammal) as guide posts to developmental task, he could be repatterned, i.e., physically manipulated to go through the movement that was missed. If a child was patterned for a month, perhaps his brain could learn how it feels to go through that particular movement. When he learns this movement, this learning would have to go through existing but unused channels of the brain, or it might create new channels. Doman-Delacato proved through their experience that this theory was true. The brain can be stimulated to develop through psychomotor activities.</p>
<p>Severely emotionally disturbed individuals demonstrate similar neurological and learning difficulties. Remedial measures used with children have been helpful with emotionally disturbed adults. We have experienced some of our patients benefiting from the patterning and also from the creeping and crawling exercises. Evaluation of individuals for neurological problems can be done through detailed history taking and analyzing eyedness, handedness, sleeping postures, sidedness, leggedness etc.</p>
<p>The remedial measures we have used are the neurological exercises. The diagnosis of the problem indicates the stage or stages of development that the person needs to return to and go through. The following are some of the exercises prescribed at different stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-6 months….. rocking on the stomach, startling, crawling, eye exercises and ear exercises; </li>
<li>6-9 months…… creeping, crawling, eye and ear exercises, soft and hard stimulation, imitating the movements of the monkey, the ape Neanderthal man; </li>
<li>9-16 months….. cross-lateral walk, throwing and catching a ball for eye-hand coordination, kicking a football, running, hopping, skipping and other exercises which involve higher cortical functioning. </li>
</ul>
<p>It has been our observation that while doing these exercises patients experience a wide range of emotions which can be addressed in therapy. This is an important help in the process of a healthy handling of emotions and a healthy integration of body and mind.</p>
<p><strong>Psycho-Physical Exercises : </strong></p>
<p>Each one of us speaks, moves, thinks and feels in a different manner, each according to the image of himself that he or she has built up over the years. This we refer to as the self-image. This self-image includes and is partly built from the body-image.</p>
<p>Interrelatedness of movement, sensing, thinking, feeling functions are how body and mind interact and determine what we are and what we can do. Problems arise when the experience of the body is more or less distorted so that when you act according to this distorted experience of your body, there will be a disconcerting discrepancy. This discrepancy will be evident between what you intend to do and think you are doing on the one hand and what you are actually doing on the other hand.</p>
<p>For any lasting change to occur there necessarily needs to be a change in the self-image. For this to happen there has to be a new awareness. With severely disturbed individuals there is a gross lack of conscious awareness of both the body image as well as the self-image. Furthermore, the perceptions of bodily sensations are often distorted and the perception of reality may also be coloured.</p>
<p>The psycho-physical re-education exercises work with body and mind together to improve specific and overall functioning and bring the person closer to his or her potential. A great many diverse, gentle movements are evoked with attention always being drawn to the movements and the accompanying sensations. As the person learns, with a minimum effort, to pay attention to his body, he will find that his body will become more accessible to his mind, and as this happens, it will function better. He will learn that the body can function optimally when indeed there is an awareness, and he will discover the extent to which the awareness was lacking.</p>
<p>Not only are awareness and the ability to move and sense are enhanced, but also the cognitive and feeling functions improve also, for the extensive changes in the brain’s motor cortex which must precede changes in the muscular system affect adjacent brain areas as well. Feldenkrais states – “owing to the close proximity of the motor cortex of the brain structures dealing with thought and feeling, and the tendency of the processes in the brain tissue to diffuse and spread to neighbouring tissues, a drastic change in the motor cortex will have parallel effects on thinking and feeling”.</p>
<p>The body image acquires its gaps, its areas of vagueness, and its distortions in various ways. Parts of the body and the interconnections between them fade from the image when they are not used. A schizophrenic may lose his bodily sensations just as completely as if nerves were deadened. Psychophysical exercises bring into awareness those parts of the body which are not sensed or which are sensed only dimly. They also eliminate distortions from the body image. It helps in making use of formerly unused or little used neural pathways. Psychophysical re-education is a neural re-education which makes the nervous system more responsive and amenable to change. Psychophysical exercises (P.E.) cause effective communication to the brain, specifying bodily changes which the brain can and will effect in response to the appropriate stimulus.</p>
<p>The primary objective of PE is freedom. It consists of many methods and techniques to inform the person of certain facts about herself and the ways in which she can change if she wishes</p>
<p>F.M. Alexander, founder of the Alexander Technique, said misuse of the body often begins in that region where the neck joins the body and he regarded this area as the “use area”. When the condition of this part of the body is improved, it becomes easier to bring about improvement in other areas. The first two PE work in this area. Muscular tensions in the back and neck will be eliminated in the first exercise, as well as some tension in the eye muscle.</p>
<p>The second PE also improves the primary areas of misuse. By markedly reducing the excess tensions in muscles of the back, it will enable the shoulder joints to move with more freedom and allow the head and neck to move better.</p>
<p>The third PE helps in the reduction of tension in the back muscles and helps in aligning the spine. The exercise also helps to free the lower back.</p>
<p>The fourth PE helps in relaxing the hip and pelvis areas. These exercises help in the awareness and acceptance of a one’s sexuality and the problems connected with sexuality.</p>
<p>Bodily movements are taught in a manner that increases and enables the person to be more aware of her complete self. In the PE sessions patients have become aware of deep strong feelings and spoken about memories of the past that need to be resolved for them to establish a healthy strong self-image that can cope with the pressures they experience within their personalities at present.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Reduction : </strong></p>
<p>When a patient becomes aware that he has deep strong feelings of anger that have been generated from past happenings in life they can be given an opportunity to express those feelings in a safe supportive situation and thus be rid of them. It is essential that they make a decision to be free of them in the process. They can be held down or restrained in such a manner that they can forcibly move their body in any way they feel inclined to without hurting themselves or another person.</p>
<p>The severely disturbed are unable to go through such a procedure because they are usually not aware of the anger they hold within their bodies or not willing to take responsibility for that feeling. So they act it out in other ways. When they see other patients going through such procedures they learn that there are proper ways of expressing anger and making changes.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Tracking : </strong></p>
<p>The seriously disturbed patients often seem to be locked into single idea, obsession, attitude or belief, or feeling and are unable to entertain freely a variety of thoughts, perceptions or feelings. They seem to be set on one track, as we say a onetrack- mind, not shifting easily from one thought or perception to another and not able to keep a number of thoughts and options open at the same time.</p>
<p>The multi-tracking consists in keeping many different parts of a process in mind while undergoing varied stimulation coming though distinctively different motor functions, with thoughts, sounds, rhythms all coming to the individual at once. Hopefully, what the individual is learning in the process is flexibility and an openness to make changes in attitudes and thinking. In this way the person can develop a level of freedom within the self.</p>
<p><strong>Theatre Exercises : </strong></p>
<p>These exercises consist in having the patients perform as players in an acting situation. They are called to articulate their body and speak in the role, depicting behaviour or the personality of another person. They will at times need to work out with others how they are going to interpret a real life situation or an imaginary skit. Mimicking, silently or verbally interpreting a short poem, through action describing a situation are all profitable theatrical activities.</p>
<p>How they handle the process of acting and interpreting gives valuable information on issues that will need to be dealt with in other therapy sessions.</p>
<p>Again the goal is to bring the patient to an awareness of bodily movement, of expression of feelings and attitudes, and an ability to choose different ways of expressing emotions. This enables the patient to more easily recognize and accept whatever emotions they are experiencing within themselves. They can learn that they can have inner freedom even though they have certain emotions which seem to dominate them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion : </strong></p>
<p>The many different exercises that have been outlined here have been beneficial to our patients in many varied way. Much is spoken about talk therapy which can become a sort of trap to both the patient and therapist as for example, eliciting memories of the past to obtain some form of resolution to healthy functioning. By working with the bodily expressions which lead to a stimulation of new thinking and appropriate feelings in the here and now we find that patients experience themselves differently and begin to realize that they can live rewarding and happy lives.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Shifting…Differentiation.... Awareness… Consciousness…. </h2>
<p><strong>A Few Important Words </strong></p>
<p><span class="big-letter">L</span>iving in a therapeutic community with twenty-five young adults who can be at times seriously disturbed has given me many opportunities to experience the shifts that people make within their personalities. These are not the usual simple shifts between ego states, say from Parent to Child. Nor am I referring to the phenomenon of unconsciously “shifting feelings”. I am referring to what may be considered shifts of the seat of consciousness or of the self. May be they could be fitted into an ego state theory. Maybe they could give us indications about how we can enlarge or further ego state theory.</p>
<p>I will be talking from my experience with schizophrenics and persons who have come to me for consultation in therapy and counseling sessions. I believe that the same internal process in various degrees takes place in all of us since all of us have feelings and rational thinking patterns. Although often what happens is not so much a process as an instantaneous happening we do not seem to recognize or control at the time.</p>
<p>Let me start with a couple of stories I have read about lately. There was an older woman in Canada who was talking with her estranged husband one morning in her kitchen. There was no one else in the house. He told her he was finally deciding on a divorce. At the end of the conversation she told him to leave through the kitchen door leading into the closed garage. As he went into the garage she shot him six times. He was severely wounded and as he lay on the garage floor negotiated with her to call an ambulance or the police. Finally she agreed. He recovered and she was charged with attempted murder. The court under psychiatric advice freed her of responsibility. The shock of his asking for a divorce caused her to shift her consciousness into a panic state of fear and anger. Her rational awareness evaporated. Her rational awareness was no longer differentiated from the overpowering feelings she experienced.</p>
<p>Daniel Goleman in his book Emotional Intelligence recounts the story of a very ambitious high school boy who believed he wasn’t given high enough grades in his papers, with the result that he would not be accepted by the prestigious medical college of his choice. The boy subsequently attacked and wounded the teacher with a knife. He also was not charged with any misdemeanor on the testimony of four psychologists. His normal reasoned behaviour was lost in the fear and anger of future disappointment.</p>
<p>In both cases there was a shift of awareness or consciousness from reasoning and knowing what is appropriate to being overwhelmed by the strong feelings which arose at the moment.</p>
<p>One of our patients, a strongly built young man of 25, was with us in our therapeutic community for about four years. He was a fairly quiet person stubborn and unwilling to adapt, agreeable to discuss his problems only with myself and another staff member. We advised and pushed him to be open yet he remained always very guarded, with a bit of bull-headedness backed by a firm self-will. He usually managed to do nothing outwardly wrong, yet tested limits many times. His belief was that he was perfectly healthy and normal – yet the psychological testing showed him to be one of the most seriously disturbed in the community. He refused to believe that any psychotropic medication would help him.</p>
<p>On one evening he shifted and lost his guarded control. Another patient was upset and threatened a staff member. This first fellow immediately sprang on the other in such a manner that he could have seriously hurt him. In discussions afterward he claimed amnesis of what he had done. Yet with further questioning he could recall and admitted that he believed he had to protect himself from this fellow and intended to do the worst. In the process of his attack he had lost all contact with others. That is what I mean by a shift. There was no differentiation of thinking from feeling, no differentiation of self from others. He couldn’t hear others because in his conscious awareness they were no longer there. He was lost in his feelings of fear and anger. There was also no differentiation of the self from the feelings which were being experienced and expressed, no differentiation between the feeling that was driving him and his normally controlling and reasoning self.</p>
<p>In such a process the person seems to lose all freedom. He or she gives themselves up to the feeling drive that comes up to take control of them so they lose awareness of their thinking and caring for self or others. Another patient has said that in her process – not a violent process but a psychotic one – it was as if she was being controlled by an outside force. She experienced her conscious self as being powerless and ineffectual to break out of the process and use her reasoning power. Fortunately she has been very consciously attached to me in the past so she would acknowledge my voice when I spoke firmly and decisively with her – not attempting to reason with her. I could imagine her to be going through a marshy swamp slipping and sliding yet finding some solid footing from time to time through my definitions. Her own definitions were not available for her. The internal differentiation must be there if the person is to be aware and use their appropriate definitions of reality which they normally use to guide their relations and behaviour.</p>
<p>What takes place within the personality when such happenings occur? By studying some theories on the development of human consciousness and the beginnings of schizophrenia in the human personality I have been able to gain some understanding of this problem of shifting which we make in our consciousness when we are disturbed by high levels of feelings or emotions. Giving attention to theories on the development of consciousness in the young infant can provide some insight into this shifting. I believe it is easiest if I just quote from some of my readings.</p>
<p>First there is the theory proposed by Margaret Mahler. For her the infant from 1-5 months is in the symbiotic phase which is “a state of undifferentiation, of fusion with the mother, in which the ‘I’ is not yet differentiated from the ‘not-I’ and in which inside and outside are only gradually coming to be sensed as different.” In the next stage, from 5-9 months the infant’s sensoriphysical body self “hatches”. “There are definite signs that the infant begins to differentiate his own body from the mother’s body”, a sentence of Margaret Mahler quoted by Ken Wilber in his book Transformations of Consciousness, p.86.</p>
<p>“Notice that this particular differentiation is basically of the sensoriphysical body self from its surroundings, because the infant’s mind (the newly emerging phatasmic or image level) and its feelings (the emotional-sexual level) are not yet differentiated from their surroundings. The infant exists as a distinct sensoriphysical body self but not as a distinct phantasmic-emotional self, because it’s emotional-self images and emotional object-images are still fused or merged.”</p>
<p>In the next stage from 9-15 months Mahler says “libidinal Cathexis shifts substantially into the service of the rapidly growing autonomous ego and its functions, and the child seems intoxicated with his own faculties and with the greatness of the world. Narcissism is at its peak.”</p>
<p>Ken Wilber would say that self and object representations are still a fused unit. Object representation might be loosely defined as an image of the person, here the infant, has of the outside.</p>
<p>Mahler says that the stage from 15-24 months is crucial to development. With the differentiation of self and object representations a separate and distinct phantasmic emotional self has emerged. I would put it that now the infant in some way realizes it has feelings, becomes conscious or aware that it has feelings. It can also have an image of a thing outside of itself. As Piaget says, it can remember that the ball is put behind the door. That is the important aspect to be noticed; the infant is conscious it has feelings and images. And these feelings cause it to realize that it is no longer master of the world, it “must gradually and painfully give up the delusion of its own grandeur.” Think of how the two year old has to learn to adapt. In the next year the infant usually comes to “clear and relatively enduring differentiation of self and object representations”.</p>
<p>In the first year of life the infant learns to differentiate its physical self from the physical environment and so a sense of being a distinct physical self emerges. If this does not happen, the infant remains “stuck” in a state where inside and outside are fused, hallucinatory thought processes recur and severe anxiety and depression result the person is open to psychosis. Somewhere between 18-24 months the infant learns to differentiate its emotional-psychological life from that of others and a stable individual emotional self emerges. With this individuation-separation there is a separate self. If this does not happen then it is as if there is not skin separating the self from the world with the result that anxiety, depression and severe thought disturbances occur – the person could be considered borderline being open to problems that tend at times to psychosis and neurosis. In the years from three to six the child learns to have a mental self – learns to think besides just feel. It also learns that some feelings are acceptable and some not, some may need to be repressed at the time, and the appropriateness of expression of feelings has to be considered. If the repression is too strong and enduring or the expression of feelings is done through inappropriate behaviours there can arise the different neurotic behaviours.</p>
<p>And now to come back to the idea of shifting of awareness or consciousness. I believe that simply put we may say that because of the level or intensity of the feelings whatever differentiation and separation that is within us to help us function as reasonable feeling creatures seems to fall away. The feelings being the more primitive within our evolutionary history and stronger ,they may become predominant and the reasoning and thinking power gives way. It is very difficult to get a person in a major escalation of feelings to listen to reason or pay attention to another’s voice as they would be open to in other circumstances. How difficult it is to get a person being carried away by feelings to listen to the arguments you may put forth to him or her. Their consciousness has shifted from the thinking to the very strong feelings they experience.</p>
<p>As far as ego state theory goes I believe we are talking about the development of the very primitive child ego state referred to in TA language usually as Co – the very beginning of conscious awareness.. Schizophrenia being a regressive disease the person shifts right back to Co or Cl, letting go of any A2 or P2. And we all do it in some degree when we weaken our conscious awareness away from what we think best or have decided or believe proper and beneficial for us. Or we may play games when we give into and allow inappropriate feelings lead us – not being consciously aware that the feelings we are acting out on now may not be appropriate to this situation or helpful to us.</p>
<p>Of interest in this question of shifting feelings in what Daniel Goleman writes in his book ‘Emotional Intelligence’. He mentions the latest studies on the evolution of the human brain – how the early brain is the base of the emotions and responds most quickly and strongly and often without reference to the neoecortex where our thinking and problem solving occurs. I quote from Goleman – “Anatomically the emotional system can act independently of the neocortex. Some emotional reactions and emotional memories can be formed without any conscious, cognitive participation at all. The amygdala can house memories and response repertoires that we enact without quite realizing why we do so because the shortcut from thalamus to amygdale completely bypasses the neocortex. This bypass seems to allow the amygdala to be a repository for emotionala impressions and memories we have never known about in full awareness.”</p>
<p>So, the goal in our lives if we are to control this tendency or the possibility of this shifting within our personalities, it would seem we need to be in awareness or full consciousness of our feelings and emotions and thinking.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Blocks to Thinking </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>e, all of us, use certain actions that are external, that is, can be seen and noticed and also internal to ourselves, that is thoughts, decisions in order to avoid an autonomous response to stimuli, problems, options that we are aware of, that come in our way.</p>
<p>Being autonomous I respond freely and consciously in the present situation to reach whatever I am needing at the time. I am able to use myself to the best of my ability, and clearly act.</p>
<p>Why is it that so many people really do nothing about getting what they want in their lives, or in certain situations?</p>
<p>We believe in our work in a process that people use – use unconsciously – that stops them from acknowledging or minimizing or fully ignoring something. What they ignore or minimize is some aspect of themselves, something about themselves, some aspect of other people or the real situation which they are involved in.</p>
<p>The technical word we use is discounting. For example, I wish to do very well in an examination for my degree and yet am convinced I must keep spending a great deal of time working on a story that I believe will be accepted by a publisher. I am not aware that my efforts are being divided. I am in fact doing nothing about my desire to do well in the examination. I can be very busy at any task, and yet that may not be the task that is needed to achieve what I want to achieve.</p>
<p>My thinking must be clearly and autonomously directed to the goal I really want for myself. I may say I want this, but really in fact do nothing worthwhile to reach it.</p>
<p>I have to become aware of this discounting. Most of us discount in some way or other. This is especially true where people do not accept or see the options, which are open to them. To be creative means to have the whole field open to me. I am going to bring forth that wasn’t there before. I may be discounting the stimulus, the breakthrough that will lead to the solution of a problem.</p>
<p>So, if I am to be creative I must be aware of the existence of what stimuli I am experiencing, what problems I have to face, what options I have before me, for I always have options before me.</p>
<p>What problem is facing me or before me, what am I trying to solve?</p>
<p>Then I have to be aware of the importance of this problem. How important is it in my life, what is the significance? I may minimize how important it is for me to solve this problem. How relevant is this problem to my present situation?</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the importance I will put my strongest effort into it. If I do not realize that I am going to lose my job if I do not make a greater effort to make sales, I may not put my best effort into increasing my sales. Some people float along in a way taking it for granted that this is not a serious problem.</p>
<p>Notice the fellow on the motorbike darting in and out of traffic without a helmet. He is discounting the value of his own life. He may be a computer whiz but his thinking is not very creative. You would have to ask him why he is discounting at such a level.</p>
<p>Then we have to aware, have to admit that in any situation there are possibilities for change. Will the fellow admit that his opinion that you cannot get through traffic without whizzing through is open to question? That there is a creative solution if he would take time to be open to options, believing there are options if he would look for them. That there are viable options always.</p>
<p>Or he might say that the others could make a change, could solve the problem, but we could never expect him to change; it is just not him, the person who he is, to react differently in the traffic situation. Nor can we expect him to work on solving the problem, he is just not the type to do that sort of a thing. Nor could we expect him to accept the options that could be discovered in the situation.</p>
<p>We would have to manage to get him believe that he does have the personal ability to react differently, to solve problems, and act on his options.</p>
<p>Then we could go further with him and have him admit, that yes, usually problems can be solved if we take seriously the importance of the options, the choices before us and consider what they are. Then he might accept that it would be worth acting on those options.</p>
<p>But all the discounting which he is doing is outside of his awareness. And so, it will impair his effective thinking.</p>
<p>In all of this there will be involved some sort of exaggeration. It could be “you can’t expect me to change, that is impossible for me? My friends would make a fool of me if I slowed down”.</p>
<p>We started talking about doing nothing about the problem, that is nothing effective is done to solve the real problem that is there.</p>
<p>But, there are other behaviors which people might engage in when they are not ready to consciously face up to what is blocking their thinking, blocking their feeling well about themselves.</p>
<p>The person may indulge in agitation, which is a repetitive behavior, that has nothing related to solving the problem that may be bothering them, and they would like to solve. The bother may be in the form of uncomfortable sensations and so the agitation is used to build up energy to avoid the problem. The thinking is often quite confused with a sense that something should be done, yet unwilling to really stop, think, understand, judge, reason and come to a solution.</p>
<p>The agitation is often to limit a stronger reaction that may be brewing deep down. This stronger reaction, for example, may be a great fear of taking a stand on a problem and so working and thinking to create a solution out of the problem. This is a type of reaction that can lead to harming oneself or another. Taking one’s life does not solve the problem that was there. The same avoidance result can be displayed by fainting, getting sick, and having a heart attack.</p>
<p>The person is not using creative thinking to bring himself or herself out of a distressing situation. The person does not realize, is not aware that he or she still has all the capability to solve the problem only if he or she becomes aware of the confusion, begins to understand the situation, understand all that is happening within, make judgments about himself or herself, and find a reasonable solution to the problem which will be of value and bring them to a comfort and peace.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ego Consciousness </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">P</span>sychology therefore culminates of necessity in a developmental process which is peculiar to the psyche and consists in integrating the unconscious contents into consciousness.</p>
<p>This means that the psychic human being becomes a whole, and becoming whole has remarkable effects on egoconsciousness which are extremely difficult to describe.</p>
<p>I doubt my ability to give a proper account of the change that comes over the subject under the influence of the individuation process; it is a relatively rare occurrence which is experienced only by those who have gone through the wearisome but, if the unconscious is to be integrated, indispensable is the business of coming to terms with the unconscious components of the personality.</p>
<p>Once these unconscious components are made conscious, it results not only in their assimilation to the already existing ego-personality, but in a transformation of the latter.</p>
<p>The main difficulty is to describe the manner of this transformation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the ego is a hard-and-fast complex which, because tied to consciousness and its continuity, cannot easily be altered, and should not be altered unless one wants to bring on pathological disturbances.</p>
<p>The closest analogies to an alteration of the ego are to be found in the field of psychopathology, where we meet not only with neurotic dissociations but with the schizophrenic fragmentation, or even dissolution, of the ego.</p>
<p>In this field, too, we can observe pathological attempts at integration, if such an expression be permitted.</p>
<p>These consist in more or less violent eruptions of unconscious contents into consciousness, the ego proving itself incapable of assimilating the intruders.</p>
<p>But if the structure of the ego-complex is strong enough to withstand their assault without having its framework fatally dislocated, then assimilation can take place.</p>
<p>In that event there is an alteration of the ego as well as of the unconscious contents.</p>
<p>Although it is able to preserve its structure, the ego is ousted from its central and dominating position and thus finds itself in the role of a passive observer who lacks the power to assert his will under all circumstances, not so much because it has been weakened in any way, as because certain considerations give it pause.</p>
<p>That is, the ego cannot help discovering that the afflux of unconscious contents has vitalized the personality, enriched it and created a figure that somehow dwarfs the ego in scope and intensity.</p>
<p>This experience paralyzes an over-egocentric will and convinces the ego that in spite of all the difficulties it is better to be taken down a peg than to get involved in a hopeless struggle in which one is invariably handed the dirty end of the stick.</p>
<p>In this way the will, as disposable energy, gradually subordinates itself to the stronger factor, namely to the new totality-figure I call the self.</p>
<p>Naturally, in these circumstances there is the greatest temptation simply to follow the power-instinct and to identify the ego with the self outright, in order to keep up the illusion of the ego’s mastery.</p>
<p>In other cases the ego proves too weak to offer the necessary resistance to the influx of unconscious contents and is thereupon assimilated by the unconscious, which produces a blurring or darkening of ego-consciousness and its identification with a preconscious wholeness.</p>
<p>But these developments make the realization of the self impossible, and at the same time are fatal to the maintenance of ego-consciousness.</p>
<p>They amount, therefore, to pathological effects.</p>
<p>It is abundantly clear that such an abasement du niveau mental</p>
<p>i.e. the overpowering of the ego by unconscious contents and the consequent identification with a preconscious wholeness, possesses a prodigious psychic virulence, or power of contagion and is capable of the most disastrous results.</p>
<p>Developments of this kind should therefore, be watched very carefully; they require the closest control.</p>

 		<h1 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Healing Communities</h1>
 		 <p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he World Health Organisation has been stressing that in the efforts being made to help individuals suffering from mental illness, emphasis must be placed on “community”. Although it is said that mental illness is a family problem many of those in the helping professions believe that it is necessary , because of the scope of the problem today, that the larger community become involved. By the larger community they are referring to the local civic community, all the various institutions in the local civic community to become in some manner involved with the task of providing treatment, care and rehabilitation to young people who may be having serious mental health problems.</p>
<p>Also, the WHO calls for new initiatives to be fostered in the field of helping individuals to overcome the mental health problems that young people in the larger community may be experiencing. These initiatives suggest that those involved in the mental health field perhaps should move away from the traditionally defined roles, to experiment in multi-faceted roles, often with boundaries that are not clearly defined, to show a willingness to share their knowledge and skills, to move away from the often paternalistic nature displayed in their professional role, to forge partnerships with all those willing to dedicate time to working with the mentally ill and to being trained in newly evolving methodologies of treatment that could be of help in bringing the mentally ill back into the main stream of the larger civic community.</p>
<p>All of these ventures could be continually evaluated as to their outcomes and adaptations so that it can be seen which are the most effective.</p>
<p>In this article I would like to talk about the move in some areas to establish half-way homes, that is to bring the mentally ill together in small live-in communities, where they learn to function more effectively in their daily personal lives, where they find the skills to relate competently and efficaciously with people having similar problems and with trained therapists who lead them to stabilize their often chaotic thinking and behavior. These communities are of a very special kind with a very special aim. There are many kinds of communities. A community exists when all the members classified as belonging to the group have a common purpose.</p>
<p>The common aim flows from its character, its purpose. The common aim of a therapeutic community is to do whatever is possible for the promotion of effective therapy for the mental health of all the persons who are connected with the community. The therapeutic community is a body of people sharing common activities and bound by multiple relations. The members of the community start from the belief that the aims of any individual can only be achieved with the active participation of the others in the community. The therapeutic community is different from the usual treatment facility, most notably on the demands that are made on the patient and the overall support that is offered to the patient. Irrespective of help offered by others, the patient must learn to appropriately use his or her own inner consciousness and strength to handle whatever feelings that may arise, to distinguish and separate his feelings from his thinking, and incorporate and operate from a new and more appropriate set of beliefs and values than the negative beliefs and values he or she has been using to guide their interactions with other people. This entire project is based on the belief that each member of the community has the innate power to become mentally well through his or her responsible interactions with others.</p>
<p>All aspects of the life, the vitality, the subsistence of the community are dedicated to foster and assist each and every member of the community to experience a full personal life. This means a life within which relationships of trust, meaningful reciprocal interactions, and responsible independence of thoughts, feelings and values is appreciated and developed. Within the community there are clear and definite healthy structures that have been agreed upon by the members through discussions and reflection on the needs of the individual members. Each member of the community shares the responsibility for the aims of the community and develops his or her mental health through his or her own personal striving to further the shared aims of the community. Therapists teach patients to recognize, develop and use their own strengths and skills instead of simply relying heavily on medication to calm their feelings of anger and fear, or to settle distressing fantasies and thoughts.</p>
<p>The movement of a mentally ill person through the treatment process of the therapeutic community can in a general manner be clearly followed. There are usually stages that the individual will pass through as he or she becomes more functional and aware of the changes within their own consciousness through their sensitive interactions with others in the community.</p>
<p>A new patient entering into the community often is ill at ease in the new surroundings, finding it difficult to fit into the openness and closeness that exists within this new group ambience, an ambience such that he or she has never before experienced. Their life has often been one of withdrawal and silence, misunderstanding and doubt. And yet the mentally ill person, although he or she does not want to own it, needs and wants the security and support that is being offered by this understanding group of people who seem to know each other so well. Slowly he or she will experience, as they watch the members of the community mix and share, that there is something here they would like to move into, even to open into the acceptance that seems to pervade the group. He or she may experience or sense an acceptance by one or other of the therapists. He or she may be surprised as one of the therapists takes the initiative in offering assistance and guidance.</p>
<p>Once the patient has made a connection to a therapist within the community and begins to feel somewhat at ease, he or she will, through their interactions, begin to experience the difference in their thinking and their behavior from that of others in the community. They begin to grow in awareness. With the help of others they start to distinguish the original learning process that took place in their lives and caused the developments in their personality. Reflection and discussion will lead them to become aware of those basic attitudes that have caused them to be so negative and unhappy in their lives. They will begin to evaluate themselves, and decide on changes needed in order to abandon the old negative memories and beliefs. And then they may discover the positive affirmations and beliefs they can form about themselves, about other people and about life in general. All of this leads them to realize that life can have a much fuller meaning than they ever realized.</p>
<p>Once these new values have been adopted they need to be practiced and lived as guiding principles in life with others. The ideal way of integrating these new attitudes and values is by living them within the community, this being what we might call the third stage of treatment in the community. And of course it is not all that simple. Life long attitudes and values are not changed overnight so there will be times when the individual will be confronted for behavior or statements that are indicative of the old past unhealthy lifestyle. The defenses do not fall away easily. Confrontation does play an important role in the therapeutic community, seen as necessary for all members. Usually there is an agreed contract according to which all disagreements and problems are to be solved through discussions. These may last for hours but from these discussions comes a deep sense of responsibility and an empowerment. The empowerment gives the patient an ability to fully state his or her thoughts and opinions, have them challenged or accepted, always with the result that there is agreement and the satisfaction everyone has been recognized and appreciated. The therapeutic community has a strong democratic base that is recognized by all.</p>
<p>As the patient learns to discuss equally with others, he or she acquires the ability to act. The better word for this new living skill is “agency”. All people wish to have the satisfaction of being able to make things happen, to make a difference, at least in their own small way. So if the patient can now direct five or six of other members of the community in cleaning up the pots and pans and dishes after the evening meal, he or she gains a sense of accomplishment. This is the fourth stage of the move through the therapeutic community. The patient’s continual transactions with the staff and other members of the community help to develop the responsibility he or she will need when they move out of the community.</p>
<p>The moving out from the community is the last stage in the community healing process. Now the person becomes no longer the patient but the member of the community who is leaving the community each day to go to his or her workplace. This is an adventurous move, moving into a work place that does not function with all the support and care and interaction that exists within the community. The person may come back home to the community each night, or may experiment with having a place to stay outside the community. If the person is going to return to the family, then sessions will be held with the family so that the family community is functioning in a manner that is helpful to the well-being of all the family members. This, a very important stage, for all the feelings and attitudes of the past years, the unhappy years, will need to be brought on the carpet and be dealt with. All this must be handled with clarity and acceptance. The fears must be solved so that the former patient will find regain a new trust and acceptance. The angers must be resolved so that there is a mutual understanding, a willingness to forgive, and gratitude that each of the family members has found his or her way to peace and strength.</p>
<p>There are many efforts being made to bring those who suffer from mental illness back to well being and happiness. Bringing patients together in small communities of twenty or so can be very effective. Twenty-four people are a sufficient number of people with different personalities, while at the same time relationships will be close so it is totally different from a large, cold, ordered institution. I believe that we change because someone wants us to change, we change because of our relationship to someone else be it God, a parent, a friend, a therapist, a loved one, an enemy, or it may be the memory of a relationship. The mentally ill person often does not experience within the power to make the necessary changes that would bring about a more enhanced and meaningful better life. To break out of the isolation of mental illness the person has to break out of the limitations he or she places around himself or herself. And then it is possible to be open, to interact, to bond with another, to find a healthy meaningful life.</p>
<p>By way of summary, I would mention all the many words that come to mind when we speak of helping people move out of their mental illness through community care, the care that is constituted in being together in small highly specialized live-in communities. There are many words we need to keep in mind – interaction, relating, having a purpose, belonging, containment, safety, acceptance, permissiveness, communication, openness, group ethos, involvement, living- learning, reality confrontation, agency, empowerment, democratization, decisions, sincerity. Wonderful words – each of them necessary for mental health.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Personal Attachments in Communities </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>hat for convenience I am terming attachment theory is a way of conceptualizing the propensity of human beings to make strong affectional bonds to particular others and of explaining the many forms of emotional distress and personality disturbance, including anxiety, anger, depression, and emotional detachment, to which unwilling separation and loss give rise.</p>
<p>Briefly put, attachment behaviour is conceived as any form of behaviour that results in a person attaining or retaining proximity to some other differentiated and preferred individual, who is usually conceived as stronger and / or wiser. Whilst especially evident during early childhood, attachment behaviour is held to characterize human beings from the cradle to the grave – John Bowlby, 1976.</p>
<p>In a therapeutic community attachments leading to healthy relationships form the basis that leads to recovery. A school, a college is often just a collectivity for the ill person. The hospital he or she would experience as a collectivity. In some instances given the problems caused by the disabled person within the family, the relations within the family unit come to be more of a collectivity than a close family community. In the collectivity there is often a distrust of relationships and the accompanying intense emotional and behavioural problems. In a real community following the principles of the therapeutic community approach, members strive to develop close dependant relationships, within a group living milieu.</p>
<p>The human relationships between people are of therapeutic value as they provide acceptance, affirmation of a person’s individuality and an experience of involvement, trust and separation. Also in close relationships, a person can become aware of his or her impact on others and can experience and perhaps resolve tensions that arise. As patterns of behaving towards others emerge or emotional turmoil is expressed in relationships, this becomes material that can be presented to help someone see themselves more clearly.</p>
<p>Rex Haigh lists the five ingredients of a therapeutic community and presents them as a developmental sequence, from the earliest experience of attachment, to maternal and paternal aspects of containment, and the task to make contact with others in a way which allows intimate and mutative communication to happen, then on to the adolescent struggle of involvement and finding one’s mutual responsibilities amongst others, and finally to an adult empowered position of agency – finding the self which is the seat of action and from which true personal power and effectiveness must come.</p>
<p>“…The first task of treatment is to reconstruct a secure attachment, and then use that to bring about changes in deeply ingrained expectations of relationships and patterns of behaviour. The culture in which this attachment needs to happen is one where the community members can clearly feel a sense of belonging – where membership is valued and where members themselves are valued”.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Learning to live an appreciable and appreciated life in this Therapeutic Community </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he persons coming into the community today must begin by a realization and acceptance of the problems and difficulties that they experience in communicating and opening their life through meaningful contact and sharing with other persons.</p>
<p>As a beginning they need to develop an openness to discover from where within their conscious life the cause or causes of their mental and emotional discomfort arises.</p>
<p>As they experience a growth in awareness and comfort they will experience the difficulty and frustration that rises as they experience their inability to function freely and smoothly in their interactions with others.</p>
<p>And so they begin to notice and pay attention to the manner in which others seem to react and behave smoothly and efficiently in contrast to the hesitations and inability to cope with the demands of living with others which they experience as a losing struggle.</p>
<p>Going through these problems will appear to be a continuing defeat. The manner in which they should handle themselves in the face of others is often a mystery. They struggle and yet are unable to make the necessary simple adaptations and on the spot choices which normal people easily make.</p>
<p>The inability to adapt easily to situations usually arises from their negative outlook or difficulty in relating to other people, whether strangers or persons of their own family with whom they should be able to relate positively and freely as they wish.</p>
<p>If they come to some realization that their experience is seriously different from the others who appear to have no difficulties in interacting with others, then they hopefully will begin to question themselves and speak about their personal difficulties to persons who are able to understand the original cause of their problems.</p>
<p>As they move with others and cause concern to others because of their hysterical unstable reactions, they are medicated down to help them cope with the life experience they are attempting to live.</p>
<p>The lucky ones may be placed in a community such as ours where they will be supported in accepting the experience of being themselves even as they live through their disturbing and depressing inner experience.</p>
<p>And hopefully they will hit upon or experience the deep inner assurance developing from within their personalities as they come to realize that they have the possibility open to them of forming a meaningful relationship with another person.</p>
<p>This relationship will develop even without their realizing the effort and trust they may have made to trigger the relationship.</p>
<p>Just simple openness to experience the new found ease of living in some simple form of relationship or interior freedom and openness may trigger a decision to strive to be responsible for self.</p>
<p>From incomplete sensations and moments of awareness they find that they can settle within themselves and develop full consciousness in their thinking, feeling and attitudes and beliefs.</p>
<p>All of this will help to bring about within them some sort of peace with their mind and body plus a willingness to be constructive in their attitudes and beliefs with others, and more open to make the changes within themselves and to discover what it means to be important, significant and related to others.</p>
<p>They begin to learn where and when the difficulties were when they were very young. They can always explain their present behaviour and are open to dialogue so as to bring and cause for themselves the necessary adjustments if any are needed in their reflection and planning.</p>
<p>They will discover a new and enhanced interest in persons plus give a growing value to their own life and that of others.</p>
<p>This individual ability to choose – it is really an individual power within the individual – allows the person to develop other abilities that are helpful in dealing with the surroundings. The ability to choose my reaction timings, to control the force of my reaction, leads to self-control. This self-control enables the person to delay his or her reaction and to resist the quick impulses which often cause a breakdown of communication with another person.</p>
<p>Most people would wish to have solid self-control so that they can avoid the many negative situations that sometimes arise. An example could be the experience arising when an immediate, spontaneous, angry reply breaks up or destroys a family relation or friendship. Also they can keep their hope and interest alive when someone says that a certain accomplishment cannot come about, cannot be resolved. For many people, when they are told such a proposal cannot possibly be successful, they will be stimulated even more to work for a successful solution.</p>
<p>This ability to keep these two beliefs alive allows a person to be creative in holding a problem or difficulty in their attention for some time so that then they can consider the problem from many different angles and see it anew and open to a solution.</p>

<p>How much am I aware of my values, my thoughts enter into my therapy or counseling ?</p>
<p>What inner decisions or work with myself will bring me more present to others as I work or speak to them.</p>

<p>How much do I believe that joy or well being will be experienced only from some experience of relationship?</p>
<p>Or what within myself do I base my belief?</p>
<p>The big mortal sin of what Jacqui got into was working with people who were severely ill using the attachment theory quite successfully.</p>
<p>“The key point of my thesis is that there is a strong casual relationship between an individual’s experiences with his parents and his later capacity to make affectional bonds, and that certain common variations in that capacity manifest in themselves in marital problems, trouble with children as well as in neurotic symptoms and personality disorders can be attributed to certain common variations in the ways that parents performed their roles”.</p>
<p>-John Bowlby “The Making and breaking of Affectional Bonds”. “From birth to death, love is not just the focus of human experience but also the life force of the mind, determining our moods, stabilizing our body rhythms, and changing the structure of our brains. The body’s physiology ensures that relationships determine and fix our identities. Love makes us who we are, and who we can become”.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Complexities in the Human Personality </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he goal of all that we do here in the community is to enable young people to function as best they can. To be reliable in the human process, functioning as an independent person we need to be aware of all that contributes to our functioning. Each person desires to understand their life and their various experiences. The experiences that some have can enable them to live a meaningful and happy life. A person has to realize the complexity of their personality, for the human personality is really very complex. Prominent in the personality are the feelings, thinking, beliefs and attitudes. You need to consider that the feelings, thinking, beliefs and attitudes are initiated because of the various levels of the human personality. There is a great complexity when you consider the biological, cultural, psychological and societal tensions keep the human persona alive. Without this complexity we would not have an active human life.</p>
<p>If the human person is to enjoy and find meaning in this complexity they need a tremendous degree of awareness. The individual has to find some sort of self reliance which will enable him or her to relate to others and in this relationship develop their ability to trust others. Accepting others on this secure base enables the person to function as one whole person. Then the person is able to function and grow and appreciate their own self and share the self with others. From this secure base the person will have the full free energy to think and choose, trust and form an attachment with other people.</p>
<p>The person will have the ability to freely decide what fits best for him or her now. If a person is not clear and aware in their decision making process, they will not have the necessary freedom to function and communicate with others. Without clarity in the thinking and feeling there will be some condemnation of their thinking as they cannot let go of their feelings and be reactive in their environment.</p>
<p>Other persons who can be aware of their free energy will be able to function and cooperate in building up friendships and society.</p>
<p>This free energy is necessary for the proper functioning in communications with others.</p>
<p>When a person is not free he or she will not be aware of the feelings that are causing them to be confused. Now we need to look at what happens when a person looses his awareness that they should have of the difficulties that they are causing themselves. Often a person may dislike the manner in which he is being corrected and treated, and will because of this distress become very angry. This anger may be expressed and when spoken about may enable the person to reflect and let go of the anger. It is possible that the person does not recognize the feelings of anger and so cannot express their discomfort. With the anger they will often become afraid so they will remain quite disturbed and afraid, whereas the true feeling of anger will not be recognized. This will limit the person’s interaction with other people.</p>

<p>It is known by what we can do – by our awareness – to know that we can know – to be aware that we are aware – to decide and decide to decide – to give myself to another and to know that that is what fulfils me.</p>
<p>As spirits we transcend ourselves – we go beyond ourselves – our existence is a call at all times to transcend ourselves – to go out beyond ourselves – simply put it is to go out to the other – to be the other.</p>
<p>This transcendence takes place at all the different levels of the human person.</p>
<p>-at the level of experience - we are aware that we are always reacting in this life we lead – there are persons and things that impinge on us from outside – we transcend ourselves in the simple level of awareness that we have as we live and move with people - we learn to be attentive.</p>
<p>-at the level of understanding – this sense data is absorbed within us and we react in knowing that this sense data comes from this person or thing- we transcend ourselves in that we put two and two together and say that this is – we are called to be intelligent.</p>
<p>-at the level of reflection – what we have understood we reflect on - we reason about the person or the situation.</p>
<p>-we want to see what it really is – we are moved to have some ground for what we are concerned with – we convince ourselves with reasons – so we are called to be reasonable.</p>
<p>-then when we have found the reasons for this person or situation we are called further - to find out the importance for the person or situation for us – we move into values. </p>
<p>And so from seeing the person as important or the situation as important we are called to be committed. </p>
<p>- then we are called beyond to share with the other – to be for the other person - we are called to be loving. </p>
<p>The universe then is build on this call to love each other – to share with each other – to go out to the other – the oneness, the unity that is at the heart of all the great religions.</p>
<p>We as individuals are called to transcend our limited selvesthere is the inner dynamism with the human personality which is searching for unity.</p>
<p>Take many of the new ideas – in medicine – in teaching – in psychology – that are prevalent in our modern world. These few ideas express the hidden dynamism in human nature today. And we must be aware of these ideas and realize how the trends which they describe are present within us. These same trends are present in people whom we are working with and we can in some way or other appeal to those trends.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Authenticity </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">D</span>ecisions you make as an actor in the drama of human living It is necessary always to take some time for reflection on what is passing through your consciousness – what are you consciously sensing at the present time – just at the present time, the present moment – not the past now – not the future, now reflect – pay attention – reflect – come to be aware – realize what you are aware of within your awareness , what you are conscious of right now.</p>
<p>Concentrate – be aware – be conscious - ok , what is in your mind now…</p>
<p>Discover yourself – reflect on yourself – conscious of yourself – discover what you are aware of now in your self – focus on your self – examine your self – intense awareness of your self – focus your energy on your consciousness – being conscious of self.</p>
<p>Your psychic energy – not a bodily feeling – a conscious feeling – concentrate on this energy within your awareness – that is your athma shakti – centre your self on this awareness – on this reflection.What are you consciously aware of ? Stop – control your awareness – let yourself know what you are discovering in yourself now – what are you thinking/ What are you discovering?</p>
<p>What are you experiencing within yourself?</p>
<p>What are you sensing? What are you experiencing? What are you undergoing now? What are you feeling?</p>
<p>No thinking – just feeling – feeling – being aware</p>
<p>Stop! Be conscious – be aware</p>
<p>Now be in charge – what are you experiencing?</p>
<p><strong>For Lonergan, a very learned Jesuit scholar and writer,</strong> then our deepest need and most prized achievement is authenticity. Our “deepest need and most prized achievement is authenticity”.</p>
<p>Be aware, he urges us, of the operations within our consciousness. Notice the basic desire of our spirit for meaning, truth, goodness, and love – orientations that are open to God. He asked us, in effect:</p>
<p>- What in your consciousness reveals your desire for understanding for meaning? </p>
<p>- What are the operations you perform to test whether your understanding is accurate? </p>
<p>- What operations do you perform when you are faced with making a decision? What process do you go through to make sure your decision is good, worthwhile, responsible? What questions arise, what factors do you take into account, what feelings influence your decisions? </p>
<p>Pay attention to these operations in your consciousness, Lonergan directs us, and we will discover in them the norms for authentic living. We are to be</p>
<p>-attentive to the experience of the data of sense and of consciousness</p>
<p>-intelligent about inquiring into the meaning or our experience</p>
<p>-critical in our judgment</p>
<p>-responsible in our decisions and all of this becomes possible as the fruit of God’s love inundating the human heart.</p>
<p>Yield to the inbuilt intentionality of your own consciousness, he advises us, and you will eventually discover “a region for the divine, the shrine of ultimate holiness,… the spark in our clod, our native orientation to the divine.”</p>
<p>In brief, Lonergan invites the reader to an exercise in intentionality analysis. Intentionality analysis is an examination of consciousness. But he warns us, it takes “an exceptional amount of exertion and activity” to succeed in paying attention to the operations in your consciousness. The reader, he admits, faces a stiff challenge: “He will have to familiarize himself with our terminology. He will have to evoke the relevant operations in his own consciousness. He will have to discover in his own experience the dynamic relationships leading from one operation to the next.”</p>
<p>So, first of all, he instructs us, notice that the operations within your consciousness have objects. Examine our consciousness and discover that it is dynamic, always on the move. Consciousness is intentional: it intends towards, reaches out of itself towards an object. To intend is not just a transitive verb; in the psychological sense, to say that the operations of consciousness intend means that they have objects, tend toward objects, reach out toward objects to note them, understand them, make judgments and decisions about them, and, if they are persons, love them. Further, it is by the operations of consciousness , Lonergan continues, that one becomes aware of the object and become present to the object. “ By seeing there becomes present what is seen, by hearing that becomes present what is heard, by imagining there become present what is imagined, and so on, where in each case the presence in question is a psychological event”. It is in this psychological sense, then, Lonergan uses the verb intend, and adjective intentional, and the noun intentionality.</p>
<p>Second, writes Lonergan, be aware that intentionally operations are operations of an operator. Examine your consciousness and discover that you are the conscious operator in charge of the operations. This operator Lonergan calls the subject. The operator is not merely the subject of the verbs “attend to, see, hear, touch” and so forth. The operator is the subject in the psychological sense; he operates consciously. The operator is “aware of himself operating, present to himself operating, experiencing himself operating.” In so far as operations are intentional, then, they “make the operating subject present to himself”. Self appropriation -being present to oneself and grasping what goes on in consciousness – is a heightening of consciousness. In addition, the exercise of selfappropriation generates horizons, because the exercise utilizes the inbuilt structure that generates horizons. Indeed it is the intent of his book to point out in considerable appropriation and self-definition, utilize the structure within human consciousness that creates horizons.</p>
<p>What Lonergan is concerned with is the “realization of human potentiality”. But the realization of human potentiality can be authentic or unauthentic. But it is obvious that one can never achieve human authenticity once and for all by a single deliberate act. The most important deliberate act, for Lonergan, is love.</p>
<p>True, Lonergan admits, with God’s grace you freely make yourself what you are, but he immediately adds a word of caution:</p>
<p>“Never in this life is the making finished; always it is still in progress, always it is in precarious achievement that can slip and fall and shatter. Concern with subjectivity, then is concern with the ultimate reality of man… with the perpetual novelty of self – construction, of free choices making the chooser what he is.”</p>
<p>It is for this reason that those who are intrigued by “the perpetual novelty of self-construction” and who in response to God’s love come up with the “free choices” that make the “chooser what he is” can with profit repeat the Spiritual Exercises year after year and make the Examen of Consciousness each day of their lives.</p>
<p>In short, what does Lonergan’s intentionality analysis tell us about the dynamic of the Spiritual exercises? The retreatant who attempts to avoid disorderly love and give himself totally to God will during the Exercises is (upon examination of his consciousness) acting in accord with the dynamic structure of his intentionality and following the inbuilt laws by which human beings can, with God’s grace transcend self-centered desire and reach out toward human authenticity and genuine Christian holiness. Dynamic structure and inbuilt laws are you yourself, in your spiritual reality, your potentiality, what you are open to: being fully in love with God; but that full achievement of your potential is all God’s doing and the operative text for Lonergan is Ezekiel: “God plucking out the heart of stone which has no desire whatever to be a heart of flesh and putting in the heart of flesh, totally beyond the deserts, ambitions even, of the heart of stone.”</p>
<p><strong>Lonergan – From "Dynamism of Desire", Page 75 </strong></p>
<p>Be attentive. Be intelligent. Be reasonable. Be responsible.</p>
<p>Being attentive includes attention to human affairs (community functioning).</p>
<p>Being intelligent includes a grasp of hitherto unnoticed or unrelated possibilities.</p>
<p>Being reasonable includes the rejection of what probably would not work but also the acknowledgement of what probably would.</p>
<p>Being responsible includes basing one’s decisions and choices on an unbiased evaluation of short-term and long-term costs and benefits to oneself, to one’s group, to other groups.</p>
<p><strong>Page 79 </strong></p>
<p>Human authenticity is a matter of following the built-in law of the human spirit. Because we can experience, we should attend. Because we can understand, we should inquire. Because we can reach the truth, we should reflect and check. Because we can realize values in ourselves and promote them in others, we should deliberate. In the measure that we follow these percepts, in the measure we fulfill these conditions of being human persons we also achieve self-transcendence both in the field of knowledge and in the filed of action.</p>
<p>Lonergan thus spells out how one’s activity at the fourth level of consciousness is both practical and existential.</p>
<p>On the topmost level of human consciousness the subject deliberates, evaluates, decides, controls, acts. At once he is practical and existential : practical in as much as he is concerned with concrete courses of action; existential in as much as control includes self-control, and the possibility of self-control involves responsibility for the effects of his actions on others and more basically on himself. The top most level of human consciousness is conscience.</p>
<p>-Self control : keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check.</p>
<p>-Trustworthiness : Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity</p>
<p>-Conscientiousness : taking responsibility for personal performance</p>
<p>-Adaptability : Flexibility in handling change</p>
<p>-Innovation : Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and new information</p>
<p><strong>Motivation </strong></p>
<p>Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</p>
<p>-Achievement drive : Striving to improve or meet a standard of excellence.</p>
<p>-Commitment : Aligning with the goals of the group or organization</p>
<p>-Initiative: readiness to act on opportunities</p>
<p>-Optimism : persistence in pursuing goals despite obstacles and setbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Social competence </strong></p>
<p>These competencies determine how we handle relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy </strong></p>
<p>Awareness of others’ feelings, needs and concerns</p>
<p>-  Understanding others: Sensing others’ feelings and perspectives and taking an active interest in their concerns </p>
<p>-  Developing others : Sensing others’ development needs and bolstering their abilities. </p>
<p>-Service orientation : Anticipating, recognizing, and meeting other’s needs</p>
<p>-Leveraging diversity: cultivating opportunities through different kinds of people</p>
<p>- Political awareness: Reading a group’s emotional currents and power relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Social skills </strong></p>
<p>Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others</p>
<p>-Influence: Wielding effective tactics for persuasion</p>
<p>-Communication : Listening openly and sending convincing messages</p>
<p>-Conflict management: Negotiating and resolving disagreements</p>
<p>-Leadership: Inspiring and guiding individuals and groups</p>
<p>-Change catalyst : initiating or managing change</p>
<p>-Building bonds: nurturing instrumental relationships</p>
<p>-Collaboration and cooperation: working with others toward shared goals.</p>
<p>-Team capabilities : Creating group synergy in pursuing collective goals.</p>

 		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">d. Talks from Training Programs Frame of Reference </h1>
<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he following may serve as some introduction to today’s paper for discussion – “The mind never rests.” Modern life presents information at an extraordinary rate. Many capsules of unfinished business would be ready to burst open for rethinking if a moment’s respite were to occur. Repressive brooding, anxious worry, embarrassed rehearsals of anticipated performances are common.</p>
<p>Yet the topic, mode and manners of ongoing conscious thought can be affected by will and intention. Suggestions can be made to “free associate”, “focus on breathing”, “report dreams”, “switch to visual images”, “tune up the background mood”, or “listen to far-off sounds”, as well as to select or let go of certain topics. One can learn from such exercises and can in a given mental state accomplish some aspects of self stepping in and schematizing or making more simple what cannot be accomplished in other states of mind. One word we need to consider in our study is the word “redefining”, a practice which people can use to be more clear in their thinking or to remain more unclear.</p>
<p>All of us carry with us a “frame of reference”– that is a collection of ideas and beliefs and definitions that enable us to know who we are and what we are and how we fit into the world and also the fundamental definition of what the world is. We need some definitions, some orienting to give each of us in our own style or practice ideas of what is important. Each of us must have all this information for ourselves. In doing this we set up what words are important for our vocabulary.</p>
<p>An Eskimo will have some 200 words for snow. He needs them for his frame of reference, for his conversations with other Eskimos, for each one has their own frame of reference but my personal frame of reference must also in some manner fit and be appropriate with the frame of reference of others with whom I live and interact.</p>
<p>Otherwise I may experience serious difficulties and differences with persons with whom I am coming into contact. What they say and how they react may not fit in with my frame of reference, that is what I am used to, what I feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>We all want to experience comfort in our living, we do not want to be met with what we can’t understand or don’t expect. And yet we cannot expect the persons whom we meet to think exactly as we think, to be interested in what we are interested in, or to immediately understand what we are feeling and thinking. We must be aware, of what our frame of reference is. Have I ever taken the time to reflect and decide just what are my attitudes, my beliefs about myself, about who I am, about how I live my life, or how I handle my feelings, my inner life, my principles, who I really am and what I consider important for myself, and important for other people.</p>
<p>Philosophers speak about passing through the various seas of illusion and coming to the shore or pure awareness. Can I make a clear assessment of myself and responsibly assess my self? “Understand the principle that all psychological growth comes about by being able to renounce outworn, infantile, ties to objects and to give up or modify self-representations that have become restrictive, maladaptive or outgrown”. So, writes a noted philosopher.</p>
<p>It is my duty to be aware of the various differences I may experience with others around me, and realize my need to resolve any problems that may arise because of this situation. If I do not agree with the person or the situation in which I find myself, I need to acknowledge the differences. I may find myself experiencing feelings of being upset, or afraid, feelings that arise from some difficulty in a situation structured differently for me. Or I may experience that at present what I experience doesn’t seem to fit, this is so new to me, it doesn’t seem to fit my present frame of reference so I have difficulty in freely and meaningfully fitting in, and quietly feeling composed.</p>
<p>That has been the daily experience of many of our kids as they have grown up. Also caretakers and parents may have had the same experience when they were sons or daughters in an early life where they felt distant and lost. Those who are parents today may have encountered many very stressful, unintelligible encounters, incidents, and happenings during the teenage years. And so many young persons have ended up in a life they could not predict, because all was upset, fears were present, angers pushed down into the unconscious as was done habitually in the past.</p>
<p>What to do in this threatening situation? Take the seemingly only possible solution – sit down and use what sense I have and redefine the situation in some manner. The person can redefine the incoming stimuli, redefine what is happening with them so that they can handle the stimuli coming at them from the present surroundings. So, the young person who is suffering because of his father’s uncontrollable anger tries to believe that his father is only protecting him. Then he can cope as people have learned to cope in the past. Some people redefine the reality because they are afraid to deal with the reality as it is, or experience being incapable or inadequate to deal with it, or feel the need to ignore what is happening so they can comfortably deal with it.</p>
<p>In building a path through the self to the far shore of awareness, we have to carefully pick our way through our own wilderness. We need to have some beneficial trust in our ability to handle our thoughts and attitudes, our feelings, and other happenings in our mind, quietly becoming clearer in our thinking, letting all our awareness take in the various obstacles we sense within our self or that are coming from others outside us, staying aware that whatever is coming at me by way of questions and statements can be handled. Then I can if possible, give time to reflection and judge, weigh the input coming to me from these people, thinking and weighing the meaning and importance of all this as I organize to fit the experience adequately into my understanding. Once I have the needed insight into the happenings I can enable myself to define where this all fits with my present and future need, always taking into consideration my future desires and aspirations.</p>
<section class="level2 unnumbered" epub:type="chapter" role="doc-chapter" id="id-">
 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Discounting </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he different things we will look at in discounting: the definition, the internal mechanism, what discounting is used for, what its purpose is. Then we will look at the areas of discounting, the type of discounting, and the mode – all these are technical terms which I will explain as we go. And what is the treatment for discounting. The way to put it really, to start it off – when there is a ‘game’, when there is dysfunctional behavior, there is some kind of symbiotic relationship that has not been resolved. I can be running out a ‘number’ with an older male figure because there is a relationship with my father that has not been resolved or I may be looking for attention because of the symbiotic relationship with my mother that has not been resolved. There should be a healthy symbiotic relationship for every child and then, the child moves out of the symbiotic relationship and establishes his independence. Now, when there is a symbiotic relationship, in some way internally, I have to justify it to myself. Within my personality there is a normal move to health, to independence and to good relationships. And what blocks that is some sort of a symbiotic relationship and then, I justify what I do by discounting. The further step in there is the type of the justification really, is the grandiosity. And the discount is the minimizing or maximizing of some aspect of myself, of the other person or the reality of the situation. That’s really what the discount is. I maximize and say you are so scary that I can’t talk to you. I am maximizing my fear within myself.</p>
<p>I have got a question. Can this justification come from these two positions. “I am ok, You are not ok or you are ok, I am not ok’’?</p>
<p>Yes. The not okayness is involved in the symbiotic relationship. In an unhealthy symbiotic relationship one of us is not okay or both of us are not okay so that the discount is the maximizing or the minimizing of some aspect of myself, of the other person or the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>The minimizing: ‘I can’t do that. That’s too hard for me. I could never put up with that’. What we would call the minimizing of my ability to put up with something; the minimizing of self, something in myself, in the other or the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>It is an internal mechanism. What do you mean by internal? Something deep or something within myself that I am not aware of doing. (If I am aware of it, that’s deliberate and that’s not a discount). It is internal. There is an external manifestation that I can see in the behavior. Yes, I don’t know whether it is a discount until I find out what is the internal process the person is going through.</p>
<p>A young man hassles with people. Where is the discount? The discount is of his fear of handling the situation, fear of talking with other people, fear of being rejected by other people. And there is the internal mechanism. We see him hassling. But the discount is in his minimizing his ability to form relationships. Whatever it is, the fear is in the symbiotic relationship that he has to be afraid. To himself he is saying that he has to be afraid. So he comes from that fear and discounts his ability to form relationships with people and uses the anger to stay with that. The anger is the external manifestation that we see. And then, we react to something that makes us uncomfortable. We say there is something going on here. We have to question him and find out where the discount is in him, what he is doing to discount. We can see it in somebody in a very dangerous situation, may be doing something that is very dangerous and we can say we don’t really know whether he is discounting his own safety. He may not be. He may not be aware of what he is doing. We can see the external manifestation but we don’t see what is going on internally in the person that he is discounting. He has to tell us. With this reality situation one thing we come from is that there is a discount what we do with the kids here very often, we get a group and say what you did was very stupid. And we agree that this is stupid. There it is understood that below all this theory is the fact that we agree: ‘You are out of step’. You are discounting something in the real situation. There is something you need to think about. Just to point that out ….that the reality of the situation is what was agreed by the group and you are doing something that is not fitting in with the group. There is something in yourself or in the other person or in us or in the reality of the situation that you are ignoring, not paying attention to or you are making too big or you are making too small so that you can carry on the aspect of yourself that is dysfunctional.</p>
<p>“May I ask a question? If you have a group of people which is distorting reality and then, comes a person …”</p>
<p>“Hopefully, you will agree that not everybody will be wrong all the time. And you can have a situation where a group of people are seeing things wrong.”</p>
<p>“You all agree on discounting something in order to keep to the group?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. But in the wider circle there is going to be somebody who is going to confront.”</p>
<p>“The problem for me is whether reality is objective or subjective because…”</p>
<p>I would say it is objective, in that not everybody can deny this is the situation. Some people might deny from their subjective positions but there are bound to be some people who are going to say that the car hit the tree – that’s objective. And not everybody will deny it. A few people might deny it ( like the car did not hit the tree), that’s possible.</p>
<p>Discounting means some degree of denial.</p>
<p>There is a type of denial.</p>
<p>.... take Arvind – I tell Arvind that his mother died and there is no real reaction. And what would be the healthy reaction? A healthy reaction is that the person would be in touch with what a loving mother meant to him and he’s lost her and there would be some sadness. But when there is no sadness, no awareness – that’s denial. A person who is really denying is not aware that he is denying.</p>
<p>A hebephrenic we say, who uses the highest levels of denial – ‘I can be great friends with you and I can kill you too’. I am denying the anger that I have as if I am not even in touch with the anger. Yes, denial is a form of discounting but it’s a very extreme form of discounting.</p>
<p>A term that comes in here – you will find it in the Reader – what we call a frame of reference. This is a fancy way of saying ‘the way I see things’. It covers all, Parent, Adult and Child completely. What comes in, I take in according to my frame of reference, “Perception”.</p>
<p>Okay, perception, and I use the discount – like Anand who doesn’t take it in that people care for him. Yet, he continues to obsess, so that in his perception, there is no perception of somebody really caring.</p>
<p>Like Pat also, in a way. Pat doesn’t perceive that the other kids like him. He doesn’t perceive at the level that they accept him, enjoy him being around. That’s according to his frame of reference and he will interpret what people say, what people do to fit into his frame of reference. So, he can discount what people do for him, what people say to him in order to keep his frame of reference going.</p>
<p>“So, you mean to say that if you confront him he will convert it. He will not look at it from a positive frame of reference. He will use it in a negative way to say that ‘people don’t care about me’ and I am not okay’ and so on.”</p>
<p>Well, not quite. He will fit it into his frame of reference as we call it. It will end up being positive or it will end up being negative. He interprets it. We pretty well interpret everything. The reality that comes to us, most of it we are interpreting it. We have the fancy terms ‘the optimist’ and ‘the pessimist’. Well, that’s really what we are talking about but in a more specific way.</p>
<p>A person discounts ….. to keep his frame of reference going. You see, all of us have difficulty in changing, changing our feelings, changing our ideas, changing our learning. Great difficulty. Now, if it is at a limit that these kids here who are really dysfunctional – it is very scary to change. So he needs to discount what is said to him or what is done to him, the behaviors that come to him. They need to discount in order to carry on the old frame of reference that has been simply put that I am okay and I have to see everything through that. Shalini does that quite often. In her frame of reference she is not okay so she takes things in, turns them around and makes herself not okay.</p>
<p>Another thing that we have when we see the discounting – the discounting helps to carry on a passive behavior. Like the person who is not aware that he is agitating. He is discounting what he is doing. We see the manifestation. They are not aware that they are doing it. Very often, you will see it in a group here, an example of discounting. Let’s see – a person is being confronted for taking too much food on his plate and he is being told ‘you should not be taking that much of food on your plate? He will say ‘there is only that plate left’.</p>
<p>What I have said has nothing to do with the confrontation you have made of me. I have discounted what you said and I have what we say ‘redefined’. I have given you an answer that suits me. I don’t fit in what you have said to me. I have not paid attention to that. I have discounted that and I answer with my own “yes, but”:</p>
<p>Yes, but…well, that’s the game. That’s leading into a game. You have in T.A. theory, a game transaction. But the redefining is very, very righteous. If you notice kids redefining, it’s very important to pick that up. They will pick it up themselves. But they won’t pick it up on themselves. They will pick it up on others. If you notice that in treatment groups that is a good thing to see. You will see some kids showing some behavior that is discounting, that is redefining and yet, when they finish their work and another kid begins to work they will be confronting another patient on the very thing that they were doing. They can see it in others but they can’t see it in themselves. Well all of us – we can see in other people what we don’t see in ourselves. We discount in ourselves but we can see what others are doing. Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, we don’t know ourselves completely. We are not aware fully of ourselves and we spend some time putting it in terms. It is either because we want to carry on the feelings that we are having and keep the feelings. And this is the contamination of feelings, contaminated thinking. So, I am not thinking clearly to see it in you. I am contaminated.</p>
<p>Now, there is a good part in the Reader- we divide first of all the area – what we call the area of discount which is the self, the others, the reality of the situation. Then you have the type of discount. Now, I can discount the stimuli. For instance, there is a very bad, cold wind coming through the window there where I am sitting in a thin T-shirt and I say ‘I am not feeling cold’. I am denying the stimuli; the person burns himself and doesn’t notice it. That’s a discount of stimuli.</p>
<p>But does he discount the effect too?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily. I can be – there is the agitation there but I am denying or I am not paying attention to the physical reaction in my body. I have a physical reaction in my body. The stimulus is there, but I am not paying attention to it.</p>
<p>I can see you crying and I just walk out of the door. I discount the stimuli of seeing you suffering and in pain. I just don’t bother with it. That’s the stimuli.</p>
<p>Isn’t that a discount also of the other person?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s what I say; the self is my physical reaction. Now, when I perceive somebody else going through something physically or what they say…see, that “I said that I like what you did” and then you say, “Well you know I always had trouble doing this in school”. My positive stroke…. you redefine it. You don’t take in my positive stroke. You discount the positive stimuli and the positive stroke. You redefine it and say, ‘well, I was never good at this in school which has no reference at all to the positive stroke that I gave’.</p>
<p>“Would the discount occur in isolation as when …..” No, I can discount something’s. I can discount a very bad tooth ache.</p>
<p>“That will be the stimuli as well as myself ?”</p>
<p>Well, it is myself. See, for self I can have the stimuli and then, the problem and the options. For the other I can have the stimuli, the problem and the options. See, I myself, I have pain in the stomach. But everybody has a pain in the stomach so often. No problem and then the options “Why do doctors always give me medicines?” I can never do anything about the pain in my stomach. I have tried everything. No options.</p>
<p>See in each area I can take the type of stimuli. Reality of the situation : what is the stimuli in the situation, what is the problem and what are the options.</p>
<p>Then, another word they use is the ‘mode’. A mode is – I can discount the existence of the problem.</p>
<p>That’s the denial, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Yes. You come in here, shouting like mad and angry at me, tell me I am a stupid fool. And I say “fine” I just sit down. You shouted at me and I don’t register at all and this we do often, at smaller levels too. When somebody is talking in an agitated way I don’t pay attention to that stimuli, the existence of that stimuli. Now, that you are talking in an agitated way, I should, how important is that? What is the significance of your speaking in such a quick way? Is there any significance? I don’t pay any attention to that.</p>
<p>“If you don’t pay any attention to the fact that he is speaking fast, in an agitated manner, you don’t ask him the reason behind it. That’s the second discount.”</p>
<p>It is not the second discount, it all works - the deeper the discount. First of all, there is the stimuli, the problem and the options. Now, I can deny the existence of the stimuli. I cannot deny the existence of the problem that it is a problem. And I can deny the existence of any options. I had it all worked out in a group. I did it on the bus driver with bad brakes. I had twelve discounts, all worked out. “There is nothing the matter with the brakes” Then the significance “oh, it’s not important – You can always stop …..You can still carry on.”</p>
<p>Then, there is the solvability, the change ……….people are always going to be like that. You are discounting the possibilities of change. And then, you have the last one: the personal discount.</p>
<p>“You don’t expect him to do that? Him?” Discounting his ability to change.</p>
<p>Then I can discount that it’s a problem……. You have got a pain in your stomach, “that will pass”…. the significance of that. “Once you get problems in your stomach you can’t get them fixed up anyway. I can’t …..with diets and taking medicines. It’s too much of a bother for me”.</p>
<p>And then the options. It is impossible to get rid of it. You have got a pain in the stomach. “There is nothing you can do about it.” Or…..There is too much to do…. I have got no time. Viability of the options - “I don’t know which doctor I can choose.”</p>
<p>“I heard about that specialist. He is not so good”.</p>
<p>So, the important thing is that on a wider chart, will it help me if am discounting the stimuli. I am going to be discounting the importance. I am going to be discounting the change, possibilities. I am going to be discounting my ability to change. So, if a person is not in touch with his feelings he is not going to realize the importance of his feelings, he is not going to realize that he can change those feelings or that he himself can change those feelings. So, that’s why we stress so much getting in touch with the feelings as soon as we can.</p>
<p>If I am discounting that my pain in the stomach is important – well it’s not a problem, I don’t see it as a problem. If I am discounting that it is an important problem then, I am not going to bother looking for any options.</p>
<p>Now, in treatment what do we do? When we look at the discount there is usually contamination of thinking. Adult is usually contaminated or the person is excluding Adult. “I always feel miserable” is a contamination of the Adult. “Always”- it is a fact that I must always feel miserable. Your Child feeling of being miserable, sad (“I must always feel sad”) …….contamination of Adult by Child. And “I was so angry I couldn’t think”, which is a discount of my ability to think and which is an exclusion of Adult.</p>
<p>Now treatment : what we look for are the external manifestations of the discounts – the transactions, the behaviors, the games that come from the discounting. From the transactions come confronting transactions, confronting behaviors. That’s why I said from one little transaction the other day – confronting a small transaction where we feel there is a discount then, we can find out really, where the discount is, is it in the person himself and can open up doors very much. So, we want to identify the manifestations. We see the manifestations in the transactions, the behaviors, and in the games. And then we focus- once you have the discount – where is it? Is the person discounting his ability to change? Is he discounting that anybody can change this? Is he discounting that it is important? Or is he discounting that the problem is really there.</p>
<p>So, technically where would we place it on the chart? What is the type of discount? Because then, if it’s simple – his ability to act on options that’s not so- you know Pat whether he is going to get up in the morning, he doesn’t think: can he ask somebody to wake him up? Can he get an alarm clock? Can he decide himself before he goes to sleep that this is the time he is going to get up? Is he discounting his various options? Or is he discounting that the depression makes him stay in bed every morning – there is a difference. If we can see that it is depression, it is a fear of getting up, a fear of meeting people that is causing him not to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>Now, then how much is a person invested in keeping the discount? Why is he so invested in keeping it? Why is Anand so passive? What is the discount underneath his obsessing? What is his investment in keeping that going? When he sees the discounting then, you can work out what he can do differently and hopefully he will follow that. He may not. That’s his investment in keeping it or not, that you have to see.</p>
<p>“But don’t you think that will be rather hard because if he has used that frame of reference for a long time then…”</p>
<p>Okay, sure. Shalini this morning – what did she do? What did she need to do to change the attitude ‘I am not ok’? And there you are working with her — what therapy is going to work out for her which she needs to get? She needs to change her frame of reference but how are you going to do that ? Giving her strokes? Getting her to think? Or making her take-in the messages?</p>
<p>Then, you are working out some positive movement when the person has seen the discounting and is trying to work without it. And finally, what you get or what you are wanting to get is that the frame of reference. The person …thinks about the internal goes with the internal. I accept Shalini as okay and herself accepts herself as okay. There is integration. In other words, what we would say —the person is able to form relationships that are meaningful and that are straight and true, no longer …needy …symbiotic type of relationship.</p>
<p>Questions, clarifications or anything that you want to add.</p>
<p>“Sadness or something behind the discounting”</p>
<p>Could be anything: fear or anger or sadness. Yes, normally there would be some negative feeling behind it. And the symbiotic relationship is based on the dysfunctional. The inappropriate symbiotic relationship is founded on a negative feeling. There are negative feelings involved.</p>
<p>“Discounting is out of awareness. What happens if I am aware I am doing something and don’t say anything about it? How would you define that?”</p>
<p>Well, I would have to ask you why you do not confront me. You know you are doing it. Then, we might get into : you might be discounting something…..</p>
<p>“You have not discounted the stimulus but you have discounted the significance and personal responsibility in confronting yourself.”</p>
<p>“What is the difference between discounting and passivity? What is the connection?”</p>
<p>Passive behavior is non-problem solving. So, in the discounting I am either not paying attention to the problem or ways of solving it.</p>
<p>“Is discounting also, a passive behavior?”</p>
<p>No, it is a mechanism.</p>
<p>See, the passive behaviors, the doing nothing, the agitation, the over adaptation and the violence or incapacitation – there must be a discount somewhere. I am discounting my ability to solve the problem.</p>
<p>“What about passive aggressive behavior?”</p>
<p>That’s a term different from our Cathexis term.</p>
<p>“Well, I mean someone sits there passively and radiates hostility to people.”</p>
<p>Yes, well it is anger which is different from what we would refer.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Training Program – Voice recording 001 date : Nov 8, 2003 </h2>
<p><strong>Fr.Hank </strong>: Ok, now</p>
<p>1) How do I reach out to another person ?</p>
<p>2) Where do I get stuck in myself? You can try and figure out for yourself what you mean by stuck.</p>
<p><span class="big-letter">F</span>rom the training room that we have, we came out of it to face this real question, we all need to ask ourselves further and make a study sort of reflection, of how the community functions, what is the progress within ourselves as a community, as individuals, because for all individuals living our lives and living together in the community, we all need to keep growing. I know for myself I have to keep growing. In my group, my identity basically is as a priest, joined with a group of men, who are all over the world. When I was 21, I joined a group of men living for spiritual growth and dedication to religion with the aim of helping people. That desire has brought me here to Bangalore. Here in Bangalore a centre for guiding peoples’ spirituality was opening up and I was asked to come and join them in this. So, I helped people with therapy. This was some years ago, One time I doubted whether this community could ever exist. But it became as solid as the building housing the therapeutic community now is. That was 20 years ago when the community seemed to me it would be just a question of our venture, to bring patients from all over the world to Bangalore and to propose to help them resolve their serious emotional and mental problems. How did it all start? When it was proposed to me by Jacqui Schiff, one evening as we talked together and I hesitated to enter into a field that I knew very little about. And one of my problems is that I usually agree to a challenge that comes to me. When I agreed with Jacqui, I had no idea I would play such an important role in establishing and continuing the proposed community. I am sure that the group of patients who had to come with Jacqui from the efficient United States to a disorganized haphazard India in August 1979 never realized how they would end up. I agreed to do a few months training in connection with this in the United States. The time I spent in the program watching, and wondering, and learning, it was my first introduction to the group of bright active young men and women who had serious mental problems, who were certainly ill. I was surprised for they spoke so well about their problems. They described themselves well, they spoke rebelliously of their wants and desires, especially their desires to experience physical contact, support, guidance. At the same time, in the community they were questioned, confronted, for allowing their thinking to wander around with no proper direction. They were given consequences for each mistake, encouraged to build an impressive faith in this new system, the system which they believed would give them the meaning to resolve whatever problems they were carrying within themselves. But Jacqui, their “parent”, the therapist they were depending upon was leaving and coming with me to India, taking with her a few who are willing to face the uncertainties of the unknown and unfamiliar situations of India. Those coming with Jacqui asked me questions, so I became a sort of bridge, a bridge between California and India. Some were eager and others were very frightened. After all Jacqui had the reputation of bringing young people out of their mental disability. One of the newcomers in the open community seemed to be more eager than the others, more committed to her struggle, hoping that India would be her solution. I wondered, as she seemed to me, to have some serious difficulty, as she was on a program to write down meticulously everything she was eating. If she was not eating enough, she did not want to bother about it. Often she was not responsible for herself, or to herself and would not care for herself. One thing she was aware of was her desire to join Jacqui’s safari to India. She was developing the ray of hope that India seemed to offer her. As with many people, India with its old exhaustive culture, became a fascination. For her I was a firm bond to India and that proved to her that India exists. So she was asking many different questions.</p>
<p>The group came to Bangalore. They came to learn psychotherapy and learn to function and live a healthy and happy life. A doctor friend of mine led them to the empty house. I only arrived the next day, and had found it hard to find metal cots and mattresses. I was not all that welcome, having come late, not a very auspicious beginning to our community. I tried to find some fruits and vegetables and easily discovered that fruits and vegetables were available and appreciated. Jacqui agreed to accept a crate of them after they were chemically treated to remove any contamination. In a few days the routine community living began in earnest. The structures and all important therapy sessions that are the backbone of community functioning, were in place. Agreed decisions covered the details of daily routine living. For example, structures were established about who could go outside the house alone, who was to be always restricted in the living room, had to convince this group that the huge dangerous outside world is basically friendly. And so managed to have the group living together happily.</p>
<p>As the human persons that we are, all of us in some way or other search for meaning and happiness. This comes to us from relations that we have with ourselves and with others. Speaking of relationship, it takes me back to the solid stone building, the home as a community in Hulimavu village about 4 kms from the original Athma Shakti which started 20 years ago. In the community the tradition still continues. Over the years there have been numerous workshops and training sessions given by therapists and trainers from other countries, India is not unknown as it was 20 years ago. The prime therapy, is still given main importance, the attachment therapy. This enables those lacking security to emerge from their hurt and crippled personalities. This enables a person to reach out to trust, and become responsible for self and become an independent person. In this treatment process strong relationships are formed. The community has become a living source of relationship as all members, those in the Hulimavu community and the extended community, enjoyed sustaining and rewarding relationships that they have formed within the community. Last evening I had a call from Ghorakpur from Mohan, who is one of the kids here at the beginning. There are many people who still remember those first days we had. So, why, I wonder, give an idea of myself, what am I about, what is my motivation, what am I doing with myself? We have to reflect, view ourselves, and get back to the desires that make us happy. So, each of us with renewed vigor and zeal to work, we get people moving, seeing and loving the world. We need to have people see the world, see it and love it and renew their contact. So they enjoy being in a really worldwide community and simultaneously a local network of friends. Always a local community seeking to serve others across the world. All of us we share, we interact and we talk. They had this meeting with 400 Jesuits from all over the world. They spent 3 months talking and discussing, and this is what they came up with. They emphasized the startling reality of God’s love, that we all are made for love, however we express that acceptance and love to each other. I would question how much trouble you have in believing that you have been loved, or that you are being loved today.</p>
<p>When I speak of spirit, what is this spirit? It is deeper than your thoughts and deeper than your feelings. This is the spirit, that’s deep within you. The mind and the heart within are the essentials of life. What gives that life to mind and the heart is the spirit. The spirit will make us open to love. Situation is so simple, no excuse needed, no complications but we have to keep open and trusting. The contract requires us to act as a group with a universal mission, realizing at the same time the diversity of our situations, it is a world wide community, and simultaneously with a network of local communities. We seek to serve the communities across the world. Our mission is a safe endeavor in a chosen place open to follow the gift of justice for all. We must see it as a unified home in which we depend upon each other, globalization technology and environmental concerns, that challenge our traditional boundaries and have made us look, work, we share our boundaries. Our hands have increased our awareness and we bear a common responsibility to the welfare of the entire world and its development in a sustainable living and giving way.</p>
<p>To live this mission, we have to do this work , in our broken world, we need to turn on our brotherly spirit. I have a room in Mount St.Joseph’s across the road that’s where I go and enjoy a familiar folk community, in which we nourish and express with great intensity, so much passion, that will unify our differences and bring to life our creativity. I can go anywhere in the world and I can see my community welcome me and share with me. In our training program, this is the way I put it. But here in Athma Shakti we have to lead the kids to be able to lead a normal life, that which fits for them although they may have to struggle to feel at ease.</p>
<p><span>We have to lead the kids to join in the social network, so to be with others, with some sort of ease and comfort, to know their needs in a social setting. Our community has already a social setting, and members have the ability to ask, understand, discuss, accept, see the benefit, realize where they are coming from, and whether the difficulties can be rightfully and beneficially expressed, in their thinking, can they realize how difficulties can be resolved. The person intelligently realizes, that I will always have social needs, and I am grateful for having my social needs including the need to talk to others, the need to help others. We have to be grateful because these needs lead us to come into sharing contact with others, to be with others and grow with others. These social needs that I have cause me to observe, be aware and realize so that these needs can be fulfilled. God presents us with the needs, the way we grow and experience ourselves in a certain way. Human beings have ease as they share with others We can not exist by ourselves. Because it is in the mutual observation we become aware and realize that our needs can be fulfilled, that we need to be with others, learn from others, enjoy being with others. Once you appreciate your needs, and experience having them fulfilled and satisfied, you appreciate the goal of a meeting. Why am I talking to you ? We have to rejuvenate, energize the present. We need to leave the past community and move along with the community that beckons us. Remember we are never alone, we may be sitting doing nothing, not talking to anybody but we are not alone ever. You have a duty to be with others, to react and enjoy with each of the member of the community, all of us, each one of us being a moving effective person. I need not use any fancy words. We are created to be effective persons in getting our needs met, effective in forming and enjoying our relationships with others, learning to love and to have a beautiful living experience of being loved by others, so that each of us can grow, become independent, enjoy being the persons we are, able to make attachments, being supported in our attachments, through our attachments growing in insights, understanding attachment, understanding our need for being attached, our need for being able to love others and by being able to love ourselves we recognize the feelings we are experiencing, and the love, the purpose and meaning of each and every feeling that I have. All that comes into my conscious life, realizing the reason for any feeling coming into my consciousness and how that particular feeling is enabling me to reflect on my present attitude towards myself and towards other persons and in this manner directing me to think necessary thoughts so that I can guide myself in my own awareness of myself. I may guide others by the directions that are open and accepted by me to take the steps which would bring me to a sense of my work for myself, and my work for other people, good activity for all of us, all that takes place in our world, each one for ourselves and for other people, whether it is father, mother, brother sister, family, relationships friends, you know that’s how human life goes. Firstly awareness of the feelings of a little one month old child enabled to find a satisfying, pleasant feeling, realizing he can make moves to bring him back those feelings, the cause and effect, this causes this, this causes that, the cause is not outside, the cause is within me seemingly within my body mind, not from outside. I can change the awareness and avoid those feelings that seem to bring me discomfort. Some remain with me causing me discomfort and I do not feel I have the need to equip to escape from those negative experiences and they remain with me and I do not realize they are negative experiences and are going to remain within myself and may cause so many hesitations and dissatisfying moments in my life. It is only later or hopefully or fortunately, at some favored moments in my life, another person seems to accept me and understands in some manner that I can not explain. That this person accepts me even though I am coming from my negative experiences and may even struggle to avoid the person but as I speak with the person and draw </span>a comfort from the person I find a trust in myself, and a growing belief that I can find meaning and happiness in my life. That a person may provide that transforming process is what we may go through here, in this building, in these rooms, the living room and dining room, badminton court, that’s what we are doing, be aware of our negative feelings, and be willing to talk about any negative thoughts and feelings. Everybody needs to talk about and free oneself. That has to be, because to observe and to realize that their needs can be fulfilled, our kids need to learn the skills of communication, of interacting with others, of understanding others, helping others as they learn the skills of communication, as they become aware that it is impossible to find ease and comfort in being a person who is not sharing with others. The person needs to control themselves so that they can easily and actively think and express themselves clearly and intelligently with other people. We have a strategy for producing anything in life, feelings of love, attraction, deeper relations, decisions, whatever. If we discover our strategy for loving, we can trigger that state as well. If we are thinking and trying to decide whether to speak to another person or trying to decide whether to ask them something or not, then we become decisive in a matter of minutes but we have to keep active, rely on our habits, the learning and habits from the past. In some manner express ourselves as we wish and share with others clearly and intelligently. In Athma Shakti we have the methodology that will give any person the ability to communicate to his or her own satisfaction at the satisfactory hours, a methodology that enables the living relationships to be established and enhanced, that is what living life is all about. It is becoming free, within myself, free to use myself, to understand others, to share with others, and to hear from others. All of us need to imagine how we can create our future, well that is what we want our kids to do, and help other people create their future. This is what we want our kids to do, create, freely fit into, develop, open, that there is a future for me. That each of us has to create a future for ourselves. I mentioned the beginnings of my life. I would like to begin reflecting, what is the interior self within me, aware of, my desire, how is it guiding me for peace and meaning in all that I do. Do I have peace? peace meaning I am happy. What is my vision, what is the purpose of ASV, what is our mission. How do we rate ourselves and say that we are set for ourselves, moving for ourselves. How do we belong? How do we know we are learning? We have to be open to discussion, get any feedback, we have to get ourselves moving.</p>

 		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Training Program - Voice recording 007 </h2>
<p><span class="big-letter">N</span>ow let us go back to beginning. We have to begin from the beginning, for each and every person who has been mentally ill, there has been a beginning, of the illness. Very much that we will be talking about in this book will be the beginning of the history of each and every person that has been connected to Athma Shakti. We will need to talk about the individual who has been with us in the community in the past; in the present the people have come to Athma Shakti looking for something that could enable them to live their lives with other people. When a patient first cames to Athma Shakti, he/she will be experiencing loneliness, difficulty in their contact with other people or any type of relationship with other people.</p>
<p>Most people who have come and spent time in Athma Shakti have been brought here by parents and relatives and most have come after being spent some years of treatment with a psychiatrist or psychiatrists or being in hospitals. They come to us really with great difficulty because they cannot be with other people, they cannot function with other people. In a way they cannot understand themselves. Why do they behave like this? It is difficult for them to reflect upon themselves and decide how they want to react, what they want or even ask themselves what can I do? In the circumstances in which they find themselves, they don’t experience they have feelings, often those feelings are very negative feelings. I feel happy and I feel good are the feelings so very important to us. In a way they guide us, in a way they give us, enable us that there is some meaning in our lives because of the feelings.</p>
<p>What is the role of those feelings in our lives? If we would not have those feelings, how would we guide ourselves? How would we choose what would we like to have? The awareness enables us to be conscious of those feelings we are experiencing within ourselves at anytime. So, they are necessary to be with us or our life from the moment we are born even before we are thinking we have feelings. Slowly as a very young infant we begin to realize we have feelings.</p>
<p>We begin to look at the reasons why we have those feelings that we have. That brings us to be obedient to thinking and to look at the reason the thinking has to do with the reasons for our feelings. But as we think over these feelings, we begin to decide certain ways of behaving we do which gives us the good feeling and try to avoid what gives us the negative feelings and then we begin to take charge of ourselves and our personalities and we decide what will help us to avoid the sadness.</p>
<p>Yes, we find some reasons why we are afraid What we must do to avoid being afraid? <strong>Must do </strong>word seems to be some sort of command. So, we find within ourselves there is this command structure. Something that tells us, something that commands us what to do. So, now we will be coming to these feelings and then thinking about those feelings, then the command structure tells us what to do. So, those really basic visions take place within ourselves. So, as we live each day, live the day with these feelings, attitudes and the beliefs. Attitudes and beliefs are those things, sort of through which we guide ourselves. We form these sorts of guide notes.</p>
<p>We are told in certain ways in the beginning of our lives by our parents, to feel positive within ourselves and through that they guide us so that we are able to control our feelings and avoid negative feelings, but we are free to make changes within ourselves. This is what Athma Shakti is all about, the ability to be able to change myself, so that I change my thinking, or I change my feelings or attitude or belief and extract freedom that is necessary for us if we are to live a happy and meaningful life. We want to have that and we want to experience that happiness. And that is the goal of our lives as a human person, justifying towards that happiness. So we have parents, the parents who have given us the life we have and who wish us to have a good and a happy life, the life that is fulfilling for us, the life that is meaningful for us. We in the beginning may feel very uneasy to accept the guidelines that my parents give me and yet over the years it gives me the sense and happiness that I experience in my life.</p>
<p>So, I need to learn what causes me to have various feelings that I have. Finding out what feeling I have, I have to then look at them and study so that I can discover what causes me to have those feelings that I have. Especially the negative feelings so often that most of life I have to be questioning and find out what causes me to have those unpleasant feelings. I need to admit to myself that I have negative feelings and question myself as to why I am having these negative feelings and anger. Sometimes when I want something and I am not getting it I will be angry. I have to make a big effort to study why I am having this anger. What is the reason? Why does it bother me? It is causing me trouble and what can I do to be rid of it? Many times young people come here and they are quite angry and they are afraid of their difficulty in meeting and talking with people. They feel often they are helpless that they cannot do anything to break out of the anger or fear. No one seems to be there to esolve this and that is where we at Athma Shakti work to bring the individual to realize the negative feelings that they are having and through our efforts bring them to discover the reasons why they are having these negative feelings. And when they recognize these negative feelings, we can help them to change.</p>
