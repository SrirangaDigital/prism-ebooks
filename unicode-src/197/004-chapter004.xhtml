		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>address this letter to all friends and members of our extendedIcommunity of Athma Shakti Vidyalaya.</p>
		<p>We had the house-warming and dedication of our new home on June 21, 1998. Everything went well on that day. We had lunch for 300 people. I thought people might be interested in the words which I said as we made the dedication of this, our new home.</p>
		<p>I will always be grateful as will many others for all your care and support over the years. Thanks.</p>
		<p><em>…..And so we come to our dedication of this building – <br />We dedicate ourselves with this building <br />as it becomes the home of a community being built <br />with living stones – <br />we are united with others around the world <br />as we do whatever we can to make this world one living <br />community of acceptance and love. </em></p>
		<p class="text-right"><strong>Date : January 10, 2005 </strong></p>
		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>begin this letter at the beginning of 2005 with various thoughts and feelings coming up in my mind, together with many worries, some encouragements, legitimate doubts and creative ideas. There is always much to be considered and ofcourse, our starting point is always the past and the possible future. As we reflect we become aware of the accompanying feelings, positive and negative, that give us the insights and direction that enable us to build up our lives. I hope that we, all of us in any way attached to Athma Shakti, will be aware and supportive of those decisions we need to take, to enhance our own individual lives and the lives of all those who share our world.</p>
		<p>In our present review we register the thoughts of thanksgiving and gratitude for the year 2004, a year that gave us the opportunity to celebrate the 25 years we have dedicated to the rewarding task of enabling meaningful mental health and productive living for all of us. In 2004 we had some kids move out to work and support themselves. One or two did training courses. And then we had others join the community. The present kids in the community are much involved in developing their strengths and capabilities.</p>
		<p>There are two goals of 2005 I would like to see fulfilled. One is to have the second floor of our building completed so that we have more space and the kids are more comfortable in their rooms. The second is to set up a definite training program based on our methodology that we can offer to interested persons who have some interest in the field of mental health and psychotherapy. Hopefully these two goals can be fulfilled this year.</p>
		<p>Along with these, I would personally like to concentrate on one specific area of rehabilitation, that I consider the necessary first step in gaining or regaining mental health. We need many different words to help us describe this simple goal, or rather intervention, leading to the goal of being able to function independently and always responsibly in life. If I would put it simply, I believe that all people in the mental health field and that is all of us, realize the essential step needed to be taken by the disturbed person. That small but often frightening step is to be open, to trust, or relate, or deeply connect with another person. We are talking here about a simple, inner decision made on the basis of a trustful experience that in fact cannot be fully explained, but also cannot be fully denied.</p>
		<p>I refer to a very definite, real action that takes place within a person that leads to a realization that this small act of trust is worthwhile, as in meaning, opens up something, lifts something, makes existence lighter – we could go through many words but still not give an apt description or understanding of this experience – for it is often an experience that will not be understood, it just is there and it feels good.</p>
		<p>Many young people with mental health problems can carry on many pursuits. They might study, learn to be efficient on a computer, go shopping, can sing, can dance, but cannot appreciate their interaction with another person. They cannot or will not set aside their own feelings and attitudes and beliefs or intentions in order to understand in a meaningful manner the feelings and attitudes that are being expressed by the other person, even though the other person is doing their best to support them and be of assistance to them. They never experience or seriously acknowledge a compassion, a kindness. They find quite impossible a willingness to adjust to the other because they unconsciously at some period in the distant past have decided that they are alone and must stay alone for their own well being or safety. For them in their protective outlook the world is not kind and the persons they have to deal with in the world are not kind.</p>
		<p>The person with serious mental problems has a serious difficulty, almost an impossibility of making the different interactions in life fit significantly together for him or her. So, it is up to those who can make sense out of life to reach out to the mentally ill with compassion, gentleness, understanding, patience and quiet firmness. Yes, it is almost as if you are attempting to have a small child understand. Usually the child will understand you because he or she might unknowingly trust you in some way. So, our task is to find some natural and reliable intervention that will bring the mentally ill to a point where they will decide to trust, to trust at least one person so fully that they can be lead out of the labyrinth they seem to be lost in.</p>
		<p>We are a charitable registered society operating a therapeutic community, often referred to as a rehabilitation centre. We have a license granted by the local district commissioner. This license comes under the Mental Health Act of 1985 .There are many centers for the mentally ill which have been functioning for over 20 years and whose custodial care and treatment is highly appreciated by the resident’s family.</p>
		<p>Besides all this I would ask you to keep me informed of your thinking about Athma Shakti concerning any helpful ideas you may have and what you may wish or require from us.</p>

		<p class="text-right"><strong>26th September ‘05 </strong></p>
		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>have not written a letter to parents and friends of Athma Shakti Vidyalaya for many months. Time slips by, we let it go, and miss out on the contacts that we could have had with each other. I have been slow in keeping up the contacts and relationships that are so necessary for each and every one of us. I am renewing, seems I am always renewing. Of course if there always is a real renewal I will be gaining, and any gain will be a boon for me.</p>
		<p>When visitors enquire about the latest events of my life and the special breakthroughs. I tell them I have become personally committed. Then I point to the reason for the commitment, a real living reason they will have already encountered at the door in the form of big black frisky Alsatian. Imagine friends giving a huge animal to a 75 year old man on his birthday. However they can be excused because when they handed me this gift, he fit snugly in the palm of one of my hands. So, I have had a very happy companion with me, a transformed companion who had to be quietly lead through the eight month transformation into a quiet pet. Having my big bounding fourlegged friend around was not to everybody’s liking in the community so he had to learn to restrict his playfully taking a person’s arm between his teeth, realize how long his tail is so he doesn’t brush faces as he walks by people sitting on mattresses in the living room and that there are only a select few willing and allowed to give him strokes. Now, I have an obedient companion with me during my morning’s long walk, one who will sit and reluctantly lay down on command, even roll over and play dead for the trainer. Because of him I had dropped my habit of taking two nights off each week. Now, I know he will be no trouble if I take time off. He will give me permission to have time off.</p>
		<p>Enough of my dog story. He sits with me in my office and when I am in groups, as last evening when I sat with the kids for my regular Sunday evening chat. I suppose I can call it a chat although sometimes it is more of a lecture or quiet exhortation. I like to have a topic suggested by the group. Usually it is a topic that relates to therapy. Last evening we ended up looking at “reluctance” an important word in therapy.</p>
		<p>I used the word reluctance, an acceptable word, that fits easily with the condition or place that some of the group audience find themselves in at present although they most often have reluctance to admit that they have a reluctance to accept that their problem seems to centre around a reluctance. Could we not say that much of the psychological problems that individuals have is simply that – a reluctance to admit a reluctance? Nice words to describe a miserable, wretched, firm condition. For that is what it is. The condition is firm, it is closed off, lacks any movement to be free, a fear of movement, an understandable fear but still a fear that blocks movement to wellness. The perceived misery causes anger, yet denies the deeper real causes of the anger. So, it remains. And it is wretched because the sad, melancholy person suffers in this condition of reluctance. At some level he or she wishes the troubles would just disappear.</p>
		<p>From my experience I would say this experience is very common with people with psychological problems whether they have slight problems or full-blown mental illness. The first question I ask of parents or someone making enquiries about placing someone in ASV, concerns the ill person’s realization and understanding of their problem and their motivation. All of us have personal problems some less, some more than others. If we are to have a happy and meaningful life of relationships with other people it is necessary that we be conscious and aware of the bumps and humps of our inner life, of our personality. By being conscious of the difficulties we experience within ourselves, and as we make the required efforts to resolve those difficulties, we actively and continuously further our inner peace. Our inner peace leads to relationships. A healthy inner life enables us to initiate and continue relationships with persons. We are persons born with the wherewithal to live a life of relationships with other persons. But that wherewithal is delicate. Made up of so many factors, it is the gift that makes our life more beautiful, causes us to write poetry, to make marvelous paintings, to wonder, to perceive, to understand, to choose, to value, to love.</p>
		<p>Our peace, our happiness in relationships with others depends first and foremost on our acceptance that any negative experiences that disturb us can be examined, understood, judged and resolved. All this depends on our inner freedom, our greatest gift, our willingness to question our own experience of self. This freedom is always with us, but perhaps the personal gift most easy to deny. It seems very odd but people with serious mental problems often deny this gift of freedom in the name of freedom. They can deny this most essential gift by claiming some sort of inner freedom that is not free; it is some sort of closed determination, some sort of obsession, causing the person to claim a pernicious isolation. Some people may lightly call that reluctance. A nice word, but the reality may keep many people ill. We need to realize that we must maintain the true reality of our freedom whatever the cost, because this freedom keeps me questioning, keeps me healthy. This freedom empowers me to reflect, to perceive what is real, to understand what is real, to listen to others, reflect on advice given to me, to choose what is the best choice to make at the present moment in my search for supportive relationships, for love.</p>
		<p>Many things can go wrong if we lose or reject that freedom, lose that freedom to listen, to understand, to weigh all the factors in the situation. One of the kids in the discussion last evening said, “Yes, we must keep wanting what we want, so that we can want what we want”. She is referring to the two year old’s stance, “Give me what I want, no questions asked”. Yes, she in her life has wanted just what she wanted and did what she wanted, all of which has resulted in humiliation, great pain and unhappiness.</p>
		<p>Or we are afraid to use that freedom, we are reluctant to decide to make a change or move within the orbit of our thinking, our feelings, attitudes or beliefs. In my experience this reluctance that keeps many individuals blocked in what they say, others say, is their problem. The unwillingness to let go or to shift their attitude keeps many trapped. Often I have had the experience that visitors who come to ASV find that we are over demanding, too demanding, on the persons here for treatment. We must make the demands, for most often these persons are quite reluctant to make the necessary healthy demands on themselves. They have no idea that they can use (athma shakti) their freedom, activate their freedom, give up their reluctance, and in the process come to a new view and realization of the negative experience they are having. This is a very simplistic way of describing this immense struggle that the person with mental ill health goes through. Yet I believe that this is the route they must be open to take. There is no other road except being aware of thinking, and facilitative deciding.</p>
		<p>Here at ASV they are never asked to do this alone, no therapist would ever ask a person to choose without bringing them first to some knowledge and insight of just where the limitation is, for example, where their feelings may be contaminating their thinking, keeping them locked up in anger or fear. They are given the acceptance and understanding needed to support them. In many cases this personal acceptance and mutual understanding continues lifelong.</p>
		<p>I have sketchily described one process of getting well, and the reason for the existence of ASV. This process has given me happiness over the years, as I have been with people going through it. The reluctance is understandable, but the reluctance can be a barrier on the road to wellness. We can use many other words to describe the basic difficulty individuals have, and refer to other behaviors, not so acceptable as the word reluctance, but the process and outcome is the same. Each individual must find and act on with their freedom, no matter how much reluctance they may experience within their personality.</p>
		<p>The community goes on as usual. At sometimes the atmosphere is bright and active, at other times a bit heavy like the dark monsoon clouds hovering above us. Often, the situation is the result of the dynamics I was referring to in the sentences above. Some of the kids are busy using their inner freedom so they are not stuck in the negative feelings that have bugged them for a long time, others are reluctant to trust that if they let go of their old burdensome negative beliefs, they will find a new experience in their living with themselves. Then comes the question how to convince them to let go. I believe that many of you probably have experienced how difficult or even impossible the convincing can be. Still the impossible can be made possible, especially through relationships, the reason we have a therapeutic community.</p>
		<p>There have been good initiatives in the community in the form of discussions on some planning for the future; some planning being tentative, may be more than tentative; some serious talk on raising funds so we will be more comfortable and we can answer the needs of people coming to us for help. Any expansion in the future will mean funding that begins with at first finding out, sounding out the various possibilities.</p>
		<p>So, much to keep us energetically active and moving, as we remain earnestly searching for the effective process that enables persons to establish the renewed foundations of their psychological well being.</p>

		<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, a new year, a change of calendars, an exchange of good wishes, a hopeful look ahead. May all these activities lead us, each in his or her own way, on a move ahead. But remember we are not on a road. The road is not out there in front of us, for us to walk on or drive on. No the road ahead is going to be built in our spirit. In some way we lay down that road ahead by means of the experiences within our own spirit.</p>
		<p>What those experiences will be, and how we react to them depends on each of us. Mostly they will be of our own making. Sure we will be surrounded by many happenings and trends and so called breakthroughs, but as we go through the year these happenings can be seen as only the root cause of our experiences. We enhance and develop our experiences as we choose to react to all the influences , the pressures, the environments we continually find surrounding us. There is no running away, no escaping our living in this world given to us now. So, it is best that we stop and direct our minds, our hearts, our personalities in order to grow, to live, as we would prefer to live, to discover for ourselves our individual meaning as we go along day by day.</p>
		<p>This morning I was sitting quietly in my room for my usual meditative period after coming back from my morning walk with Kandu, my dog. Then I had a special thought about Kandu, he who teaches me always to expect something good to come along. He wakes me, expecting me to rise and take my walk with him, expecting me to give him a full meal when we get back, expecting me to play ball retrieving with him later in the day. What he expects usually happens. He trusts in his expectations, trusts that life is favorable to him and that he will be all right. Atleast he always seems to be expecting something to happen; may be this is because he is still young.</p>
		<p>But ourselves, what do we expect? Are we alive to expectations? I believe we all have expectations according to which we organize our thinking and our lives. We all want to move ahead and have a fulfilling, meaningful life. To have such a life comes about only as a result of our efforts, be they physical efforts or mental efforts or spiritual efforts. We all need to take care of our health so that we will be present to all the wonderful benefits coming into the world in the coming years. Hopefully we will always be desirous to keep learning all there is to learn in the various branches of knowledge concerning history, culture, science, and religion. We are all in some way or other on some sort of spiritual search to feel more secure within ourselves, more knowledgeable about what this whole life adventure is, more at peace with ourselves and others.</p>
		<p>We expect and want the world to be better, our experience of life to be more rewarding, happier. And at this time with the new year coming upon us, all of this comes to mind. But what effort do we really make within ourselves to make life better for ourselves? What will bring us greater enthusiasm for living, greater satisfaction with ourselves? All the pundits will tell us it is our own responsibility to bring all this about, to make it happen. And I guess it is.</p>
		<p>After being with so many people who are seeking more satisfaction in being the persons they would like to be, I believe that the key word in all of this is “relationship”, relationships of love. Let us skip the “love” word just now and concentrate on the “relationship” word. Many believe the discussion gets a bit “soupy” when you start speaking about “love” So stay with the idea that all of us have come into this world through relationships, find meaning in relationships, and find happiness in warm, solid relationships.</p>
		<p>My experience with the young people here for treatment in ASV is that all have or have had some problems with relationships Of course I might add that all of us being human find our relationships are often not as smooth as we would wish. One of the first indications of having emotional problems, serious emotional problems, is the withdrawal.</p>
		<p>The defenses the persons unconsciously set up for protection, keep them isolated within themselves often behind a wall of fear or anger, distant from caring others who would like to relate to them.</p>
		<p>To take a brief review of the news on the TV or in the newspapers, allow yourself to recognize that the news is again and again about broken relationships between states, groups of people, individuals. Notice the often-total lack of freedom to be open and adjust to others, the unwillingness to freely relate to others, freely open in trust and reciprocate the other’s concessions, interact and settle in shared understanding. And recognize the terrible human suffering that flows from this refusal to relate openly and with concern.</p>
		<p>So, how to cause a new year to happen, a real new year, one that is different? It is possible; this must be our belief, even though it goes against all the odds. All of us can believe that dependable relationships can come to exist. And a relationship has a strong element of faith, of belief. And also an important addition that needs to be added, hope. Each of us has to generate our own hope as we generate our own faith that life can be more fulfilling for us, richer in relationships.</p>
		<p>There is a phrase that I read each morning as I reflect on my own life. It gives me an impetus to renew my faith in my call. The phrase is “to make known…the loving- kindness in the heart of my God” I believe that the ability for any person to form relationships is engendered from the loving-kindness in his or her heart. That is in a way the main purpose of “Athma Shakti”, to enable all of us to live with greater loving-kindness in our hearts. Let us hope that our relationships may deepen and grow in the year 2006 so that the year may evolve in such a manner that more loving-kindness will be found in the hearts of all of us.</p>
		<p>Thanking you</p>

		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t has been a long time, many months, weeks gone and days.</p>
		<p>I have finally decided that I must communicate with persons outside of our compound walls </p>
		<p>Enough of an introduction. And with that I am brushing aside an admission that I have quietly reneged from taking the time to write. I have had lots of questions rising up in my awareness, lots of ideas to be squeezed for brilliant ideas, lots of intentions to be followed through on quietly, seriously. Sure, I know that I function best when I am aware and active with the usual result that unconsciously I begin to “make things happen”. From my experience of myself I realize that I am not much of a quiet “status quo” person. I wouldn’t have come around all the corners in my life had I been satisfied with letting the ball bounce along. I always wanted to dribble and kick it around – why one of my better ways of passing time not writing letters in the Past few months has been watching the Arsenal and Manchester United boot the ball around on a saturday afternoon.</p>
		<p>Be that as it is ,I have been at home in the community busy with the regular therapy sessions and group work and office work. I have done interesting reading from my favorite Ken Wilbur on our psychological, spiritual development from the womb to nirvana, and other various authors on the tremendously interesting interactions among the millions of cells in our brains. So much is known about our brain today. Yet many of us seem to be back with the primitives who did not know they could control their feeling reactions. In one of the books a neurobiologist described how much tremendous knowledge he learned from the brains of little chickens on how they learned to store information. How to handle all the wanted and unwanted, pleasant and unpleasant information stored in our brains, and bodies also, that is my concern, that is the engaging question. We can be happy, responsible, capable individuals or unhappy, depressed, prejudiced individuals. It is our choice.</p>
		<p>Let me quote a few sentences from one neurobiologist – “Experience is a term in the behavioural lexicon. Its translation in the language of biology is plasticity. To function effectively – that is to respond appropriately to its environment – all living organisms must show two contradictory properties. They must retain stability – specificity – during development and into adult life, resisting the pressures of the endless buffeting of environmental contingency, both today and over a lifetime. And they show plasticity – that is the ability to adapt and modify the specificity in the face of repeated experience…..To unravel the dialectic between specificity and plasticity and to understand its mechanisms form some major tasks to modern biology.”</p>
		<p>Status quo and change – makes our lives interesting, appealing, amusing and exciting – athma shakti.</p>
		<p>Now to some business. We have yet to move into the second floor. There a few adjustments to be done. The boys will move to the second floor. And the girls will have another room on their floor so there will be four in each room rather than six and the night staff rooms are much roomier. I will move back into the main building on the ground floor making a proper office for myself and a bedroom from the two crowded bedrooms the boys will happily vacate.</p>
		<p>With all the construction we now have four spacious bright rooms to be used, a room for computers, a new bright library, a room for formal psychophysical exercises, a room for any activities. Plus we have the large room above the present “living room” that could be used for meetings or courses or lectures. Come and see.</p>

		<p class="text-right"><strong>July, 2008 </strong></p>
		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t is Thursday – the 3rd of July and today I have finally found a good opportunity to share with you my reflections of the Parents’ Meeting that we came together for on Friday, the 27th of June. To have the meetings and some discussions is very educative and heartening for staff and kids and hopefully for you also. It is also informative and productive – necessary. For me it is experiential, so this experience must not be allowed to just vanish. Although it cannot really vanish since it has all been recorded in the cells of our bodies and more importantly in the grey cells in our skull (some scientists claim that they are also found throughout our body). Any experience remains with us and considering the amount of conscious or unconscious attention we, each of us, allow ourselves to pay to the experience, it will be a means of deepening our understanding of ourselves and an invitation we may give to our personality, our ego or our self to find a deeper meaning in being the person each of us believes himself or herself to be and in living the life we want to live.</p>
		<p>From the feedback some of you have given me this meeting has been rated the most useful, most effective, worthwhile and beneficial, that we have had so far. I felt fairly pleased with the atmosphere we engendered together concerning this important concern we all have –energetic functioning of all persons connected in any manner with Athma Shakti.</p>
		<p>Still I wish my own rating of the meeting could have been higher, more to what I would have preferred. After reflection my rating was somewhere in the range of 35% to 40% on the categories that come to mind now –participation, depth of sharing, creativity, surprise, wonder. These categories just spring up before me now as I write. So, let me attempt to explain to myself what I mean by each of them.</p>
		<p><strong>Participation – </strong>yes, as a member of the community, at a particular encounter of a special, specific community, where each person with equal rights and duties could open themselves or herself to be ready to acquire important insights concerning self, son or daughter, brother, sister, resident here in the community. With this happening through the evolving meaningful, intellectual engagement we have had together, everyone had an opportunity to advance their facility in expressing their needs and desires, and at the same time establishing an agreeable manner of relating to each other, something that may not have been possible at home in the past. Through the growth of trust that our kids have hopefully assimilated within this community, they will take the opportunity to venture to experience some tentative ability to relate more meaningfully to one other person or to many others. Through this continually growing skill in communication, ease and awareness in developing some sort of self-transcendence with others, he or she will then allow their self to actualize the meaning of their life.</p>
		<p><strong>Sharing </strong>– In the sharing comes the actualization of self. Our life from the very beginning is a process of becoming more alive. We are born having tremendous potentialities. One philosophy that comes from the Europe of seven or eight hundred years ago, and which I had to study fifty years ago uses different ideas to describe this situation. It is based on two concepts or words – “Act” and “Potency”. These are two simple words but they define life and existence. We might surmise that the divine is purely act without needing any potency. As such the divine enlivens us as spirits but not as pure spirits but spirits living in a body. As humans our life actually exists as an indestructible spiritual life which we live in a physical body with the ability to think, reason, decide, choose and love. When born the human person has life and this life is pure potency to take a decision, to decide, to choose, to act, to love. Our whole life after that is based on or built, composed of or formed or directed by the choices we make. Even the small infant reacts when it finds itself comfortable or not comfortable, hungry or not. When we make a choice, we bring into energy or act the potency we are energizing. In this way we are responsible for all the life strength we cause to enter and energize our life. Another way of speaking on this is to say that we begin with a “tabla rasa” - a blank sheet with nothing on it. And as we choose we fill it. Actualization is at the core of the treatment in Athma Shakti. Each and every person has the opportunity through their choices to actualize themselves – become as they wish to be, as they need to be. The crux of the problem is in the ability to be aware of one’s potencies and the choice to energize them or not. A person needs to be aware and concerned as to which potencies have special value and meaning for them. These need to be brought into act. A person has the potency to accept what the other says, consider it, and not automatically actualize their anger. I have the potency to accept my fear, examine it, study it, and then only act, to withdraw or go ahead, to express myself, fight with you or agree with you. I have the potency to love or not to accept the love offered to me. Meanwhile all the while I need to keep examining whether the reasons for my choices are sensible and valid or not. If I stay stubborn and refuse to admit that I always have a choice I will have difficulties in relationships with other persons. I can refuse to think, refuse the offered help, or the offered love or the love given in reality. I can always, always act differently, refuse the offered interest or care or love. I could fall into the trap of losing friends and becoming isolated, and further along down the line, perhaps become neurotic, psychotic, or eventually suffer some form of mental illness.</p>
		<p><strong>Creativity </strong>- When my potencies are all open, I can create a life for myself. I am not tied down by my past choices, my past acts, the decisions I took about myself and other people up to the present day. When creative I will be open to all the many potentialities I have at the present time. Psychotherapy’s main thrust is to help a person to be open, to discover, see, accept, understand, and actualize the potencies he or she has to become the person he or she wants to be and that others want him or her to be, especially those who offer him or her their love.</p>
		<p><strong>Surprise </strong>- The surprise comes from the new experience when I follow through on my potencies, through my openness to others, through speaking about myself, through sharing with others, I will experience my freedom to be the person I want to be – a well thought out freedom that can bring me happiness. As I stay with this realization of my inner freedom to be this person I want myself to be, I will realize my self transcendence, my openness and trust in another person, all of which will give meaning to my life. Hopefully all of us at sometime have been surprised as this built-in potency has awakened in us. Many, because of some unhappy happening cannot allow this potency to arise into action. However, this built-in potency will allow me to move or move me or incite me to be open to relate closely to other persons, and hopefully to accept and to deeply trust and love one or two other persons. All of human relating comes as an answer to this built-in potency we are born with. Some people because of some tragic experience, that may have lodged in their unconsciousness, will not put this potency into act. They remain separate, aloof, tied up within their own self, unable to trust,or form a relationship. Truly tragic. They miss the wonderful surprises embedded in living life.</p>
		<p><strong>Wonder</strong>- because many of us missed the abundant sharing and interaction that we could have had, we miss out on the experience of wonder. Why wonder? “Wonder”, a very important word but often difficult to distinctly explain. For me, the word seems to have some relationship to the word “spirit”. Wonder will often cause us to reach out, to explore, to take a chance, all actions that move us to renew our trust to find some new meaning in our lives. We should never neglect the wonder that can be spawned as we stay open to new possibilities, to newness. When wonder is present persons who may have had difficulty controlling feelings or have lost the meaning of their life, through the experience of wonder may discover potencies they never realized within themselves. How do we assist a person classified as having serious psychological problems to accept their predicament and take responsibility for their present thinking or their refusing to think concerning their relations with others? For a solution to that question we on our part must fall back on our own gift of wonder. I believe that psychotherapy has a strong base or foundation in wonder. I find in my interviews with prospective clients that the family or friends have often come after years of staying with the same dull thoughts and conclusions about the situation without any explorative wonder concerning what could be a solution. We have to keep wondering and wondering with a purpose. Can we envisage a process of healing? In our search we can always wonder what procedures we might find to activate the rationality and understanding that the person possesses. Could we speculate and conjecture concerning what could be possible, and instill some wonder to fascinate a person to some new thinking? How to incite some positive motivation in the person? Through wonder we can shift our potency into act.</p>
		<p>When I began this letter I had no thought of writing so extensively. My one aim was to thank you for coming and for your interacting with us, and taking part in the discussions. Because I could not meet some of you before you left and so could not discuss with you your reactions and your thinking about the day, I would appreciate it if you send me, how you felt about the day. I need to know your reactions. Otherwise I am left a vacuum.</p>
		<p>I consider it most important and essential that you keep reflecting on your thinking and feelings if you expect that your son or daughter is to emerge out of the problems that burden them – and have burdened them for many, many long years. I believe that mental illness can be explained and understood. All family members will be in some manner involved in that sorting out. Mental illness is not purely chemical. When I change my beliefs and attitudes, my outlooks and wishes, I make chemical changes in my physical brain. We may never fully understand the full details of any person’s psychological or spiritual lack of growth. But we need to stay aware within ourselves as someone close to us becomes more rational, takes more responsibility, becomes more conscious of self and more capable of relating with others, especially important others. Many phone their son or daughter hoping there may be small changes in the person, without realizing that they themselves are coming from the same mindset of many years ago. We all of us must expect more evident changes. We must be living for and with changes – that is being alive and enjoying life. Remember we must try everything possible to enable each of us to live a more meaningful prolific, resonating life. We must have courage, willingness, openness to do what is possible in the moves that we are making for mental health, for the advancement and maturation of meaningful human relationships. We need to expect much of each other and constantly look for breakthroughs and renewals.</p>
		<p>I have gone on and on and may have written what may be considered a long, complicated treatise. May be I can take another time to put this in a simpler more understandable direct style. I thank you for your patience, your interest and your determination to stay in this quest with us here. I remain with you always, open to your feedback.</p>
		<p>Thanking you</p>

		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>ime goes by and goes by. I realize that I have not written a letter to parents and guardians after the last Parent’s Meeting which we had in I believe sometime at the end of August. Time goes by so quickly and I struggle along hoping that something is accomplished.</p>
		<p>Now we are in the age of “change”. The word that Obama has used to mesmerize the world and caused us to realize that we are alive and given the grace to exist today. And in my opinion he has definitely given us a most challenging word, a word under Obama’s inspiration has become for the entire world a challenge to wake up and bring forth the changes each of us discovers that will enable us to build a unified, accomplishable world in which we can share. “Yes, we can”.</p>
		<p>I view it all as so beautiful, so enthralling, so captivating yet freeing, and I believe all of us were so happy to be alive in the present and in the days to come. The experience brought each of us lifted higher, and immensely increased the inviting opportunities for relationships to be established or continued.</p>
		<p>We have so much to be thankful for. We live in a world of opportunity.</p>
		<p>So, now let us allow ourselves to face the basics. Especially now that we may be more willing to face the basics and find our way through to the role of relationships in our lives. I have written a bit about relationships in previous letters and wish to continue somewhat in this letter.</p>
		<p>I begin by a quote by Dr. Raj Persaud who wrote a book, The Motivated Mind, How to get what you want from life. In his preface he writes: “My clinical practice as a psychiatrist today is, much more psychological than it is strictly medical. As a result of my student psychology days, I retain a healthy skepticism of the medical model as a frame of mental illness, which often produces conflict between myself and medical colleagues at the Maudsley Hospital and The Institute of Psychiatry.”</p>
		<p>He spends a few pages of his book talking about relationships “One of the first development tasks that children face is learning to feel related and connected to others, while also recognizing that they have perspectives and emotions distinct from their parents. Unfortunately not all parents support a child’s developing autonomy and desire for relatedness’’.</p>
		<p>In a therapeutic community such as ours, the first and main aim of treatment is to establish some kind of secure attachment, since that is basic if a person is to benefit from being present in a therapeutic community. The attachment can then make it possible for changes to happen in the deeply ingrained expectations of relationships and patterns of behaviour.</p>
		<p>When a person becomes more social, and this does not happen automatically for the person has to struggle between his very neediness on one side and his fear of being angrily rejected – a struggle he may have had to deal with in the past. So, the need of forming one or a few positive open relationships that will have a therapeutic value. In the community the person may be able to form real relationship contacts and so break through the unfinished business of the past contacts. Without the person even being aware he may be expressing what was lacking in his past through his current conscious emotional struggles. Living and reciprocal relationships provide acceptance, affirmation of a person’s individuality. They provide an experience of being linked being together and involved. They provide an opportunity to experience one’s effect on another person, as also the occasional moments of tension that come along and that could lead to a break or a problem solved. Yes, I believe forming a strongly affirmative, free yet demanding, rewarding relationship with another person is necessary if a person in the community is to move on and successfully live a happy, meaningful life. May all of our kids come to live such a life,</p>

		<p class="text-right"><strong>October 24, 2009 </strong></p>
		<p>Dear Friends,</p>
		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> begin (as I begin so many letters lately) by apologizing for not keeping better contact with you over the months. I have not written any common letters, nor any individual letters to you for some months. In fact I have been something that could be described as the dry well in the wilderness – dry, not supplying the reviving sustenance needed by the travelers on their journey across the parched landscape. We are all travelers, and we all need sustenance, be it in quenching our thirst or in knowing about the store of refreshing news ahead of us.</p>
		<p>It is my duty to apologize to you for not offering you at least a few positive thoughts from time to time so that the well of your interest in the psychological aspects of human life does not grow completely dry. You might consider and ascertain what is the “well of your interest”. Let us go a bit deeper, a little further. Lately I have delved deeply into a learned book I have been reading and ruminating – a very special book on spirituality. Really it is a deep theoretical and psychological study of the teachings of another book, a little book which turned my life around almost 60 years ago. That little book of instructions for a thirty day series of practices of reflection, medication and review of life caused me to change my life completely. It affirmed many truths that led me to be more aware of myself, and to understand my meaning discovered by opening out my inner self transcendence. And that opened not a little “well” for me but launched me on a continuous ocean of self discovery and growth. “Self- transcendence”, I know I am springing a new word on you there, it is an important word.</p>
		<p>The book I have been reading has this to say – “He (Lonergan) went on to describe the stages one passes through in becoming an authentic human being. “Man’s development,” he wrote is “a matter of getting beyond himself, of transcending himself, of ceasing to be an animal in a habitat and of becoming a genuine person in a community”. Development occurs, he said in successive stages by which an individual attends to the data of his life, makes sense of it through understanding and judgment, and after deliberation reaches decisions and takes action.”</p>
		<p>The book I mentioned has caused me to reflect on my inner life of prayer and medication and it would be interesting to talk about, but now I want to talk about the past few months. My attendance in September at a conference of counselors and psychotherapists who were interested in learning and being trained in the theories and practices of Transactional Analysis brought me back to my organizing the beginnings of Athma Shakti. This conference was a six day conference in Calicut in Kerala that Anando, and I attended. It was a conference on Transactional Analysis, a system of explaining the psychology of the human personality in simple concepts developed by Eric Berne in the United States back in the 1960s. After I came to Bangalore in 1978 I gave many two-day sessions teaching the concepts and practice of Transactional Analysis and it was our primary frame of reference when we began ASV. I am still often invited to make presentations at TA conferences.</p>
		<p>This time the organizers had given this title to our full day presentation – “Experiential Regressive Method of Psychotherapy” – what the organizers had made out of the information I had sent to them before the conference – “This workshop will present the methodology and language of Transactional Analysis as used in the rehabilitation of persons with serious mental problems at ASV… In an open and interactive setting we will present the original teachings of the Cathexis Reader on passivity, child development, frames of reference, redefining, reparenting and regression. A practical knowledge of all these ideas are necessary for therapists working with psychotics – and ordinary citizens as well.” May be at some of our parent’s meeting I can explain to you the meaning of all those words.</p>
		<p>I did enjoy those past days of presenting the theory and practice that we adopted in ASV. They were strong learning days. And I continue in the same creative process of directing young men and women in using this psychological approach in helping young people learn to function satisfactorily and responsibly in living their everyday lives.</p>
		<p>Although way back in 1979 we placed emphasis on adjusting to one another, living together and daily conducted the therapy by being together with the “kids” (as we have always called these young men and women). And even then we stressed that nobody overcomes their problem and gets well by themselves alone. In the past couple of years we have formalized this by stressing the fact that we are a community, really a “therapeutic community” a format that includes a definite process for the individual members.</p>
		<p>Because of this being active as a working community, competent in our communitarian approach we were easily accepted in to the Community of communities, a rehabilitation program initiated by the London School of Psychiatry. The founder of that program, Dr. Rex Haigh, had visited us and enjoyed spending time with us. However, although we carry on as an active therapeutic community we have not been able to extend our membership in the community of communities because we have not been able to cover the financial commitments. One of the specifications of the organization is that we pay the regular membership fee plus we have to send two staff of our community for a shared inspection to another community each year and invite two from another community to come to our community for inspection. On one occasion a community in England sent two members to us for mutual inspection and in another year a community from New Zealand sent three members over to inspect us. Those visits gave us great strength and recognition. There are over 30 community members in the community of communities. Being a member of a larger organization gives us the surety that we are using a methodology that has been validated many times over. Also we have the realization that we were not alone but involved in a world wide endeavor.</p>
		<p>I am enclosing with this letter the official statement on what is a therapeutic community and the core values of a therapeutic community.</p>
		<p><strong>What is a TC </strong></p>
		<p>Therapeutic communities are “psychologically informed planned environments” – they are places where the social relationships, structure of the day and different activities together are all deliberately designed to help people’s health and well being. In some communities, people with various longstanding emotional problems spend time and engage in therapy together in an organized and structured way, without drugs or self-damaging behaviour so that a new life in outside society is made possible. In other words people who cannot live normally in society (for reasons such as severe learning disability or persistent psychosis) engage in an interdependent form of group living which helps them to have a more fulfilling life and achieve their maximum social potential. The workings of the communities themselves are the main method, and through these social and group processes, change and growth are promoted.</p>
		<p><strong>Core Values<br /> CV1<br /> Attachment </strong></p>
		<p>Healthy attachment is a developmental requirement for all human beings, and should be seen as a basic human right.</p>
		<p><strong>CV2<br /> Containment </strong></p>
		<p>A safe and supportive environment is required for an individual to develop, grow or to change.</p>
		<p><strong>CV3 <br />Respect </strong></p>
		<p>People need to feel respected and valued by others to be healthy. Everybody is unique and nobody should be defined or described by their problems alone.</p>
		<p><strong>CV4<br /> Communication </strong></p>
		<p>All behaviour has meaning and represents communication which deserves understanding.</p>
		<p><strong>CV5<br /> Interdependence </strong></p>
		<p>Personal wellbeing arises from one’s ability to develop relationships which recognize mutual need .</p>
		<p><strong>CV6<br /> Relationships </strong></p>
		<p>Understanding how you relate to others and how others relate to you leads to better intimate, family, social and working relationships.</p>
		<p><strong>CV7<br /> Participation </strong></p>
		<p>Ability to influence one’s environment and relationships is necessary for personal well-being. Being involved in decision making is required for shared participation, responsibility and ownership</p>
		<p><strong>CV8<br /> Process </strong></p>
		<p>There is not always a right answer and it is often useful for individuals, groups and larger organizations to reflect rather than act immediately.</p>
		<p><strong>CV9<br /> Balance </strong></p>
		<p>Positive and negative experiences are necessary for healthy development of individuals, groups and the community.</p>
		<p><strong>CV10<br /> Responsibility </strong></p>
		<p>Each individual has responsibility to the group, and the group in turn has collective responsibility to all individuals in it.</p>
		<p>I believe that each and every one of these values is essential and it is important for us to stress these values in our therapy work. All of the values mentioned are important. If the young persons in our community are to come out of their mental problems here at ASV we have to give special attention to two of these specific core values, essential values. These are CV1 – Attachment and CV6 – Relationships. And we have to ascertain that all the other values are recognized and present within the community if our kids are to effectively and reliably develop into persons who understand, share and contribute to their living as responsible and happy individuals.</p>
		<p>I believe that it is the experience of most people that the person who is mentally ill has difficulty forming a strong, positive, healthy, meaningful attachment to another person, really finding meaning and solace in another person who accompanies them in their struggles. Or the mentally ill person may be on the opposite limit – show an over zealous dependency on self – not being open to any trust in another person. The person who is unable to be open to having an attachment to another person, often unknowingly and in an unconscious thrust mistakenly abandons or neglects his or her own healthy and appropriate concern for self. In depression or anger or fear, the person will be discounting self to his or her own detriment. Such a person will display in his or her conduct some amount of unconscious anger or resentment.</p>
		<p>Relationships with other persons, or a relationship with at least one person, brings a person the ability to share an existence, to share life, that is live by fulfilling the purpose of existence, to be ready and able to love others, and in turn to be open and desirous to receive love.</p>
		<p>In our presentation at the conference in Calicut, we presented the role of therapy as one of the essential elements of a therapeutic community. The notes above lists the core values of the therapeutic community. It would be good to pause for a minute on the words “Value” for value has a very technical meaning. Values play an essential role in meaningful human living. A course in basic values for human living must be included in all high school curriculums. The dictionary definition of values is “principle or standards of behavior”. There are various stipulations for a thought or practice or behaviour to be accepted as a “value”. It is something I freely choose knowingly and hold to in my living and practice. It will be evident in my practical living, seen in my behaviour over a period of time, and is something I share with other persons.</p>
		<p>The core values of our life and of our living must be present in a therapeutic community. And we need to reflect them in our behaviour. The first of course is attachment, for without some form of openness and relationship to another nothing can be accepted or changed – the door remains closed. That doesn’t seem so bad, but rather realize and correctly realize that the heart of this living person is closed to the outside, closed to family, society, country, the world to be experienced. And the individual will not be aware of what he or she is missing in their life with others. That is the tragedy of mental illness. Let me end with a quote from William Glasser, in his book “Reality Therapy” – p.14.</p>
		<p>“We know, therefore, that at the time any person comes for psychiatric help he is lacking the most critical factor for fulfilling his needs, a person whom he genuinely cares about and who he feels genuinely cares about him. Some times it is obvious that the patient has no close relationships… Therefore to obtain help in therapy the patient must gain or regain involvement, first with the therapist and then with others. His problem and accompanying symptoms will disappear once he is able to become involved and fulfill his needs’’.</p>

		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>his morning – a quiet Saturday morning – as I began to question myself – something I need to be continuously active at if I am to keep my aging mind clicking over I have to ask myself if I have slowed down, sat on the side wondering as I watched the quickening traffic going by, or am I losing the steady impetus I have had for years? There may be some slowing down even though physically I am still as active as ever – and have always had excellent merit cards from the doctors in Wockhard hospital (now taken by Fortis) just down the road. But this is not the time to start slowing, for the saying goes – the best is yet to come.</p>
		<p>And really that is what I experience – the best is yet to come. By that “best” I mean that the kids will understand themselves more, be more acceptant of the new openings and developments that face them. In turn they will make the changes needed in their attitudes, their thinking and their enjoyment of feelings for achieving what they want to achieve for themselves. They will relish their moves out of the “bad patches”, into the serenity, composure, the tranquility, and happiness that they may have missed. They will be free and experience freedom.</p>
		<p>I believe that the following quote, although quite long, speaks well of the role of freedom in our lives –</p>
		<p>“Inner freedom is above all freedom from the dictatorship of “me” and “mine”, of the ego that clashes with whatever it dislikes and seeks desperately to appropriate what comes down to breaking the bonds of affliction that dominate and cloud the mind. It means taking life into one’s own hands, instead of abandoning it to tendencies created by habit and mental confusion. In daily life this freedom allows us to be open and patient with others while remaining committed to the direction we have chosen to take in life. Indeed it is essential to have a sense of direction… Understanding that we are neither perfect nor completely happy, is not a weakness. It is a very healthy acknowledgement that has nothing to do with self-pity, pessimism, or a lack of self confidence.”</p>
		<p>This quote is from the book Happiness, a guide to developing Life’s Most Important Skill, by Matthieu Ricard, Little, Brown and Company, 2006.</p>
		<p>In a paragraph following on this quote Ricard speaks about renunciation. “Renunciation is not about depriving ourselves of that which brings us joy and happiness – that would be absurd; it is about abandoning what causes us inexhaustible and relentless distress.”</p>
		<p>Those are powerful words. And the renunciation can for a person be very powerful, giving them a freedom and acceptance of self that allows them to live their life in a happiness they never thought possible. So life goes on. And life in ASV goes on … Sometimes easy and smooth, but still having the perennial problems we have been having and I guess will have serious financial problems. At present it is very difficult to have new members of staff remain with us and be properly trained. We have seen some four or five staff who had been happy with us for a number of years reluctantly leave because they could not live in anyway comfortably on the salaries we are offering at present. And of course this hits us right down the line for the new staff that we take on and attempt to train up are not effective as old staff have been and they are just waiting to jump off to a higher paying institution. The most serious problem we have at present is financial.</p>
		<p>The result of this problem is that we need to increase the fees by one thousand rupees a month – something we have not done for a couple of years. In all of this I believe that the only way this problem is to be solved is by the government giving a pension to young people who are mentally ill. We have had quite a few people from other countries paying their fees here with their government pensions, for their governments send their pensions to them here.</p>
		<p>So now, I have again written a letter to you. As usual I enjoyed writing a letter to you although it may not give you a great deal of news of ASV. I go on as usual promising you more in the future. In fact, in the next letter I will tell you about the project of organizing all the old records of ASV – the histories, the studies, the letters, the success stories, etc. – so composing a book on the history of Athma Shakti.</p>
		<p>I end here – but I will be sending you another letter in the near future on some changes on the theory and outlook on treating mental illness – I believe in very much. “For many people with serious mental illness, however, existing treatments and rehabilitation may not be that effective for an extended period of time, if ever. For these people, being in recovery is not a matter of growth and development but of suffering and survival.” A fit training in social skills is what is recommended. I will explain all this in another letter – later.</p>
		<p>All the best to you,</p>
		<p><strong>Fr. Hank Nunn S.J. </strong></p>
		<p class="text-right"><strong>August 1, 2011 </strong></p>
		<p><span class="big-letter">S</span>o, I am mobile and remain active, very much enjoying being me. I do not know or can’t seem to remember whether when I was six years old I enjoyed being myself so much, or believed I could choose being this person I want to be. Really it is a beautiful experience appreciating - just appreciating - the person that each and every one of us is, and how we are allowed to just enjoy being the person we have been given to be and slowly allowed ourselves to become. We have so much to be thankful for. And the more we appreciate our present life the more we will find to appreciate. Remember that appreciation of self will never end for even at the end we hope that we will be able to fully appreciate ourselves, the me we will take along into eternity. Let us, each one of us, appreciate that we are all wonderfully made – and given so much to enjoy and be thankful for.</p>
		<p>So I enjoy allowing myself the experience of accepting myself and my history with all the many experiences that life has brought to me. And there still is the faith of opening to so much more to come, so much more to appreciate.</p>
		<p>This letter started out as just a few lines in which I had the impulse to express my warm feelings concerning the appreciative relationships that we all wish to enjoy among the various members of the Athma Shakti community.</p>
		<p>Yes, I realize and appreciate the relationships that all of us are sharing and have been sharing at many various levels and strengths we have among all of us who have come to be related in our community.</p>
		<p>………………One of my nephews contacted me about two months ago. He lives in Australia and has visited me many years ago, just as I was in the beginning stages of setting up Athma Shakti. He was making a trip to Canada and invited me to go back to Canada with him and his wife and two children and spend some time with his mother who is my sister and my only remaining direct family member. But if I went with him I might not be able to return to India and that would break my heart. For truly my home is here where I am now – here with so many persons who share my life with me. And I can celebrate occasions with them – as in January this year I celebrated my 82nd year of life. On August 14th of 1951 I enjoyed joining the Jesuit group of Catholic priests in order to later become a priest. That meant leaving my home in Halifax, Canada in order to be ready to study, learn, and engage in whatever was asked of me. In fact as I was just beginning as a Jesuit I was sent for three months in the Torai area of West Bengal to care for people and families made refugees in the West Bengal refugee camps because of the unsettled situation in West Bengal.</p>
		<p>I have had a very active and interesting life and have many stories I could tell. As I find the time I am attempting from time to time to put many of my stories down on paper.</p>
		<p>All of us need to remain thankful for all that we have received, and are receiving.</p>

		<p><span class="big-letter">O</span>n this occasion – yet not a new occasion - but a meaningful time of year as we celebrate the original coming of Christ into our world. At the same time we remember that we have the possibility of new openings, new rewarding experiences, new adventures, new enjoyments, new wonders, to strengthen our happiness and joy of living.</p>
		<p>This time for me is usually my time for reflecting on myself – something we all need to be doing as we go along, enjoying going along, struggling going along, enjoying sliding along, sharing my going along, amazed as I am as I ‘go along’.</p>
		<p>There are so many people who wish me and others to have all go well - they wish us success – people who wish to have all go well and become well – to take responsibility for themselves and their growing and accepting, trusting, reassuring, strengthening- so all will work out – positive strengthening thoughts now come along – all is positive – all will work out – growing in inner awareness that inspires being open, being happy with the positive life within me.</p>
		<p>Life is growing, newly experiencing – there is a restoring gift of acceptance and love –open myself to this now – being accepted and wanted – forgiven, accepted, aided, supported, deeply and openly – allow the strength, the reassurance to grow and develop – to become firm and sure – giving the support, extending the support, causing the ease, the comfort so all is well, all manner of things are well – the other’s hand is there, here for me to grasp and feel the warmth, support, comfort – being free and relaxed – present with the other – trusting and experiencing the love – the care given to me all my life – as so many circumstances turning out well – so I keep believing – all works out as I trust and allow myself to experience the positive coming to me through the other’s love for me.</p>
		<p>Various ideas coming into my awareness – accept them all – keep it positive – for the future will be positive – make it positive – what does positive mean? – open, leading, could be enthralling, could contain everything always searched for, open self to all - to whatever is now present – pick up the lead – go with it – stay aware – stay positive – knowing the future is always open – future is always open for growth – wanting newness- to rely on newness – must be kept alive and active – aware of the inner questioning that leads the person to the experience of being one’s self – finding self – establishing the meaning for self now – so self believes – self is enticed to – imagine - to feel the goodness, the enticement, drawn ahead, going with it – it is there to be advanced – to be discovered – to be brought into the centre – there to be shared, discovered, emphasized, emphasized with others, as others open and appreciated are present – persons depend, need to be shown the way, handed along to their dreams, yet still with me, with us, enriching us, by spiritual support, spiritual strength continually growing from within, enabling, enticing to the new, to the unthought of, to the “new” pushing its way through the usual.</p>
		<p>Present now, breaking forth in the now – in gratitude accept these – grab the moment – cause them, to happen – happen now – for now just when they fit and lead ahead – let them take you ahead.</p>
		<p>The community – first and foremost – source of strength for all – leading each and every one to the intricacies – so to aid in growing together – establishing the creative- the beauty of positive excitement carrying each and all along – discovering, learning, believing, solving, widening, deepening – all possible – believe – go for it – its there – discover with joy – be enthused – be open – catch up to the movement – there’s more ahead – be thankful – thankful for self, thankful to self – thankful to others – they lead – they accompany – they give direction – they point – they question as they give new life, new strength, new questions – new consolations – stay open, ready and expectant – there is always more – more delight - more surprise - more time – more company – more discovery – more depth – more value – yes, it all has meaning – and more meaning – to surprise the loyal seeker seeking the infinite.</p>

		<p>The therapeutic community that is Athma Shakti Vidyalaya was initially set up to offer a new holistic methodology that would be used in the treatment of all different types of mental illness. Some interested people who have come to appreciate our positive and acceptant approach to rehabilitation have defined us as trend setters in this field. In this line, the Newsweek magazine has published an article on the growing realization of many professionals treating the mentally ill that the great and almost sole emphasis on treatment with medicines is no longer valid.</p>
		<p>“Patients really must have therapy in order to improve” says University of Newcastle psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Turkington. “Medication alone will not do it”</p>
		<p>Our goal has always been to enroll in the community young people who are showing the first beginnings of mental problems However, most often we have been the last resort for families, when nothing else has been effective. One young man told me, “I have been through ten psychiatrists.” But have those psychiatrists spoken with the boy, gone through his very early history with him, shown him acceptance and a positive interest?</p>
		<p>“Indeed, suffering a breakdown – often characterized by disorganized thinking, delusions and hallucinations – in your late teens or early 20s could be seen as an opportunity to intervene with therapy to mitigate the disease. If worked through properly, it could become a breakthrough,” says psychiatrist Dr. Shankarnarayan Srinath. “If people are helped at that stage, they will begin to make meaning of their suffering. If they don’t have help to work it through, it is likely they will become a chronic, lifelong psychiatric patient.”</p>
		<p>It is necessary to realize that young people who are beginning to have psychiatric problems can be brought to accept help that is offered by a knowing, open, accepting therapist. As the relationship with the therapist is beginning that disturbed person will gradually, or at times, suddenly experience acceptance. With the acceptance the interactive conversation develops. The person starts to realize that he is not being rejected, that this person is making a serious attempt to understand him. He may be amazed that his moods, his beliefs are being accepted, so also his tendencies to withdraw. Then the talk will come around to the feelings he is experiencing and how they affect his relationship with others, how they cause him to withdraw or to speak or act in a manner unacceptable to others. The experience of being accepted will lead the person to consider changing the attitudes and beliefs that are causing him to behave in the manner that he unconsciously shows in his many unsuccessful attempts to relate meaningfully with others. With the therapists support he will learn the new and rewarding skill of conducting himself properly with others, even with family members. Usually these positive interactions will allow him to develop a new and practical responsibility for living his life.</p>
		<p>This process is only possible when the therapist recognizes that the person who is disturbed mentally has always a part of the personality that is intact. The emotional memories might be taking over the thoughts and feelings, but the abilities and skills that they have not been able to access during the illness are there to be resurrected and used again. It is possible that they may learn new skills, finish studies, and become the personal agents of their own lives. One person who has witnessed this change in some suffering from serious psychological problems refers to the process as authorizing the individual to become an expert in his living, now responsible for his or her new goals and decisions.</p>
		<p>In line with the Newsweek article, we must admit that it is not the medication that is going to make the person decide to make the necessary changes in his thoughts and feelings. The pertinent question to be asked at this time is – what is the reason that almost every person with mental illness if allowed would not follow a regime of medication? Deep down they seem to be convinced that they must be led with care to their own decision for change.</p>
		<p>At Athma Shakti we have been able to lead many to that decision of welcome change. The therapeutic approach that we employ takes much meticulous and quiet follow through, an approach that is patient and stimulating, always supportive. This approach demands a trained and experienced staff, an ample staff who themselves are actively involved in their own continuous personal growth, constantly aware of their own selflearning.</p>
		<p>We have a successful program, that has been proved over the last 25 years. Yes, successful but the program has not been very successful in finding the needed financial resources to carry on its work. No doubt that may be because of the lack of interest in general public in mental illness.</p>
		<p>We believe that our work at Athma Shakti Vidyalaya is as important as the technological advances taking place around us but much more valuable. One offers people many new means to immediately communicate information and at the same time Athma Shakti Vidyalaya offers to people who are impaired an enriching life through developing new communication skills.</p>
