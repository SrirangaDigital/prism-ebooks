			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Directive therapy sessions I have had with kids </h2>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>ith many of the kids I kept up a directive correspondence even after they had left the community. Some developed nto interesting stories of how the kids were progressing. I kept many of the letters the kids wrote back to me. To give you an idea of my recorded work with them I have compiled these writings, a few of which I include here.</p>
			<p><strong>Maria </strong></p>
			<p><strong>I am writing these pages to speak about Maria</strong>, one of the most loved and appreciated members of the community. For me, she was special – as any member of the staff would have been able to tell you. She was warmhearted, hesitant, reluctant. I would say that she was just always reluctant to express herself and take on anything new or doubtful. She was beautifully reluctant, shy and a worrier. Her personality was a result of her early life at home on a farm where she grew up with her younger brother, parents and an uncle.</p>
			<img src="images/0037.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Maria joined the community in July 1998. She was 26 years old when she came here for treatment. She had been having treatment in Germany for many years for the problem which had caused her to leave her employment as a qualified nurse.</p>
			<p>She would suffer from attacks of phobic hysteria, which could strike her at any time – while walking along the street, or involved in taking care of a patient in the hospital, or even just being at home. She was very sensitive, very worried that at any time an attack could arise and she would have to stop and remain as if frozen to the spot or lay down on the ground or floor, wherever she happened to be at the time. The attacks were very upsetting and disruptive of her functioning.</p>
			<p>She had been born into a farm family, with a younger brother who also himself suffered from some form of paranoia and visited Maria while she was with us and then after her death, came to us with an intention to follow treatment for himself but after a few months found his wanderlust too strong for him, so he left to travel and did not make any contact after leaving.</p>
			<p>When a small girl at home Maria had suffered some molestation by an uncle which had affected her strongly and negatively, and so, she had never been open to any thoughts of marriage.</p>
			<p>She overcame this fear of men through her stay with us and sometime after her return to Germany she developed a happy relationship with a young man.</p>
			<p>While Maria was here I felt it a profitable exercise to express the work that I was doing with Maria, so that later I could share this with other interested therapists. So I am including now some of the records of my therapy done with Maria.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>his morning I went for my walk- Maria didn’t come. When I came back Maria was not as usual waiting for me in my room. I had prepared a bottle of milk ready because I usually would give her a bottle each morning. When I was beginning to read she came in to me. I was going to offer her the bottle but she asked to talk.</p>
			<p>She described how she had been up three times during the night – had been up at 5 o’ clock and walked up and down in the room afraid to come for the walk. She was afraid of her weakness and fearful that she might have a panic attack, as she has had sometimes before, on the walk. When there was something she wanted but she couldn’t do, she blamed herself for her weakness. She usually very much wanted to come for the walk. She then runs a long dialogue in her head and blames herself for being weak and says she should be able to go for the walk. She blames herself and causes herself to feel ashamed for being weak. She makes herself more afraid of her body being weak and her being unable to control her limbs. As usual I quietly accepted what she was saying, trying to reassure her that she would be safe with me, as I promised to accept her.</p>
			<p>Each day she continued to say how much she enjoyed the walk and morning air. Then slowly she went into expressing the fear, shaking and crying. After about ten or fifteen minutes all became quiet. She found it very relaxing, she carried on and continued being to be somewhat withdrawn. I quietly gave her messages about being acceptant of herself and how good she is, how she is wanted and accepted. This continued for another thirty minutes at least, and she was very withdrawn. It took some time as she gradually enabled herself to become settled. As she became settled I mentioned we had to have breakfast, which seemed to have some impact. I was able to bring her around to having some fruit which I prepared for her and gave her. She remained quite withdrawn. I told her I was going for my bath and she lay down in my room. I let her be there for sometime after my bath. Then I rolled her over slowly and looked at her closely. She responded by becoming very open and smiling, having come through fully.</p>
			<p>We didn’t spend any more time together in the morning – already I had been working with her almost four hours. I had another person to see and had to go out after lunch. I met her before I went, she was fine. When I came back in the evening she said that she had had bad migraines during the afternoon and still had an ‘ordinary’ headache now.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 12, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">A</span> Sunday morning – I stayed in ASV overnight in order to go at five thirty to the airport to meet someone. When I returned a little after nine ‘o’ clock, Maria was in my room beginning her breakfast. As I greeted her she became upset so I held her as she talked about how she had been in the morning<strong>. </strong>She had woken up early and had gone for a short walk with Rema which was alright, except that she felt very much lost within herself. She went for her breakfast and then was quite afraid and reluctant to ask the kitchen staff, who were preparing breakfast for what she wanted, in this case to be able to use the toaster to toast her bread. She had Rema bring the toaster to the room for her to use. In doing this she is very critical of herself, she thinks she should not be asking for what is special. She has a sense of being lost and in confusion, that she has no where to go to be settled within herself. She knows she has my room and then finally goes there. Yet she is blaming herself for not feeling at ease, for not believing that she can belong and does belong.</p>
			<p>I spent some time holding her and reassuring her of her place with me and told her that I would be back with her later in the day. I told her to remain in the room as much as she wanted. When I returned in the afternoon she was settled, in fairly good spirits. She had cleaned and dusted my room and bathroom completely.</p>
			<p>I have been thinking on this after reading a book yesterday on healing with Buddhist practice and also a book Delna gave me this morning on the link between Buddhist practice and psychotherapy. Both books take for granted the meditation and practice, the first on being aware of thoughts as passing and seeing the process of not being attached to the thoughts, the second on the meditation enabling the practitioner to move into the emptiness, which the author believes Western psychotherapy is always trying to avoid accepting. The other day when I was trying to explain to a retreatant the process of not being attached to the negative “destructive” thoughts. I realized that this was the process I was attempting to have him accept, that is, to go deeper within himself to the simple acceptance of his existence, of being loved into existence by the Father at this moment. I suppose I might say of allowing oneself to fall into the experience of the Father’s love and acceptance, not trying to build up a self that is able to withstand the temptations, thoughts and inclinations that keep arising in the mind.</p>
			<p>Also in our discussion with a patient the other day, it became clear that his identity was in being a Karate expert. He stated that he was not his father’s son, not a patient at ASV, but a Karate expert. Over the years this had been his obsession, although he has never passed an examination or qualified in any way to be a recognized practitioner of Karate. We have always considered this a crazy obsession, yet it is something very essential in his view of himself. I believe we need to recognize that he does not have the security or ability to accept his basic insecurity. His parents have not given him the security to question his security, to admit that it is all right to go into the emptiness.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 13, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>his morning when I came out of my room at 5.30 am Maria was there ready to go for the morning walk with me. Lately she has not been coming for the walk, something that she had been doing daily with me for many months. She enjoys these walks very much especially as the dogs are with us – she takes the little dog that is attached to her. After the walks the usual thing was for me to hold her and give her a child’s milk bottle. She would be very little at that time and it gave me an opportunity to give her messages about her being accepted and safe and protected.</p>
			<p>She has not been coming for the walks in the past week or so because of her fear of the panic attacks. She has had a couple of these attacks during the walk, interestingly always when we are midway through the walk at a spot where we usually sit and rest. During the walks, there is never any talking, as I want to use the time for my own reflection and mediation. I have done this for years. She is afraid of feeling physically weak. The panic attack usually begins with her feeling a bit dizzy and then her legs become weak, she is afraid of falling down. At times she senses that her limbs are moving away from her and that her body is falling apart. The attacks, which she has had on the walks, usually last about fifteen minutes and we are able to sit on the small wall over a drain. The fear during the attack seems to come in waves, she often feels suffocated. Her arms and legs need to be often controlled Yet she can come through the attack and walk back easily enough, and after ten minutes or so she is normal and fine.</p>
			<p>So, this morning she was eager to come for the walk, with a desire to show she could do it. All went well although she said when we sat and rested that she was nervous. We came back, I fed the dogs and came up to hold her and give her a milk bottle She began the bottle but then after a minute or so refused it. I continued to hold her and she was showing some agitation but not much. she got up and went to rinse her mouth at the sink and came back to be held. When she is agitated in this way she wants to pull her hair and hit her chest. She does not struggle very much and I continue to hold her for about 30 minutes usually. I make sure that all the agitation is passed.</p>
			<p>At the end this morning I asked as usual what was upsetting her. She felt that the milk from the bottle had a special taste because it was from a new bottle purchased a few days ago and not used before. She said that the milk with a certain taste gets stuck in her throat and she is afraid of suffocating. She has often mentioned that one of her greatest fears is of suffocating. She asked me if I believed her, and accepted what she was going through. She has a great fear that people do not take her seriously and believe that she does not have to go through all that she is going through.</p>
			<p>Then we went for yoga and all was well after that. During breakfast she was as bright and fresh, humorous as usual. I share my breakfast with her – all fruit. I wanted to be sure that she is having enough to eat.</p>
			<p>Then there is the treatment group. She sits beside me in the group; she also does not want to attend any group if Dale or myself are not leading it. During the group I held her and she began to be upset, crying and breathing with difficulty. I concentrated on the others in the group and slowly she settled down and was quiet and relaxed at the end of the group. Since it was lunchtime I did not question her about what her feelings were during the group.</p>
			<p>I was going up to spend the night at Mt. St. Joseph’s, after I spent sometime with Manju in my room. When we came into the room Maria was sitting in the chair looking quite withdrawn. I held Manju for some time and then Maria came over to be held. She was upset, said that she felt tense, insecure and sad. In the past few days, I experienced that she seemed to be often in these feelings. She complained of feeling lost or isolated. She had said in the past that it was difficult for her to carry over the reassurances and security which she has experienced when with me. When she is alone she falls back on feeling isolated and lost, although she says she does make some effort to keep me in mind. She would say my presence is not in some way imprinted in her body, or felt in her body. The reason I gave her so much physical contact was to impress on her my acceptance of her and my wish that she can feel in some manner at ease when she is not with me.</p>
			<p>I believed that in order for this to happen she had to develop some trust, which she believes is quite impossible for her. I have never confronted her on the fact that she is not open at a very deep level so that she would have to open and trust. From what she has said when we discuss trust I understand that she believes that her very early experiences earlier than she could ever remember, have caused her to be so fearful of the world.</p>
			<p>I stayed with her until she settled although it made me late for an appointment at Mt. St. Joseph’s. I gave her reassurance that I would be down first thing in the morning, this was not special; I usually walk down early in the morning.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 14, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> spent the night at Mt. St. Joseph’s. I came down early in the morning at about 6.30 am to sit in my room. After a few minutes Maria came in and I held her for sometime. She was quiet and undisturbed. There was no yoga this morning. We had the usual breakfast. I was not feeling at all well today and rested for some time before the marathon group began. During the marathon she put her head down for some time.</p>
			<p>At lunch she was expressing a very close dependency and acceptance of me, an openness and affection. She did this by hugging me and expressing herself in a low but intense voice. The afternoon was much the same as the morning except that she had some trouble with the noise when Nitesh was being confronted in the group. This was a heavy time with voices getting loud at times. Nitesh was attempting to defend a huge paranoid delusion that he has been building up for two years. I took Maria with me to Mt. St. Joseph’s to give her a break; she likes the garden there. She said that today she has been insecure, helpless and somewhat afraid. She was very caring when she knew that I was not feeling well.</p>
			<p>She told me later that while at Mt. St. Josephs she felt weak and falling, she described it as a kind of slipping down. Her body feels light as if it were going to fly away. I asked if it was like some sort of trance but she said no, it was the weakness, the insecurity that was within her, especially the fear, an unconscious fear that plays in her body. She cannot describe what the fear is but just knows it is there influencing her. It is something she cannot become free of. Her views about all this are quite strong, and she does not appear open to question her stand.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 15, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>his has been a quiet day, may be the reason being that I was not so well. I didn’t go walking first thing in the morning nor did I take the yoga. Maria came to me for a short time before the yoga started just to say good morning and to see how I was. She went for the yoga and then prepared the breakfast. Later I brought her fruit for breakfast and had to make some toast and black tea for my own breakfast. After breakfast we spent time talking; it is a bit difficult for me to remember all that we discussed, but I believe it was again the memories which are deep in the body tissues. How far back can this memory go? While she was talking I thought of Katherine, the Australian girl who had been used in a satanic cult when she was an infant. Again her memories were hardly there, being just some sort of hunch that she had some memory of something happening to her in a negative and strange manner. Katherine came out of this more through the evocation of different personalities.</p>
			<p>So, I supported Maria in saying that perhaps there could be real memories that supported her sense of being suffocated at times. She had started the discussion in saying that she felt there was a pest of some kind pricking her inside her throat and hindering her swallowing. She admitted readily enough that there was nothing there but asked if it might be connected to a memory of some sort of piercing or invasion of her throat.</p>
			<p>As we walked she could accept that memories in the physical body could be absorbed or integrated and the person could be freed of them. Yet she still holds that there is a deeper level that cannot be reached and hence will remain with the person causing fears, such as the panic fears that come up in her.</p>
			<p>Also we talked a bit about her weight. She wanted reassurance that if she put on weight it would not cause her to be more prone to receiving attacks from men. I had said the day before that she was “very feminine” something she wanted me to explain. I told her that she carried herself in a womanly manner, not trying to be enticing as some women make themselves out to be. She has the delicacy of a woman. But has difficulty being around a group of men. She mentioned that in the past – eight years before – she did have times when she had enjoyed being with a man.</p>
			<p>She was in a steady and balanced mood throughout the day, very supportive of me, pleasant to be with, relaxed. Often quite thoughtful.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 18, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am writing this after two days and so I cannot be as specific as I would have been had I been able to write on the evening of the 16th. The 16th was a much different day. There was no early morning walk: Maria was held by me for some time before the yoga. At breakfast I noticed that she seemed to space out and be too quiet. I asked her what was happening with her. She didn’t give me any reply, but reacted by moving and continuing her breakfast. After finishing her breakfast she came to me to sit on my knees and then began quietly to cry. She was becoming quite depressed and sad. And slowly was talking about her thoughts. She was basically saying that she didn’t see herself coming out of the problems that she has. She used various phrases about this, such as, “There is no way out”, “It will always be the same”, “You can’t understand”. She remained with me quiet, then moved off, she had to do her cleaning work. I went to the office and groups. After tea in the afternoon I took her with me to Mt. St. Joseph’s so we would have time to talk. There she was still in the same mood, down, seeing her condition as helpless. I had not experienced her as so withdrawn before. At one time – perhaps in the evening when I held her again – she seemed to be giving herself permission to be down, saying that she had a right to feel down.</p>
			<p>She realized she was down and it was as if she needed to spend some time just being quiet and withdrawn. Of course the fear was always there, for the fear causes her to be withdrawn and reluctant to have contact with any person other than myself. During the day she was lying in bed most of the time.</p>
			<p>In the evening when I spent time with her she was feeling better. We did not go into a discussion on how she had been feeling in the morning. I had to go in the night to meet Jenny at the airport at 2.30 a.m. Maria was looking forward very much to Jenny’s coming.</p>
			<p>In the morning she came to me early. I had been up early to take the dogs out and feed them. She was feeling quite positive and I held her some time during the yoga time. She asked me many questions about Jenny. She is quite attached to Jenny because she had spent some time with Jenny in her community before coming here and when she went back to renew her visa.</p>
			<p>In the morning she was in the girls group and found it all right. I was a bit surprised, as she had wanted to only be in the groups with Usha or Dale. She does find the other therapists helpful, although she does appreciate Tara. She came with me to Mt. St.</p>
			<p>Joseph’s in the afternoon. She appreciates the garden very much. We spent some time together in the evenings as usual. Always the last thing I do with kids in the day is to hold them. This is often a difficult time for her because the other kids come down from the living-room and prepare for bed. It is quite a noisy time; especially distressing is the banging of doors both by the girls and the boys. I have mentioned to the peer group many times but our population just don’t pay attention when they open and close doors. Maria will jerk when a door is slammed. I am very accustomed now when holding her that when there is a loud noise she will jerk her body. It is a fear response that keeps repeating itself. I reassure her that she is safe, that nothing bad is going to happen.</p>
			<p>There is a much stronger fear reaction. If any person comes into my room while I am holding her, that is enough to start a small panic attack which will go on for ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
			<p>Saturday morning, March 18th, was quiet and relaxing. I didn’t go for my walk, so spent the time with Maria. She was doing well, happy to have the time together, but one of the girls who was going out came in to say good-bye and take my hand. This caused the reaction I have just described above. So it took some time to bring her around to be quietly resting. After that she made coffee for both of us and we sat out on the balcony. She became very interested in the newsweek article on the little boy who shot the little girl in the United States. She was interested, not in any special way. Really her reaction was very mature and reasonable.</p>
			<p>I had to go to town to arrange the trip I was to make, so I invited Maria to come with me. She appreciates very much coming with me to town. And she is a good companion. Over tea in town we had a long discussion, really she did most of the talking. Basically it was the fear that she experiences in her body. She said that even when she goes for a short walk of twenty minutes with the dogs she is usually very afraid. She is afraid that her limbs are too weak and cannot support her weight, or that they will fly off. She has some sort of fantasy, she used the word “fantasy” that her body will fall apart or pieces will fly off, almost as if she will disappear. She has to tell herself to be tense and strong in order to carry on as if nothing was happening. In times past she says that after she returned home from being in the city she had to collapse in bed and often cut herself to punish herself for what was happening to her, to make herself feel real again. Throughout the discussion and at the end she did not hold out much hope for a resolution of this problem but that she would have to find some means of living with the problem.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>March 25, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> have not written about an incident, which happened on Wednesday evening, March 22nd, while I was away in the jungle. The bread which Leena and Maria keep for themselves in the fridge became wet because of the fridge defrosting. But in the morning, Maria had set aside some bread for herself. When she went to get that in the evening it was gone. She became very upset and went though a long session of panic and stress. When in such a situation she says that she is being punished and that it happens because she is bad. She was hitting herself and rolling about on her bed. Since I was not there no one could touch her. One of the staff went and brought some bread from the store but then Maria would not have it. It seems the emotions she is having these times are a mixture of great fear, and also an anger that she takes out on herself, believing that she is bad and deserves the unjust punishment. She had told me on Thursday morning that she was very upset on Wednesday evening but I did not ask her for the details.</p>
			<p>This morning we were to go for an early walk with the dogs, something she likes very much. When I came out of my room she was at the top of the stairs to tell that she was not feeling good and so could not come. I went alone saying I would be with her when I came back. I was back and reading my prayers when she came into the room. She put her head down in my lap and I continued reading. After the reading we remained in the same position. She began to say a few words. At one time she said she felt like an embryo and felt like being surrounded by water and darkness I said that was all right, I would help her. I gave her sentences, like her body will grow strong, the bones will develop and the skin cover them. Meanwhile I was stroking her arms and moving them. She kept her head on my stomach during the time as I stroked her head and arms. I felt I could enable her to grow stronger in her body by quietly being with her and giving her short messages about her body growing and her skin being protective. I let her feel my breathing and heart beat, let her have her head on my chest. She seemed to be taking in the comfort and assurance. She felt at ease and lay quietly. After the session she was lively and well.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>April 1, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> have been remiss in that I have not written anything in the past week. I have to begin with an important day, last Sunday, March 26th. I was at Mt. St. Joseph’s when I received a phone call at 8.00</p>
			<p>a.m. to come down to ASV as Maria was having a serious panic attack. I found out later that she had asked that I be called down. She had had a good morning before that. She was up and took the dogs out and fed them and spent some quiet time with herself. Then she was walking towards my room and felt very weak and disturbed as if her body was going into pieces. She was led to her bed by Leena, but would not allow her to touch her. She went through the usual beating herself, trembling and rolling about.</p>
			<p>She had diarrhea during the night; she believes that makes her very weak. As she does not eat very much, so no doubt this is true. They gave her some juice and electrolytes. When I came in she came easily to my arms and I took a little time to settle as I held her. I remained holding her for over 30 minutes, slowly giving her messages about being safe and accepted. She drank large quantities of water. When she felt better I brought her over to my room and we quietly spent time together. I had some breakfast and she also had some fruit and toast.</p>
			<p>She spoke about being afraid of the condition of her stomach and the physical problem, which she was having. She feels helpless and worried about how long she is going to be in this condition. She distrusts the Indian medicine and wants to be able to come through the physical problem without medicine. In some way I agree with this as she wants to build up her strength. In our talking she mentioned various aspects of the panic attack as it comes on her. At times it seems to come suddenly and without warning.</p>
			<p>Later, in the afternoon, Jenny came and so we had some time together, the three of us. She has great trust in Jenny. Then I went off with Jenny for dinner.</p>
			<p>On Monday morning, Maria felt weak so there was no going for a walk, I had decided not to go myself anyway since I was quite tired. So we spent time together. She talked about her weakness and different messages which she had received when young around food although she may not have been given these messages clearly, she had formed them for herself. She still had a stomach problem but refused to take medicine. She hoped that slowly it would go away.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>April 2, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p>came back to the house at about nine in the morning and found Maria sitting quietly in my chair writing letters. She had been up early, took the dogs for a good walk, and was in good spirits for she knew I was coming early. We spent time quietly together. It was a strengthening session.</p>
			<p>In the evening we had an important discussion. It was at eight ‘o’ clock, tea time for the community. I had not had dinner and so wanted a couple of cheese sandwiches. I was organizing the bread and cheese when I was called to the phone, spending half an hour on the phone. When I came back she had all the sandwiches ready. As we were sitting after eating them she wanted to communicate something very important. She spoke of her disturbance when she was preparing the food, knowing that I had gone for a long telephone call. She had prepared my food but then was not willing to accept that she could have more food for herself. She puts herself down saying to herself that she has no right to take more food, in some way she must earn the food, which she takes into herself. While she is doing this questioning and moving from different positions within herself she is stirring up much anger that takes her away from her thinking. The anger develops and she shifts into a mood in which she rejects herself strongly.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>April 03, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>hen Maria came to me this morning after my walk, she said that she woke up feeling strong and liked the weather and wanted to walk but it was too late and so she came down on herself for being lazy and not doing what she could have done. We talked then and about it later how she is so very critical of herself, rejecting of herself. She is continually being in judgment on herself. She expects me to be able to sense or realize this action of hers in blaming herself. It is an experience, which she has of herself which is very deep, very much a living part of her personality that has been with her since the beginning. It is not an experience which she believes can be adjusted or changed since it is very much herself. I reassured her that I accept this experience she has of herself. She has difficulty trying to speak about this, most people she has talked with have tried to take it more or less lightly and so she feels it is better not to talk about it. It cannot be simply explained. The experience has caused her much pain over the years, kept her in fear and drained her energy. I say I will be with her in this. She accepts that I can tell her to stop putting herself down. I believe she needs a constant and sure support in whatever situation she is in.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>April 9, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hese past few days in my holding sessions with Maria in the mornings we have been working on the close contact which she believes she needs. She lies on my chest and I speak to her messages concerning the growth of her body. The way she sometimes reacts when very little, it is as if she is a prebirth. She wants to feel that her body is closed and is one. I speak to her with messages reassuring her of the formation of her body, how her skin can be growing stronger all the time, the protection that her skin gives to her.</p>
			<p>On the 7th, I spent over a half an hour on the assimilation of food, from taking in through the mouth to the digestion and then moving throughout the body strengthening her, especially concentrating on the build up of the skin. She wishes me to keep giving her messages, talking with her as she is very little. I find it easy to talk to her about herself and what is happening within her body as she grows.</p>

She sat down in my room with her oranges and plate. I went downstairs to get the fruit for my breakfast which I share with Maria to make sure that she is eating enough breakfast. At first I could not find my fruit in the fridge and became very angry. I did not express my anger but Maria realized that I was quite angry and sat there while I began to read the paper. After a little time I decided to look again for the fruit and found it. I then began my breakfast and began to share the fruit with Maria. She was by then deeply withdrawn, just sitting in her place looking off in the near distance. After finishing my breakfast I went over and tried to get her come out of the withdrawal, but I couldn’t draw her out. As I began to hold her she became quite restless and was gripping her hair and arms.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span> here is much I should have written about the past week but I have not been able to find the time. In the past few days Maria has been becoming more troubled, yet from time to time quite settled.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>May 2, 2000 </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span> he last ten days have been difficult days for Maria. In the last days she has been expressing her fears and wondering whether it would be better to return to Germany earlier. She has made the decision not to come back to Bangalore to engage in a program that would be recognized for her university course. She has been talking about being “not connected” as “being isolated”. She has not been eating as well as she should be eating. Her BP is very low – at times 90s over 50s. Because of this low BP she is often weak and dizzy and fainting. She has missed walking in the mornings because of this weakness.</p>
			<p>Last Wednesday, we had a profitable day,. She was at the Sunny Farm swimming when I came there on an outing with the Fathers from Mt. St. Joseph’s. So I joined her in the swimming. This became an excellent exercise, in that she was quite regressed and I could give her messages on the growth of her body from the beginning. She has always had a sense that her body was not finished , hence the insecurity and the numerous panic attacks she has had in her life. Since that day she has wanted more closeness.</p>
			<p>The last ten days had been very difficult days for Maria and she had to follow through on her decision to return to Germany. I was reluctant to see her go , but I felt it was necessary. And when in Germany, because of her health she could not think of returning to India .She still dreamed of returning to India but it was quite impossible for her. She kept up her correspondence with me which I include below and some of my responses then. She always gave Sano as her name when with me and she will always be Sano for me.</p>

			<p class="text-right"><strong>February 25, 2005 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am very sorry I have to postpone my traveling to you. I am in a very, very deep crisis and do not know how my condition will develop in the next days or weeks. I am on high medication and did not feel like this since probably many years. Sano is suffering so much. My job, my foot on the ground and I think I have to leave Thomas. I love him so much and he loved me and we could have a wonderful life. But he is very sick, needs lot of time for himself. I have no difficulties in giving him time. But I need a home, I want to make plans for the future, need this telling of being wanted, fully wanted and having a place. I do not have all this with him. He says he probably will never find a woman like me again, did not feel so much love for somebody before …. It is so sad. I tried to be patient but for me this relationship becomes more and more destructive. He is cold, is refusing me, sends me away and then he wants me being with him and enjoys having me around him. He makes his therapy and that will take a very long time. For me it would be okay, I can understand, I still would want him. I do not need a man who is functioning so well and earns lots of money and so on. I do not need all that. But, I need a home with somebody, a future and I would like to try to become pregnant. I could wait….. but now without having a place, means one apartment sharing with him and not moving from one place to the other not knowing for how long he wants me there. I am very, very sad and paralyzed, feel still, depressed and very much left alone. It is horrible.</p>
			<p>But I do not want to complain , I mean I am only sorry. I do not know what I can do. I went to the doctor this morning and he wanted to send me to the hospital. I did deny. I am looking for a therapist here and I think I did find somebody who is good. But everything will take time I do not have, really. I would need you so urgently, so much!! But I am not able to travel and I can not deal with an adventure, being in Bombay at the airport, feeling not safe when you are not with me each minute in India. I am too needy. I am very sorry.</p>
			<p>Take care of yourself and I hope you are fine!</p>
			<p><strong>Love Maria</strong> (Sano)</p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>June 14, 2005 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>any thanks for your letter, for sharing with me how you are and how you are doing… and please be sure, you do not complain. I mean if you would complain you really have enough reasons for it, but you do not. I thank you for expressing yourself as you did and for giving me the chance to know a little bit more about things which are not always so easy for you, which take away your energy. You must be very tired and you would need a break. And I know how difficult it is for you to set boundaries and to take time for yourself, and there are always people who have demands and always the wish in yourself to be for people. All the demands you have on yourself to be for people and to help them to live a more fulfilled life and can be more aware and happy. And I always did and do appreciate that but too much is too much. And you know that you have to care more for yourself…. and when you cannot do it for yourself then you have to think that you have to be more by yourself and be more at Mt. St. Joseph’s, take time for resting, meditating to refresh your energy and to do everything for having a long, long life… Please! I do not want you to feel criticized but I know I have to worry about you, if you let me know how you are doing or not. I want you to feel good without all the burdens and to feel at ease, at least sometimes. You forget about yourself and that is not good. I am sorry I cannot do anything for you, not really. I only can be with you in spirit.</p>
			<p>I am thinking of you so often during the day, have your pictures beside my bed and pictures of us in the kitchen. I miss you so much but yes, right now I cannot come and I am very thankful for being assured you accept my decision. Thank you for being you.</p>
			<p>I am here and try to work as a freelancer. I can work now more and more. And I like teaching and preparing the lessons. For a couple of weeks ago a former priest, catholic did ask me if I would like to train social workers, students and nurses in palliative care, how to care for dying people. He is very active and has lots of influence. You know that has been my main topic in my studies in nursing science. I am very happy and hope I will manage. I only have a big problem since last summer when I trained people who wanted to become a nurse in this school where they sent me off. The job has been very tiring and one day I collapsed in front of the class. I am not scared of the people and it is not because of my BP and it is not a panic attack. I get one when I get this dizziness. I really lose my consciousness. That threatened me very much. Right now I cannot teach one or two hours without feeling so weak, dizzy and loosing my feet on the ground. It is very scary, cannot see properly and feel fully weak. I go to the toilet and take medication. But something has to change otherwise I cannot continue doing this job. Then I collapsed by panting, fell almost off my chair, terrible, and so much exhausted. Something is overwhelming me, must be and I do not feel like this because I expect it. There is something very deep within myself I cannot figure out.</p>
			<p>It is so frustrating because actually I got more strong, I feel better, more stable compared to three years ago you know. I like working and it gives me a good feeling, but actually I am not ready for it and I try to find out what causes this feeling, in my therapy.</p>
			<p>So, it is me who is complaining, I am sorry. I wish I could be with you now! I love you so much and keep you in my heart!</p>
			<p><strong>Love Maria </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>any thanks for your warm letter, your compassion, concern and sharing with me your thoughts – thanks for being you and for being with me in spirit. I felt very touched by reading your letter, printed it and take it with me, given me a feeling of having you more close with me. That is a good feeling. And today Melissa sent me some pictures and I did see you on one of them and had tears in my eyes. I miss you so much and I only can repeat saying how much I would give for spending some time with you. Next year I hope we can make it happen.</p>
			<p>This time lots of things are happening. May be my job situation will change. This school I work for since a couple of months as freelancer did offer me a real job. I do not know the English word for it. It would not be full time but actually I could more rely on my working situation and it would be a more saving for me. On the one hand it would be great, on the other hand I would be much more under pressure. I will see..</p>
			<p>It is raining here, summer is gone now and it is getting cold. You would not feel comfortable here. Do you remember that you did phone me a couple of weeks ago? You did speak to me on my answering machine. I did save it and almost once a day I can listen to your voice. Pa, I am loving you and send my love out to you. Hope everything is well with you!</p>

			<p>Dear Dad,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am sitting here at my desk, thinking of you, wondering what and how you are doing. So, often I think I have to or I feel like writing to you and then something holds me back from doing it. May be because of my English it is becoming really more and more bad or only because my wish of sharing with you face to face is so strong and writing about my life here is so difficult because I can not put in words what I would like you to know.</p>
			<p>But, I feel fine so far. Concerning my job situation I have to be patient. But actually things are working out very well. I only can hope and trust I will manage my work in future and that people who may be could offer jobs will be able to do it, means can pay salary and would keep me. I am very much under pressure but I will see.</p>
			<p>Yes, and a couple of weeks ago I met a man. I like him very much, quite sick after Thomas…. but what to do, I mean I am really very interested in him, is intelligent, has lots of humour, makes me laugh, is sensitive and somebody I think I could rely on. He likes me very much and even we do not know ourselves really, not yet, there is a kind of bond. I am very glad meeting him and I will see and wait how a relationship can develop. It is very exciting and I am very happy and can enjoy with him. And then I put myself so much down, think I am not good enough, no good job and all my problems I have with myself, I will see.</p>
			<p>Pa, I wish you could be here and I hope everything is well with you. I love you very much !</p>
			<p><strong>Love Maria (Sano) </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>September 23, 2005 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> t is Friday evening and I am sitting here at my desk and I am thinking of you. So often during the day you are with me in spirits and I am thinking of you here with me and Sano…… now I am waiting for Klaus. The man I told you about. Yes, we are a couple now and so many things are new for me. He is so much different from Thomas. I like him very much and enjoy being with him. Sometimes it is as if I know him since a very long time and then I realize that I do not know him at all. I mean it takes lots of time to know each other. I am very happy and then I feel so insecure, question myself and feel so much inferior and he cannot understand. He is very sensitive and aware of people, of me but he is not used to talking about feelings, about himself. And for me it is new only being there without talking so much but to feel he really wants me and wants knowing me. He is quite successful in his job and works a lot and I cannot really understand that for him it is not so important how much money I earn or things like this. Then he says but I do not like you because of your job. I like you because of being you. And he is somebody who wants to merry one day, wants children, very much so, not now of course but in future. It is great, that is what I would like to have and to live. It is only that I do not trust my body or I feel too scared for being pregnant. And then I think I should not have a relationship with him so he can look for a woman who is not struggling so much. And then I only feel good and hope everything will work out well. We are in the beginning … It is difficult to trust that things will work out as they are supposed to do.</p>
			<p>I hope you feel fine so far and take care of yourself. What is with the second floor of your building? How is your health? I am looking forward to being with you whenever it will be, hopefully soon. Pa, I send my love out to you! Love Maria (Sano)</p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>May, 1 2006 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologize for not writing earlier, very much. I am sorry I did not send you a mail or tried phoning you. I do not know why did I hesitate writing to you… I sent you a postcard and hope somebody will take it to the place where you are resting and try to recover. Melissa told me about your operation and your angina. Pa, how much would I give for being with you now, but I cannot, not now but I still hope I or we can work something out. We will ! I am fairly sure!</p>
			<p>Please take care of yourself. I am proud of you that you are resting now. I wish you lots of strength and health! I am doing well so far. Klaus and me are moving together. Now I am sitting here at his desk. I am very happy with him. I try to become pregnant and we are thinking of being married. I hope I will manage, I am very scared of losing the gifts or presents I have in my life. I do not know how to put in words what I mean but I think you understand. I still have to struggle but that is probably my life. Pa, I love you so much! Thank you for being you! That I have more and more a fulfilled life is only because of you. My heart is full of gratitude by thinking of you and our memories! I am being with you in spirit!</p>
			<p><strong>Love Maria </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>August 16, 2006 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologise my delay in writing to you. I do not know what holds me back. I am thinking of you so often during the day, each day and you are in my mind, but sometimes there is a hesitation of writing. And thank you for being with me in spirit.</p>
			<p>The operation went well. I have been so scared, had night mares each night a couple of weeks before. And Klaus has been with me, took two days off and did care for me. And the best thing is, the doctor who has made an examination before has not been right and that was the reason for my trouble. My tubes have not been closed. Everything is fine with my ovaries and I only had a harmless cyst, nothing to worry about. I am fully healthy. So, I am very happy and I or we hope I will become pregnant one day. Now I have trouble with my hormones but that could be because of the stress I had.</p>
			<p>And actually I am fine. I am working as a freelancer and my business is going well. I will never become rich but it is okay. I mainly train nurses who specialize for being in charge of dying people.</p>
			<p>What I really worry about is my physical condition. I feel strong and healthy. It is only my very weak nervous system. I still have these sensations and feelings of losing my conscious and feeling dizzy. I am very frustrated because it is so exhausting. I am doing therapy but may be there is something deep within myself I can not find a solution or may be something got broken one day and I can not repair it. Even when I feel good and I would not expect something but I can have lots of sensations which make me feeling weak.</p>
			<p>But yes, my life is good and I am doing well. My relationship with Klaus is good. What about you? Did you find out something about your visa application? How is your health and your skin on your nose? I hope we can be together soon! Pa, take care of yourself! I send my love out to you!!</p>
			<p><strong>Maria (Sano) </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>September 25, 2006 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Pa,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">N</span>ow I am sitting here at my desk, thinking of you and hope you are fine and wondering what you are doing. Oh Yes, what would I give for being with you now, spending time with you, sharing with you and seeing you… but we work on it and I trust we will meet in person next year. It seems a good chance with this Governor who is interested in the methods of ASV and how they can be used in the government hospital in Chandigarh. I have to look it up where it is. I hope you will be able to use his backing to get your visa extended. I am sorry you have all this trouble with your visa.</p>
			<p>I have some problems with my health, my back, have a slipped disc. I hope I used the right word. I looked it up in the dictionary . It is paining but I feel all right with it. It is only tiring, riding on my bicycle two hours a day, that is good, get special gymnastic and take my hot water bottle with me. Being active is better than resting.</p>
			<p>And I have great news. Klaus and me will marry this year. I am very, very happy and thank God for giving me this man. The registry office wedding will be on the 23 December, before Christmas, that has been my wish. We both are catholics but the church as an institution does not mean much to us. We believe in God but having a church wedding would not be right or atleast I am not sure because without it I also feel not good. Klaus knows a deacon since he is a child and he wants to be blessed by him. And yes, my deep, deep and very strong wish would be that you would marry me and Klaus and that you would bless us in person. That would mean so much to me and would make me so happy!! But how can we arrange? People in Germany have to be married by the office before the church would accept a church wedding. We would like inviting you, but may be on Christmas and with all the family we both would not have enough time for each other and I really want you and me and you and Klaus and me. So, may be Klaus and me will come to India, I do not know when or if you have a visa you could come next year to Germany. I hope we will work something out… What do you think ? Would that be okay for you?</p>
			<p>Pa, I miss you, I miss you very much. take care of yourself! I love you and send my love out to you !</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Email sent from Fr. Hank to Maria </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>August 28, 2005 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Maria,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, hoping and determined to make it all happen, a visit with you some time next year. Something to look forward to. I pray that your work situation works out in some sort of satisfactory manner for you. So, that you may feel settled and more at ease with yourself. Speaking of pictures I will have to send you some pictures of Kandu who is growing very well, very friendly and a good companion. I think you would love him.</p>
			<p>Remember I keep you in mind, and within my heart, that is, where I have my deep feelings and warmth and openness. Happy to know that you are present there, with Sano quietly present and wishing and wanting.</p>
			<p><strong> Love Pa </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>December 21, 2006 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Maria (Sano),</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, Sano, with all that you are going through at the present time you do feel very young, and very small, very helpless. So since I cannot be there I send out my strongest desires and prayers that you will be able to go through all that is necessary to bring you back to reliable health and peace and strength. I thank God that you have Klaus with you. God our caring Father does make some wonderful experiences happen in our lives, even we never seem to be free of all worry and pain. And really it all began many years ago when Mary had to have her little Child in a cattle shed. That scene was certainly not very noticeable, for the poor are never really noticed, but what a tremendous happening for all of us individually. So much we can never fully appreciate it all. So lets just be thankful and keep trusting. The Father has been so good to me, blessed me throughout my life, kept me healthy and appreciated and loved. And I will pray when I offer my Mass on Christmas eve that the Father gives to you and Klaus the inner strength and love he put into the heart of that little baby born in that small, poor cattle shed. Remember - all our chances and opportunity for happiness began that night so many years ago. Merry Christmas - and may the New Year burst in wonderful good news to you both.</p>
			<p><strong>Love, Pa </strong></p>
			<p>Maria felt fairly satisfied in the community – but it was a very difficult move on her part to be fully relaxed and at ease in any place where she was to be with others. Living with many people who were very much concerned with themselves was not easy for her. The few people that she felt at ease with, with whom she could relax and might even begin to enjoy herself with ,were few because of her shyness. She would have liked to be with people but she did not easily find people who appreciated and wanted to make the effort to discover how warm and accepting she could be.</p>
			<p>Sometimes when there are discussions concerning former kids and how they fared with their personality’s attempt to find a passage through the serious problems tying them down in uncertainty and continuous doubt, we need to consider what they suffer or are suffering within themselves.</p>
			<p>Many times I experienced first hand the twists and contorted struggles that Maria went through as she struggled to eliminate from her mind the terrible fear and hesitations that she needed to put herself through in order to be present and in some way take part in the community activities and sharings.</p>
			<p>And she has left me with precious memories, memories I can be very thankful for. My life is so much richer because of the times I spent with her – morning walks together, swimming in a small pool at the resort down the road from ASV. The week being together in the small resort on an island on the coast of Germany, when I visited Germany, to check how she was doing after her time with me in India.</p>
			<p>It was while planning her marriage with Klaus that the cancer that was to bring about her death, struck her down. She died in 2007. Her husband wrote me a beautiful letter of her last struggle.</p>
			<p>Such beautiful memories she has left me with.</p>
			<p>“Dear Pa,</p>
			<p>My heart is full of gratitude thinking of our memories! I am being with you in spirit!</p>
			<p>Love Maria (Sano)”.</p>
			<p>I will always keep a special place in my heart for the beautiful memories of Maria, my Sano.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>hen Sundar came to me, not fully grasping the desire or the need to make changes in his personality, he could not fully accept the problems that were quite active in him.</p>
			<p>He had been given training in some way in office procedures, but he found it very difficult to fit in with the two or three other young men working in the office. He had great ambitions as a accountant, but his competence was very limited, even though he was very eager to learn. His competitive nature hindered his practice and he was unable to carry out his ambitions, including his desire for marriage.</p>
			<p>His uncle, who was his guardian, was unable to fulfill his demands, because his abusive language, unnecessary expenses and violence were very unacceptable.</p>
			<p>By being with the group in treatment he realized that he did have fairly good prospects if he worked on the problems that he had. He was able to give up his anger and was receptive although frightened because he really wanted to fit in well and be appreciated.</p>
			<p>Gradually his social awareness improved and he began to control his wasteful expenses and became receptive of his uncles directions. Through therapy he learned to fit into a team and to accept his place in the community, although there were disputes. After nearly 4-5 years of close living contact in ASV, he was able to function well and was accepted back for a regular job at his uncle’s office.</p>
			<p>I have appreciated the changes which he has made over the years, learning to act in a continuously growing mature manner and developing an ability to be aware and knowing himself. I am pleased how he has learnt to think and remain aware so that his thinking is settled and appropriate.</p>
			<p>I value the great efforts that he has made to understand me and build the attachment that he continues to have with me. His relationship with me has enabled him to become flexible and adaptable when necessary in any difficult situation.</p>
			<p>He continues to maintain our attachment which I now consider as one of close friendship.</p>
			<p>I have enjoyed putting together the various letters that I have written to him over the years, after he left ASV, which I believe were quite meaningful to him. Our correspondence ended up being a great source of happiness to me.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologize for the delay in sending this to you. I have been very busy this morning sending some letters out to people in Chandigarh - to Ajim’s father and others.</p>
			<p>Confidence is something a person will not think of very much, especially the confident person, for the confident person will just go along and do his work without reflecting that the work seems to be easy for him and that it seems to be done, quickly, or that he keeps getting new ideas which help him in his work. So notice those things that you can do easily. As you reflect you will realize that you are confident in doing those things.</p>
			<p>To increase your confidence be aware while you are doing the activities you need to do or especially enjoy doing. Have the sense that you are confident to do those things. It will give you a feeling of security, a sort of pride.</p>
			<p>I will write more if I have an opportunity this afternoon. All the best. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> can understand how you feel. Everything seems to be going on well, when you feel in charge of yourself and what you need to do and have strength to always take charge and follow what you have decided. Then you find you have made a mistake or been weak and haven’t followed through on the decisions you have made. I have often felt that way. I felt down within myself and tend to be depressed. But, I have learned that I have to be strong with myself, to take</p>
			<p>charge of my thinking and feeling. So, I think that I can be strong enough and not to feel down or depressed. So, I behave as when I am controlling my anger. When I may be very angry with someone and feel that I cannot express it as I would want to, I decide to keep my anger and not to speak out or tell the person. So, I keep control and agree to drop the anger for my own good - I would rather feel good than keep the anger. My main aim is that I still feel strong and calm with myself.</p>
			<p>Yesterday, we had a good day with parents and guests. There was lots of discussion, with the parents asking us to give them a day or two session on their own personal growth and how to handle their feelings and communicate with others. I feel happy that we had two full day’s session. We will have more.</p>
			<p>All the best.</p>

			<p class="text-center">Top of Form</p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> enjoyed speaking with you last evening. I can understand that your uncles will talk to you about getting ahead in certain ways. You can remember or think that relatives that you meet only now and again will say what they believe. They will probably believe that you should be moving ahead in the manner that they believe would be good for you. But that is only their opinion. They do not know what you are working on for your future when they speak. You have your plans and are working to become an auditor, you have chosen your line or profession, and on this you are definitely working. So you can let drop or ignore what the others are saying to you or proposing for you. Trust in yourself and your own planning, especially the plans that you have worked out with your father. </p>
			<p>Keep trusting in yourself and all that you can accomplish in your life. By losing so many kilos you know that you can accomplish what you set out to do. So carry on with your plans and do not allow yourself to be diverted by what others may say.</p>
			<p>I am going up to Valsad this week - flying up to Mumbai early Thursday morning - then afternoon train to Valsad and back to Mumbai by train early Monday morning and then flying back to Bangalore late Monday evening. Maybe we could meet on Monday. You are all right - keep going on well.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>e all of us have a long way to go before we can be the strong effective persons that we would like to be. Do not think I was always like I am today. It took many years of struggle for me to gain the confidence in myself that I have at the present time. I often felt that I was way behind other persons I was studying with, and especially other persons who were with me in the training to become the teacher I knew I had to become. And also when I was given the post of Headmaster in the school it took some time for me to learn how to organize the teachers and the students so the school could function in a manner that helped everyone attached to the school. But I did not become discouraged or put myself down through a lot of fears. No, I realized that I could learn what was necessary to be learned in order to have everything go smoothly. I never became discouraged but kept regularly telling myself that I could learn more and more, and feel good about my learning. We are all able to learn, and the learning process is not something I should avoid but enter into the learning process with determination and a rewarding feeling. A rewarding feeling comes to me as I gradually, slowly, step by step integrate those practice activities I have to learn. All the best to you. Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>hen you phone to me I feel my attachment to you being deepened, so you can phone me anytime, and on any matter or occasion. I realize that you have had a few difficult days and during this time you have been speaking with your uncle and have managed to be actively and positively involved with him, and that both of you now appreciate the way things have worked out together.</p>
			<p>You are learning and slowly integrating yourself into the office practices. Any person who is learning some new practices or skills has to accept that much of the knowledge will not be clear to him but will be clearer as he goes along and stays patient in his learning. So, the main word is “patient” which means I wait, while I believe that all the knowledge will come to me or be given to me, taught to me, as the time goes by.</p>
			<p>You will be actively learning all the time as your uncle is teaching you. So, you will be learning. Every person who is now in the office has gone through the slow process of learning, learning more and more as the days go by.</p>
			<p>I appreciate very much your trust in me. From my last visit, as I talked with you and your uncle as I took my lunch, I saw that you and your uncle can be very understanding together - that is very good and the goal of all therapy. Today we had our meeting with the kids and parents and I told everybody that the goal of all of our therapy is that the kids and parents / gaurdians will be able to stay open to each other, come to agreement because of their acceptance of each other.</p>
			<p>All the best to you.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone call yesterday. I appreciate hearing from you. And I am always ready to write to you - yes, and write about any matter that you may want me to write about. I realize that I should be writing to you more often, just to help you to realize that I am thinking of you and wish that you are feeling good with yourself and finding a meaning in your life. I would want you to grow in the strong belief in your great value as a person.</p>
			<p>I guess that is what I especially would want for you to have - a great value in yourself. Each and every person needs to reflect within himself or herself on the value that he places on his being this person now - this existing, living person who is conscious of himself and believes that he is accepted by at least one or two other persons, persons who are happy that he is living and interacting with them, just as you are realizing that I am accepting you, happy to know you and happy to share myself and my thoughts with you.</p>
			<p>I have good happiness and strength knowing that some other persons accept me, come to talk with me, want to know how I am feeling. So, within myself I am conscious of my accepting these other people, accepting you and so many kids that have been here in ASV during the last few years. When one of the kids who has been here writes to me, even though it may only be to ask some little advice or support, or just to say hello, I feel more confident, I feel good with myself and am ready to carry on the work that I am doing each day.</p>
			<p>So, confidence comes from that realization, the belief, the knowledge that I am accepted by some person, or some one or two persons, or many persons. And all of us need to have that experience that we are accepted by another person and so then we can believe in our self and be confident within our self. We learn to trust in our self, so that whatever happens to us, or whatever anyone might say to me I still feel good with myself, and do not need to become angry or argue with another person. We just remain confident within ourselves.</p>
			<p>All the best to you.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub : Being with people </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> appreciated your talking with me yesterday - your openness and trust is a very positive quality that you have. This quality will be of much help to you.</p>
			<p>I believe that I have some idea of the problem which you are facing. It is very difficult to find a way to become part of a group that are speaking together, especially when the people already know that you have some difficulty in your work or in feeling at ease with people. So, when a person is in this situation they have to be very aware of the reactions of the others, quietly trying to understand what their reactions are. You will need to know what the others are talking about, what are their interests and usual subjects of talk. So, I have to go slowly and wait until there is some sort of invitation, some sort of opening that allows me to enter into their conversation easily and smoothly.</p>
			<p>That is a skill that all people have to learn in order that they may join in any group for conversation, or begin to mix with others whom they are not close friends with. I guess the word I would need to use in describing this process is that it is a delicate process - I cannot move abruptly into a group. The English word is - I cannot barge into a group. So, unless I am invited into a group talking together I have to go slowly.</p>
			<p>Later, I can speak with one or other of the persons who talk together but again I cannot ask them what they were talking about, unless the person begins to tell me what they were talking about.</p>
			<p>We can talk more about this. Stay happy with yourself - you are doing well. All the best <strong>- Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Relating with People </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> regret that I am late in sending you this - I have been busy today. How do I break through to other people who do not accept me or who seem that they do not want to talk with me or have any relationship with me?</p>
			<p>I have to go slow and watch these persons without being open and looking at them all the time but just being aware of them and trying to get some idea of what sort of person the person is, what the person is like. Is he someone who laughs a lot, is he some one who is silent a lot? So, slowly I get some “feel” for the person. if I believe that he is very stiff or an angry person, then I go slow. If he is someone who laughs a lot and seems friendly then I can consider, “How can I be with this person?”</p>
			<p>But, you are an outsider to the fellows in the office, even though you work in the same office. They are not interested in having you as a friend or they may be interested but do not believe that they would like to be friends with you. One thing you can do - is to just feel within yourself, your attitude towards them - each one individually. You get some idea of how the person is when you try judging the way they talk and behave.</p>
			<p>And you begin to allow yourself to feel positive towards one of them or each of them. You sense positive feelings towards them slowly. Then you quietly wait - it will take days - until there is some recognition coming from one of them - he may greet you in the morning or ask you a question about yourself.</p>
			<p>Do not believe that they are always critical or negative towards you - just be quiet and watch them.</p>
			<p>It is easier with strangers that you meet in the gym or in roadside shops - then it may be possible to wish them well or ask them questions about how they are - or speak about what is the news in the newspaper - or talk about films - or cars - or buses. Just a few sentences back and forth between you and the person will begin to give you some confidence that you can communicate with other people.</p>
			<p>Believe that you are equal to any person - the other person may have more education or have some skill you do not have or seems to be more active and knowing. Remember that you are equal to that person, you are equal because he is a person and you are a person so you have a right to be as you are. And slowly you will come to accept that you are as good as anyone and have your rightful place anywhere.</p>
			<p>You can give me feedback on the above. Is it helpful and what you want ? All the best. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-right"><strong>Sub: Mistakes </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, we all make mistakes, sometimes we notice our mistakes, sometimes we do not notice our mistakes, sometimes other person’s do not notice our mistakes, sometimes other people do not notice their mistakes, sometimes we do not notice other person’s mistakes, sometimes we notice other person’s mistakes....</p>
			<p>All of this goes on all the time. So, we have to accept if people do not notice our mistakes, we have to accept if they notice our mistakes. And of course, there are times when we make mistakes and think we have not made a mistake, there are times when we have made a mistake and nobody notices it, and we haven’t, made a mistake and others think we have made a mistake.</p>
			<p>So, there are all sorts of combinations and situations. Is there any solution? There will be mistakes, unexpected and not deliberate. What to do? And what if the results of the mistake has an effect on me?</p>
			<p>Then I have to stop and think and make as good a judgment as I can. And I have to do this, no matter how I am feeling - whether I am feeling angry, sad or afraid.</p>
			<p>Now, the mistake can be serious, or it can be slight, not serious. When I come away from the coffee seller and I realize when I have walked a good distance down the street that the seller has made a mistake in not giving me the proper amount of change. What can I do? I let it pass. Why get into an argument?</p>
			<p>I go to the hospital for an operation and the new doctor who is supposed to remove my left cancerous foot makes a mistake removes my healthy right foot. What can I do? I can do many things, take him to court, demand compensation, etc.</p>
			<p>The trainer tells me to do a certain exercise that he hopes will help me lose weight. I gain weight even though I do not eat more food. What to do? I can believe he is doing his best, and he can never be sure. I give my own feedback to him which he accepts and follow my suggestions. Or he doesn’t agree with me and tells me to stay on the old exercise. I can walk out and go to another trainer.</p>
			<p>So, that is how life is. There are always doubts in every situation. Nothing is 100 percent valid and sure. So, we go along as best we can judge. It is necessary to be flexible, that is, stay open and ready to accept because most matters are not 100% sure. It is better to remain undecided so that we can remain open and friendly even though I would like it to be firm and decided. We always need to remain positive towards the other person.</p>
			<p>All the best. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am late in sending you this email- I had promised that I would send you an email some days ago - an email on the relations between people and how can we understand people and find the ways to be in contact with them, talking with them and working with them.</p>
			<p>Really the contact with people begins within myself. I have to have the confidence and acceptance of myself so that I can feel at ease within myself and ready to reach out to others. The confidence gives me the assurance that I can make contact with others - that I am as good as they are, I have to understand that they have their strengths and weaknesses, as no one is perfect. We are all the same. Some are more intelligent and seem to work faster and can talk easier. They may have different interests than I have. Still basically they want the same things in their life that I want - friends, success, etc.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>ay all be well. I believe that you can enjoy the accomplishments that you made in the past two years - or maybe even more time...You are finding the ways to obtain the smooth and pleasant experiences that you have always wanted to have in your life. And this is the result of your being patient, using your awareness and thinking, paying attention to the feelings and thoughts that come up within you and working out through your feelings and your attitudes the goals that you are organizing for yourself in your experiences with your uncle and other persons. In this way you are gaining in confidence and becoming more sure of yourself. Continue as you are doing - Love, <strong>Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your email. I am very happy to answer your mail. I will try to explain a bit how you move into the Negative Thinking. What happens is that you choose unconsciously to remain in such a stuck position. The problems arise when your uncle does not agree with you on your proposal. Try to think about many times in the past when your uncle has thought differently over some point and you have become upset. Or think of the times with me when you felt that I was disagreeing with you. You would feel angry and because of that your thinking would be blocked or stuck so that you did not have any thought that you had a choice to behave and talk differently.</p>
			<p>When a person is setting aside his feelings (realizing that he has strong feelings but does not act on his feelings but remains neutral or quiet) then he can easily think and so can decide what is the most helpful decision he can take about himself at that time so he can plan for his future and what will help him to be successful and friendly and respected by others.</p>
			<p>All the best to you, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your telephone conversation twice today - many thanks for making contact. Speaking with you over the phone is in many ways so much more meaningful than the simple emails although I also appreciate the communication that comes with the emails. It is always, in some manner, very enriching for persons to communicate with each other for the contact allows us to appreciate ourselves more simply because of the contact we have. We grow through our contact.</p>
			<p>And for that reason we, all of us, are frustrated when some individuals or groups of people stay distant and do not wish to communicate with us even though they may be working in the same office with us. It is the same as being pushed away, or discounted. Yes, this often happens when the people are from a different language group or tribe. What do we need to do then when people seem to stay away from us and do not want to speak with us, yet speak very much among the people of their group? Then, we need to be quite clear and acceptant of ourselves, or an individual must be clear about his own person, having a serious acceptance and trust in himself so that he can remain free within himself, convinced of his value as a person, fully aware of the process in his own thinking so that he reaffirms his confidence in himself and he does not become upset because of the way in which the persons now turn their backs on him or refuse to talk with him as they talk with each other. They show by their rejection that they do not want to share with him. In this situation a person needs to be strong and decide that he will not be disturbed within himself by their conduct. He will think of his own goodness and his worth and value to himself and the others who do accept him and talk openly and discuss openly matters with him.</p>
			<p>So, there you are Sundar. I hope this is fairly clear and not too long - All the best to you Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>any thanks for your email. I had made up an answer for you and then was distracted when Usha came in and before I could send it the power went off. I was writing to you about awareness, and the necessity of remaining open within ourselves to the reactions which we experience within ourselves at any time. For we are always reacting, that is being alive. We experience our life as we go along feeling, thinking, remembering, enjoying, being happy, being worried, being angry when someone snubs us or is not willing to allow us to talk - - - all many experiences that we have to go through the day. However, when we slow down our experiences, and notice our feelings and the reasons we are feeling as we are, then we can be in charge and decide how we are going to react, study the various options we have to think about, for options are always there no matter what we are feeling and thinking. Enough for now - may all be well for you. Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> will try to give you some ideas on the subject we have been talking about. The word consciousness is a word that helps to explain the word of awareness. When I am awake I am conscious and we say that I know what is going on in me. In other words I know that I am feeling, and that I can also be thinking. So I need always to let myself know the feelings that I am feeling. That is being conscious, being awake. I really cannot avoid the feeling that I am having. When I am conscious of the feeling then I can change the feeling to another feeling. And we talk about that next time. Right now I am going to Tara’s house for dinner.

It was an enjoyable conversation for me. You seem to be in good spirits which is something that I like to see - I like to see you being positive and enjoying your life. We need to pay attention so that we can enjoy our lives. Each of us will be aware of being in touch with our deep self, our deep feeling of being the person that we are. That feeling will give me confidence to be the person that I am. And this deep feeling of being strong and well and happy to be me, no one can take away from me because it is my conscious awareness of my self. Sometimes other feelings may come up in me that disturb me but I can always come back to my home base, to my being strong and accepting me within myself. All the best. Love <strong>Fr.

			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am sorry that I have taken so long over the past month or so in not keeping in closer touch with you through the email. I have been often thinking of you. On the difficulty that you are having with the other people in the office you will have to just let them be as they are. Unless they are open and talking with you there is probably no way that you can feel at ease communicating with them. They are living their closed circle and not interested in inviting you to join them. That is how people usually behave with people they have difficulty in taking into their closed circle. There is not much you can do at present. But do not allow them to put you down. Believe in yourself and your place in the office. You are all right. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologize for not writing to you over the last many days. The excuse I have to make is that I have had so many matters to take care of here.

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone call last evening. I agree - it is not easy. Life often does not come as a happy package to us, like some sort of Valentine gift that is all sweets and roses. Rarely does life come smoothly and just as we would want it to fit our wishes and needs of the moment. So, we need a wonderful strength inspired by our courage and our persistent belief that our life will be better in the future. In some ways it will be better, because I shall know myself better - I will realize that I can always in some way or other generate some new energy by talking with the people who understand me and support me. And I hope, keep hoping that there will be a positive change that will benefit me and others. Here in ASV when difficulties for me come up such as when there are very little funds, or kids keep acting out and not getting well, or some outsiders negatively criticize all that we do here in the community, the only thing I can do is think and remember the past and the good kids such as you that we have had in the past. Then I say to myself that is all worth it. And I trust that tomorrow, the day following or some time in the next week there will be a change. So let us both keep hoping for a better future. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: good Evening </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>e had a conversation on the phone earlier this evening. I guess I would describe the subject as being about what method to follow within myself when I have a sense that the person who is speaking to me or calling me has some sort of negative intention to agitate me, or provoke me in some manner, or speak about me in a distasteful or disrespectful manner. Against such a behaviour by another person I must be very strong and not allow myself to become disturbed or upset by the other person. He or she may have a negative intention - I may pick up a sense of this negative intention. Hence I have to be on my guard and protect my self, keeping myself composed and steady within my thinking of myself, realizing that I may be or can be quite angry at the person but at the same time controlling myself and not allowing my self to become upset by his or her remarks. I have nothing but a very low opinion of the person who tries to provoke me in this way. Hence I need to protect myself from within myself by not becoming upset by the words or action of the other - I protect myself from within by keeping my strong belief in myself and acceptance of myself and so I do not allow the other person to make me not-OK. Nobody can make me not-OK except myself.</p>
			<p>I do that when I stop believing in myself and loving myself. All the best, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>02.04.2008 Time: 15.33 pm </strong></p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Message </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologize for not sending this message before now. Our telephone lines were cut by the men laying the new water pipelines in the village - all the surrounding houses were also cut off. Now, the main way to avoid being upset by whatever anyone says to me I have to be very aware, very strong and determined within self. I need to be strong, very strong within myself so that when someone says something to me I do not react at all. I stay calm and steady, convinced that I am not going to allow this person to cause me to be moved or upset or bothered by what they say to me. I need to stay cool and not react and try to reply to them immediately. I stop and give myself time to think. Even if what the person says makes or moves me to feel immediately very angry I remain calm and do not give any angry answer. I keep quietly in charge of myself to show the other person that I am very much in charge and that I am not allowing the other to put me down or to feel bad. My motto is “I have really thick skin and what you say bounces off of me.” Meanwhile I am thinking within myself whether I want to answer this person or not. I am not going to give them the advantage of putting me down or upsetting me. I remain in control of myself and then I decide how I want to feel about what they have said. I will not try just yet to try to protect myself and I will within myself renew my belief that I am in charge of me and not the other person. The other person cannot dictate to me how I am supposed to feel. I will stay always in charge of me.</p>
			<p>This demands an effort on my part but it is a way of showing my strength quietly and exerting my power to be in charge of myself. Remember the times you may have been angry and shouted at me still remained quiet and spoke only as I wanted to, choosing my words carefully, still being in charge of me. Let me know what you think of this.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t is important not to be upset by the words which people use or say to you. I will give you something from a book which some one gave me.</p>
			<p>The word is not just a sound or a written symbol. The word is a force; it is the power you have to express and communicate, to think, and thereby to create the events in your life. You can speak. Which other animal on the planet can speak? Many would say that the word is the most powerful tool you have as a human; it is the tool of magic. But like a sword with two edges your word can create the most beautiful dream, or your word can destroy everything around you. One edge is the misuse of the words which creates a living hell. The other edge is the impeccability of the word, which will only create beauty, love and heaven on earth.</p>
			<p>Some times what is said to us can enter our mind and change our whole belief about something - maybe for a good purpose, maybe for a bad purpose. You may believe you are stupid and have believed this for a long time. This is something you have agreed with me at times. You may do something and think to yourself, “I wish I were smart, but I must be stupid or I wouldn’t have done that.” But one day someone may be attentive to you and hears you saying you are stupid. But then the person says to you “But you are not stupid”. And he gives you some reasons to show you are not stupid. You believe what the persons says and you make a new agreement with yourself. As a result you no longer feel or act stupid.</p>
			<p>You change your belief. Beliefs are very strong - they can make or break us. Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

May you be at ease, assured of yourself and realizing all that you can do today. Keep that trust in yourself, the trust that you can handle whatever comes in your path today. Yes, self-acceptance gives me the base within myself that enables me to find myself secure and alive to be able to form my life, to choose the thoughts and words and actions that will give me the confidence to become the person whom I want to become, to become the person that some way I dream of becoming on my own even though other people may not have the same confidence. But I can become as I want myself to become. I let other people be as they are, I can go along on my own, looking after myself, feeling confident in myself. I realize that I am in charge of my self so I can choose who I will be. I am glad that you are you and glad to know you. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>ay all be well - keep your thinking clear, and your feelings cool, and be ever ready to go with what appears to be the best solution, the solution that is most likely to give you strength and peace. And we have to go through this same manner of being aware and of keeping alert, open to the other person I am talking with, or the other people around me.</p>
			<p>How do I keep my thinking clear? By remaining calm and giving myself time to reflect within myself as I remember what I wanted from the other person at this time - and then I need to make sure the other person is aware of my asking him or her for what I am wanting.</p>
			<p>So, keep your self open even though you feel nothing seems to be going right for you. In some time the positive outlook will come back to you.</p>
			<p>I am sorry that I have not sent you any email for many days. May all be well for you. Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

The more you concentrate on learning as much as you can about accounting and business procedures for accounting and auditing, the more confidence you will have within yourself and the more people will recognize you for your knowledge. That is where I would like you to reach - that you will have a knowledge that other people will recognize and will accept you for that knowledge - you will be respected as a talented person.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>ll the best to you - I have been thinking about you after you phoned me this morning. I do not know very much about investments as I have not had any investments in my life and never had any money that I could invest. I do know that people invest their money so that they make the money they do have earn more money for them. That is the reason the very rich people become richer - as they earn money using the money that they already have. The story is often told of the old man who buried in the ground the money that he had hoping it would grow - but when he dug it up he found that the amount was the same as he had previously buried.</p>
			<p>In order to invest money a person must have some extra money and then must be aware of what banks or securities or bonds or stocks will earn the most money from his original investment.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone call this morning - I appreciate your telling how you are doing, what are your thoughts. You are doing well and I realize that each day has some different atmosphere often for you. I believe that during the sleep we have each night, many different thoughts or memories may come up in your mind without waking us up or our being aware of them, but they register with us just the same. And if these thoughts contain some negative content then this will influence us, even though we do not wake up or do not remember having the thoughts consciously in our mind. Because of this when we wake up and gradually become aware of ourselves during the morning we may slip into some negative feelings without being fully aware of the reasons we are feeling as we are feeling. And something may cause us to experience some negativity, some negative feeling and this may cause us to become a little depressed or as they say, “a little off colour” , or not my usual bright self.</p>
			<p>Then I have to again take charge of my self, take control of my thoughts and feelings - get back my confidence in myself, renew my positive description of myself, remember my positive or good qualities, remember people who accept me and are happy with me. I give myself positive strokes, try and discover what good actions I have to do today, take charge of my thought - be positive towards myself. I look ahead to what good and rewarding experiences I might have during the new day. Believe in my goodness and strength to be me, the person I want myself to be. Not allowing myself to be in any manner depressed.</p>
			<p>Keep building a firm, clear cut, assured, beneficial, convinced, hopeful, progressive, secure personality each day. All is possible for you, I am with you, supporting you always.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p>I appreciate very much your awareness. Awareness means that I am conscious of what I am thinking and feeling and also what others may be saying to me, or how they are behaving towards me. I believe that you are constantly aware of how others behave towards you, especially your uncle, since much of your important interactions are with him. It is good that you are realizing that very often he is negative and critical. You have to rely very much on your patience and strength. Someday we will have to sit down together with him and discover a smooth method of communication between him and</p>
			<p>you so that the discussions can be more easy and with less negative feelings. All the best. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

I liked talking with you yesterday about how each of us in his own way finds the strength and confidence in himself to develop his own acceptance of self and belief in self.</p>
			<p>Each of us is “OK” only because we have the confidence in our belief in ourself that “I am OK” and no one can take that belief away from us.</p>
			<p>When I take the time to think about my self, I know that I accept the experience of being me - my awareness of self and the person who I am. I do not look at or think of or refer to what I can</p>
			<p>do or the talents or training or education I may or may not have. All of those things are something I HAVE - those things do not make me BE ME. I am ME and I am OK just because I am alive and aware of my SELF. So, I can be happy just being MYSELF.</p>
			<p>Sure, I can study and DO many things but those things do not make me OK. I am OK because I am ME. That is enough. No one can take that OKNESS away from me no matter what they say or do to me.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> want to send you some lines, a short message, a few words, because of the chat we had on the phone last evening. My message this morning would be - feel good to be the person you are - be aware of yourself as a person - we all have an awareness of ourselves. But if we keep insisting too much on our difference with any other person we lose the sense of awareness which gives me my awareness of my self and my trust in being the person who I am, myself.</p>
			<p>My guru - the man whose book I have read most and think about most - Ken Wilber - writes as follows - “...the separateself sense, is an affective one. That is, it is propped up not just with concepts (with thoughts about myself) but by the emotions (that is, my feelings).</p>
			<p>And the primal emotion (first and main feeling) of the ego, according to the teaching is fear followed by resentment. As the Upanishads put it, “Whenever there is other, there is fear.”</p>
			<p>In other words, when we split seamless awareness into a subject versus and object, me versus someone else, I against the other person, me not agreeing with someone...then that self feels fear, and the reason is simple and can be understood - because there are now so many “others”, so many other persons in front of me, some many persons in my way, so many “others” out in front of me, so many I have to deal with who can harm my sense of my self, my acceptance of my self, my belief in what is good for my self.</p>
			<p>Out of this fear grows resentment.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>n a way what we discussed yesterday and what we discussed today can be considered quite similar. We seem to be talking about how we can take part in a discussion or manage to get into a discussion when we feel that we are being left out - as you felt this afternoon when your uncle seems to have decided to make the changes and did not bring you into the discussion. In order to get into any discussion that is already started - or even already decided - I have to be very soft in suggesting that I have something to say on the subject that is being discussed and decided. If it is too late or seems to be already decided I have to think about what can be done - what are my views, how I want to say - be accepted. That depends and is different in every discussion. That is a problem. Each situation will be different and I have to be careful so that what I want to say or want to add will be accepted. This is long and complicated - and so is getting into a discussion when I want to discuss something that seems already decided.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t is important that you don’t become worried whenever there is any fear coming into your feelings. Remember that the fear is only a feeling. Fear is not a decision and decisions are not based on fear - no decisions are made because of fear. First of all I have to come to the middle, to the place where there is no fear, then I can take a decision. I may come to cross a busy street - then I begin to feel fear about crossing. So, I realize my fear.</p>
			<p>I can do any of three things –</p>
			<p>I can say “I am afraid, so if I run quickly across it will be best, then I’ll be on the other side.” But that is a very wrong thing to do as I may be hit by a car as I rush across.</p>
			<p>I can say “I will wait till my fear goes, then I will go. But then I may have to remain a long time before my fear goes so I may never be able to get across the street'.</p>
			<p>I can say “I will think about my options, may be there may be a way to get to my destination without crossing this busy street.” This sounds like a good choice.</p>
			<p>We’ll talk more about this - it is an important point. We must always give time to thinking. All the best. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am sorry that I haven’t sent this email to you before this - I have been very busy these past few days. I have had to meet with four different families that are wanting to admit their daughters into ASV and also explain to staff all that took place in Chandigarh and Delhi. We released the 20-minute DVD on Athma Shakti. On Monday when the office staff is here I will send you a copy. I will ask you to send me Rs. 500/- some time to cover the costs of making this DVD. It is well made and will be entered in film festivals. The man who made the film has already won an award from WHO for a previous film he made.</p>
			<p>About being with others - or talking with others - or understanding the other person, it is best to remain at ease and open as the other person is talking and at the same time be aware of my feelings and reactions but also to stay cool and open to what the other is saying. Then when he or she finishes I will respond calmly and moderately and in an easy tone of voice so that the other will be open to listen to what I am saying. I will not try to push what I want to say but speak about my reasons for saying what I am saying. Then I wait for the reaction of the other person, listening to his explanation.</p>

I am very happy that you have had such insights in the past week or so - and the good remarks you have made about the film. It has turned out much better than I could have hoped. It says much about ASV and in a very clear and bright way. In my talk to the parents who had come to our meeting yesterday I told them that the film gave a good idea of the spirit of ASV and what we do here. But it also does not do much to portray the other activities taking place in ASV and are also so very important in the treatment given in ASV. We do not mention being in the corner in the film. Nor do we mention how a person has to “deal” with the community when he or she has done something that is not appropriate for the community. Nor do we mention how much time is spent sorting out disagreements. So, many various items that are necessary if the community is to work out successfully.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> thank you very much for your hospitality yesterday - the discussions, your taking me to lunch, dropping me to the airport. I enjoyed the time with you. I am sorry that you became somewhat upset from the manner in which your uncle spoke to you, or what he said to you. When I am speaking with someone, discussing with a person about any matter, I need to remain steady within myself, not becoming upset or being depressed or becoming upset because of the words that he uses, or the tone of his voice, or the subject he is talking about. If I remain cool, then I can give an answer to him in a way that will cause him to reflect - I will remain cool, steady, not showing any change of feeling, remaining quietly in charge of myself.</p>
			<p>Maybe you may remember that when you were here and you would become upset with me and were angry at me, I used to stay calm and let you speak as I remain calm and steady within myself. I realized at that time that it is not helpful if I were to shout back in an angry manner - from that way of proceeding we both would have ended up getting nowhere towards a solution. In order for some solution to be found in a discussion we have to remain cool and steady. Only then can we think, that is, be aware of what is the goal of our discussion. When a person becomes angry at me in a discussion, I realize that it will be impossible for me to have him think and change his way of thinking and come to some agreement with me.</p>
			<p>You have seen people arguing on the street and never coming to any solution. Because of their anger they will not listen to each other. One of them has to be fairly quiet and possessed and then the other may pay attention and slowly change his manner of speaking.</p>
			<p>I remain without being angry. It is a special skill that all people need to learn, people can do it even when they are under any worry or pressure.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> call what I will try to make more clear in this email - handling interactions. By handling I mean being able to keep a conversation, or any communication that I am having with another person going on until both of us are more or less satisfied with the interaction and feel all right in closing off the conversation - and feeling at ease and good enough, even if I am not fully satisfied with the conversation meaning I feel positive enough about our conversation, quite satisfied that I understand what the other person was telling and his feelings as he spoke - so both of us have expressed what we want to say and have come to some agreement. We can both feel that we have reached a point of mutual understanding.</p>
			<p>For this to happen both of us need to be ready to be aware of the feelings that I and he are experiencing while we are having this interaction. We need to both be aware of our feelings and the reasons why we are feeling as we are feeling. This is most important, otherwise we will not be able to discuss openly, for if one is angry and does not realize that he is angry and the level of his feelings then he will speak in a manner that will not be open to consider what I am wishing for him to understand about me and my viewpoint - the thoughts and feelings that are within my mind at present. If I have a sense and believe that he is not open or is coming from what I believe is a negative standpoint then I must realize the feelings I am experiencing and find some way of expressing myself quietly in order to make him understand that I really do not agree with him, and slowly let him know that I do not agree with him. And then I ask him if we can quietly discuss in order to help both of us, so we keep our understanding or open communication between us.</p>

			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t is very late so I may not be long in writing as it is late and I have been busy all day meeting with various people.</p>
			<p>What I would like to say to you this evening concerning our interactions with people is that we have to able to stay quite alert as we stay working with persons who are involved in the same work as we are doing and so we have to interact with them quite often and have to come to some understanding and acceptance of each other in order for the work between us to go through smoothly. I myself must be steady and sure of myself within myself - if I am too nervous or afraid that the other person will be negative and not accepting of me then I will usually have some ill feelings towards the fellow. These feelings I must brush aside and trust in myself that I am all right and a good person, not allowing myself to become upset from the fact that we do not fully agree with each other. If I am quietly working with him, not letting my fear of him, or my interest decline or feel bad towards him, then things may go on fairly well. I will remain open, sure of myself, trusting myself, not being upset by any gestures or remarks he might make. This will take great patience but it will gradually work as he will pick up my smooth feelings and probably be quiet and keep supporting me quietly.</p>
			<p>This working together takes patience and a quiet strength of being quietly believing in my okayness Love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>We were to talk about being able to carry on when people do not seem open or responsive to the situation that I am trying to explain to them. I realize that they seem to have rejected my position or seem to be putting me down by not answering my requests. Then I have to be very strong within myself and not become upset - I must remain in charge by reflecting on how I can find out more information or discover the reason the person is speaking as they are speaking. Maybe I should just walk away without saying that I am the one suffering by the manner in which they are speaking. I must always remain the boss of me and how I am going to react or feel.

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone calls which you made to me today. I was glad to receive them. And I liked the way in which you were talking about having positive thoughts and negative thoughts that lead you to take decisions which have positive or negative relationships with people or which cause you to feel upset and negative or feel good and active and relaxed. I myself usually talk about attitudes. An “attitude” is defined in the dictionary as a way of regarding life, the world around me in which I live or the events or happenings that happen. With the attitudes we have, we make ourself realize and be aware of how we feel in any situation or with any people we have to live with or have anything to do with.</p>
			<p>We have attachments to people whom we meet or with whom we have work or business with. We form these attachments because we want them. For they help us not to be insecure. So we have attitudes towards these people - some positive attitudes making us feel good or negative attitudes making us to feel not good. Then the thoughts spring from these or come forth from these attitudes into our thinking and next we may make our decisions about the person or work or anything else.</p>
			<p>I’ll need to explain this more so it is easy to understand. The main aim is to have control over the positive and negative thoughts. All the best to you. <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, I believe that you are doing well. I admire your resilience in that you can shift your energy when you let yourself take some time and reflect on what you have thought or said or did. And as you do this, you become aware of the attitudes that you are coming from and then you have the courage to shift your thinking and then shift your feelings as you may wish to fit the situation. This is acting in a really mature manner and makes me realize that you are developing very strong cognitive skills. A cognitive skill is a way of being aware and knowing myself and how I am thinking and how I understand that my thinking is settled and appropriate. With this skill you can take your place in social situations, that is, in situations where it is necessary that you have to live and meet and talk and take action with other people. Resilience means that you have the ability to be flexible, adaptable, adjusting when necessary to the present situation. You are doing well. Love, <strong>Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> apologize for not sending this before. I have been occupied here yesterday and this morning. I will try to explain what I was talking about over the phone. The main point I wished to point out is that I can differ with what someone is saying to me and yet stay cool, thinking and aware of the differences between the way we both think. I can keep what I am thinking about the differences in our attitudes and thoughts yet still remain open to the other person. When I want the other person to be aware of the differences between us, I have to keep aware of my feelings and not to allow the feelings cause us to be set apart from each other. Only then can we come to realize that we are understanding each other but from different points of view, with different feelings and attitudes.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>ll the best to you for the year which is just beginning - may it be a special, really new year, for you. May you be able to experience a new strength in your ability to understand the many different interactions that you will be having with people throughout this year. The interactions that we have with people are usually different most of the time - we have the connections with others for various reasons. And these interactions are usually different from each other, and with different people with whom we are connecting for various reasons, we need to be ready and open to understand what they are trying to convey to us by talking with us, or trying to give us information us about something, we need to be open and aware of the purpose of the interaction that we are having. If they want information, I give them the information. If they are giving me information I stay open and consider what they are saying to me.</p>
			<p>At the same time in all cases I have to be aware or conscious of my reactions to what they are saying to me. I need to consider my reactions and judge whether they are appropriate reactions or not. My reactions need to fit into the conversation in order to keep the back and forth of the conversation flowing as we talk. Only then can I be sure that I am responding in a way that the other person can understand me so he can explain to me or support me or help me or share with me more of what he wishes to say to me and then it will be more easy for me to ask questions and tell the person what I do not understand or what I hear them say to me.</p>
			<p>This is all very complicated but is the necessary way that interactions must move back and forth between two people.</p>
			<p>Within myself I have to stay open, listen carefully, and not react in any negative manner until I am sure of the reason the person is speaking in the manner in which they are speaking to me. All the best to you, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone call this morning. There is one important reaction that we need to be able and free to use at any time when we are with someone who challenges me or is in any way using words I do not agree with or negative words. I need to “keep my cool”. Keeping my cool means I do not answer back or retaliate or show my self angry immediately. I say something that comes from our awareness that I need to quietly and slowly let the person realize that I do not agree with them but not by saying clearly “I do not agree.” If I say “I do not agree” immediately or “I do not like what you said” the other may be upset and angry right away. I need to think and get the feel of what level of anger or how this person may be trying to bully me or push me down. So in some manner I keep away from starting some sort of strong argument.</p>
			<p>I reflect and try and decide what are the possibilities I have to avoid the bad feelings arising and myself being disturbed by the other person. I remain in some manner in charge of the situation, not just reacting to the other person’s nasty words or statements. I do not allow the other person to push me down or make me into the bad person. I keep my confidence and decide within myself how to avoid a bigger difference or fight.</p>
			<p>What I am doing by this method is taking care of myself, keeping myself OK. All the best, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">F</span>irst I must apologize, as you have requested me to send you an email yesterday. However, there was a problem with my computer here - one plug had come out of the socket. And when I had it fixed this morning there were various mails I had to read and send.</p>
			<p>Thanks for speaking with me after you returned home. Your trip was really a great pleasure for me - I enjoyed having you here with me. I guess it was the manner in which you were so clear and attentive as we went through the various papers that had been sent. You are openly aware of the various thoughts and ideas that need to be examined and spoken about. Your understanding of yourself and the ability to speak in a responsible and meaningful manner shows clearly that you have been able to function in a manner that brings you into the right contact with the people you are mixing with or talking with. Keep growing in that understanding - reflecting (going over within your mind what the other person is saying and how you will respond to that person) - taking care to ask the right questions of the other person in a cool, calm voice so that then problems can be solved.</p>
			<p>Yes, I am very happy that you have come this time. My door is always open to you. May all be well with you. Love, Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Problem </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>hen there is a problem - I believe the person must always go first to the reception who is usually responsible for the scheduling of the time for the session. So, if there is a mix-up then I have to keep my cool, not become immediately angry but report to the receptionist who is the one then in charge - I give her the difficulty and expect her to solve it for me. There is no use becoming angry. I can tell the receptionist that I am not happy with the arrangement that has not been made and tell her of my discomfort. If the receptionist does not listen to me then I decide to speak again more strongly explaining my point.</p>
			<p>It is the organization that probably made the mistake and you can tell them of your displeasure that they have not scheduled you at a better time or for a course that suits you. Mix ups can always happen but the level of my upset will depend on the seriousness of the course or the amount of discomfort given to me by the mistake.</p>
			<p>Good luck to you in the course - I hope that they become more efficient in their organizing. All the best, Dad</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>hanks for your phone call this morning. I hope that I can write something that will be of help to you. I guess one thing all of us need to remember when we are speaking about interactions between us. We interact with one another for many reasons. We may want to exchange information, for example, I want to tell you which team won the cricket match, or that I have taken up a new job. Or on the bus I may want to know if the bus stops at a certain place.</p>
			<p>When you came for the course you needed to know about the class and when the teacher would be speaking with you. Because this was not clear you were dissatisfied and your reaction was OK and valid. So, you had to go to the receptionist to find out. You were looking for the correct information.</p>
			<p>You did well because you kept your cool even if you felt in some manner upset and disappointed when you found out that something was not right. You experienced discomfort - you comfort was gone, vanished and so you had to worry which no one likes to do. You needed an explanation and calmly asked for an explanation, something you always have a right to. And you did not show your anger or become upset - you kept your cool and asked for an explanation. You wanted people to understand your difficulty. We always want the other person to understand just what we are wanting, we want them to give us an explanation. We want to be satisfied within our mind that we are being recognized and being shown good service. We want to feel satisfied and this is our right.</p>
			<p>Whenever we are paying for a service we want to be satisfied. In your case, in the office in Nagpur you want to be recognized and you want everything to be explained to you - so that you can understand and feel satisfied.</p>
			<p>All the best to you – Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Sorry for the delay </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> first regret that I have not replied to you since you asked me to write. You are doing well and I believe you are thinking about yourself in the correct manner and also you seem to be paying attention to how you want to be in your interactions with others. You seem to pay attention to your interactions with your uncle and keep open as is necessary.</p>
			<p>And so you are building your confidence. What is “confidence”? I believe it is a decision that you take about yourself when you decide that you have a proper view of the correctness of your thoughts and attitudes and feelings. By “correctness” I mean that what you are deciding and feeling is appropriate in the present situation, and would be accepted as correct and helpful by most people.</p>
			<p>The feeling of confidence is like feeling sure and capable of being able to be with others and understanding others - being sure that you can speak in a manner that others understand you and will agree with you since you understand them also.</p>
			<p>When you feel confident you will find the strength to be you. All the best, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>30.04.2010 Time: 16.46 pm </strong></p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Reg. I have not understood this paragraph </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">C</span>onfidence - will mean that a person has trust in himself or herself he believes that he can go along smoothly doing what he has to do. He believes that he can do what has to be done. He believes he can accomplish or finish what he is setting out to do.</p>
			<p>He is confident when he is almost certain that he can do it. A batsman believes he can make a good score, and this means he is confident. The confident person feels sure that he can do what he has to do.</p>
			<p>You become confident when you do the same action correctly again and again. A confident person will do well in his job because he knows all that has to done.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Staying Calm </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> would say that both you and your uncle need to remain calm when you tend to think and not say, a remark or a sentence that is an attempt to overpower the other person quickly and sternly by the words or the expressions that you say or shout.</p>
			<p>Once you shout or raise your voice, you have “lost it” as we say - the smooth thread of the speaking together is cut and so there is no longer any openness for quiet listening to the reasons the other person is saying in the talking together.</p>
			<p>It is best that you both stop for “time out”, and reflect on the purpose of quietly talking together.</p>
			<p>Remember you are both worth much to each other and you really desire to deepen your relationship for you depend on each other now to find meaning in your lives.</p>
			<p>The greatest built-in gift we have as persons is our “consciousness”. Our consciousness has a built-in intentionality for our good and our life. We are made to live together and be friends always being conscious of the other - we need each other. We must ask ourselves - what is my intention? It is to be together and understand each other and help each other. But it takes an exceptional amount of calm energy and exertion within our selves — staying cool - and actively controlling my thinking and reactions that are present in my consciousness.</p>
			<p>I have to stay aware in my consciousness and not blast off or shout, for then I lose my conscious awareness of myself and nothing will be gained if I do not stop and slow down.</p>
			<p>This may seem complicated but it is always a question of awareness of what is going on in my consciousness. All the best to both of you, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Belief </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">O</span>n many days as I begin to organize my thoughts and feelings for the day, I will experience often different sorts of feelings. and various ideas or thoughts come to my mind.</p>
			<p>Some days I feel quite enthusiastic, feeling good to be me and also feeling ready to do whatever I can to discover some way of seeing how I can cover the most necessary letters or requests or phone calls that come to me and require me to pay attention to and do something about.</p>
			<p>Some days go well. some do not go so well. Some days, all is smooth. Other days there are questions and difficulties arising.</p>
			<p>Some of the difficulties can be resolved in a fairly easy manner and so I feel quite positive and content that all seems to be going well.</p>
			<p>Yet on some days there are complications that come up, difficulties come in the way of smoothly getting something organized or some problems solved.</p>
			<p>Then I begin some times to wonder - is it all worth it? why doesn’t life work smoothly? why do these difficult problems in dealing with some persons come up? why are there difficulties?</p>
			<p>I know that I cannot quit - I have to go on - I have to find solutions even though a solution doesn’t come easily.</p>
			<p>So, I carry on - I keep going - I believe that I can come thorough the difficulties - but I have to be determined - I have to be firm to go on - I have to push myself ahead.</p>
			<p>And if I continue usually some sort of solution will come. It comes from my determination to try all the methods possible. All the best -<strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Control </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> will use the word “control”. Many people consider the word “control” as a negative word, that it limits a person, that it causes them to step back and do or say what they were going to say, or as policemen on the street control people and do not allow them to do what they want to do. I am not using the word control in that negative way here. I mean I must be aware, conscious of what I am thinking and what I am feeling at the present moment because of my interaction with another person as we are discussing something one of us or both of us are interested in. I am responsible to control my feelings when talking, the words I use when talking, the reasons I put forward when talking. And also I must give time for the other to speak, listen carefully, and only after listening to reply. No interrupting.</p>
			<p>All during the discussion the two of us are having I need to keep my voice in a steady low speech tone and volume - even if I become upset or angry or if I seem to be upset or angry or afraid at the manner in which the other person may have spoken to me or the matter they may have spoken to me about as they spoke to me.</p>
			<p>If I disagree or am upset at what the other person is saying, then I can answer in a quiet easy manner, explaining my discomfort at what the person is saying or how they are saying it. And in the same easy tone I can tell the person of my disagreeing with them and my reasons for disagreeing. And then I wait openly for whatever the other persons is replying to me. If the other speaks sharply or in an aggressive way then I wait quietly till they finish and again I give my reasons for differing with the person, keeping my voice in the middle - not loud or harsh - but clear and steady.</p>
			<p>The important aspect in all this is for each of the persons to remain cool. Then they discuss what they both give as reasons and stay open as they do it so that they can come to some conclusion or agreement that will satisfy both of them as much as possible.</p>
			<p>There is no question of either person winning or losing - but of both leaving the discussion with each person having a better appreciation of the other person - no matter what they may have been talking about.</p>
			<p>All the best to both of you. I wish you to have many good discussion between yourselves.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: You are Ok </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am sorry that you did have the problem that you have spoken to me about - the problem that you had when seeking to speak with the member of the staff you mentioned. That did not have to happen if there was more understanding and acceptance.</p>
			<p>You wanted and expected to have a talk alone between the two of you. And that expectation of yours I believe should have been recognized. When you asked for the time to spend together, it should have been only the two of you together. Then it would have been a good talk, something you wanted for yourself. Once there were a couple kids called in then it was all right for you to feel as you did and leave.</p>
			<p>Then you could have left it at that, not said anything and not asked to talk later. Then there would have been no problem or bad feeling for you.</p>
			<p>But, somewhere within you, you wanted to be proved correct, or to try to make the other person aware of how you felt about the kids being called in the first meeting. Within yourself, you were quite angry but did not realize how angry you were. So, you tried to make the other person aware of your anger, So you tired to call on the phone again and again. But that was causing you to be more and more frustrated.</p>
			<p>That is why I said it would have been better for you to drop the whole matter, not trying to call on the phone. Had you dropped it right away you could have felt free and relaxed, not bothering about the other person, as you went on your way without being bothered by the other person.</p>
			<p>If ever I am insulted or badly spoken to by another person I can walk away because I am deciding that I will feel as I want to feel -deciding to give up my anger because I will feel free to feel as I wish to feel. I will say to myself - “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.” Let the other person think what he wants about me - I will decide how I want to feel - I will not allow you to spoil how I am feeling today - “Say and do what you like towards me - I will look after myself.” “I will protect myself, and stay happy being me.”</p>
			<p>I hope this is all right - you can ask me any questions you want about this. Love, Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Being Free </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> will try to give you some idea on how our minds work, what we often say is our conscious inner life - our awareness - or in some other words - “how our mind works, or how our thinking works”. And together with our thinking we have our feelings. The feelings that we are having, or experiencing, or aware of are usually the first experiences we become aware of - we are feeling fear, or anger, or sadness, or happiness - one of those feelings will be within us at any time. Which feeling arises from within me is caused</p>
			<p>by the thought that I am having in my consciousness, or we might say my conscious mind.</p>
			<p>Once I am aware of the feeling I am having, then by thinking more about the thoughts that I am having in my awareness, I can if I am strong and in charge of my mind and my feelings - then I can -if I wish I can stop allowing the feeling to disturb me - that is, not allow the feeling to stay with me but decide to not allow the feeling to cause me to be upset or more angry or more afraid.</p>
			<p>When you had such a strong feeling of anger against the person you kept the feeling within your mind because you also kept the memory of how you remembered she had treated you against your wish.</p>
			<p>If you were to drop the feeling and come to a quiet, peaceful mind then you had to stop the feeling of anger and be calm and settled and at peace within your mind.</p>
			<p>It is possible always if you love and care for yourself to stop and change any feeling you have. You can always decide to feel less angry, or less fear or less sadness, and in the place of any of those feel at peace or happy within yourself.</p>
			<p>In this manner you are in charge of yourself and what you are going to feel, although at the beginning you may have felt angry or fear or sadness. You can be free although it may be very difficult some times when you feel very upset over something or at someone.</p>
			<p>When your negative feelings are very strong and upsetting you it may be very difficult to give up the feelings. If I keep the feelings I may speak or act in a negative manner towards the other person and this will cause the other person to reject me.</p>
			<p>All the best to you, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>
			<p class="text-right"><strong>14.07.09 Time: 17.13 pm </strong></p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Awareness </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> will give you some of the thoughts that I think will be of help to you. In all of our living we need to be conscious and aware so that we may be fully present in each moment of our present living, especially when we are interacting with another person or other persons. </p>
			<p>‘Being fully present’ is when we watch our mind as though it were a film projected on a screen. We then become more aware of what is involved at the time or the moment in which we are present. The life that I experience, that I feel, gives me the awareness that is like a continuing TV serial ,an ongoing process within me concerning myself, my beliefs, my attitudes, my thoughts, my feelings, my memories, my skills, my knowledge, my desires, my habits.</p>
			<p>So, I am in a continuing process of following my becoming aware, of living my experience of being me.</p>
			<p>I can be aware and experience all of it as it passes within me. What passes may move one to speak in a certain manner. I may move to decide to act in a certain manner - or go to a movie, or go for some food in a shop, or to read a newspaper, or talk to a friend, or avoid meeting some one I do not like. Each action follows from my thinking about the decision of what I am going to do, what I am going to say, what will I feel, what will I not do, what will I put off for some time, what will I purchase, who will I call on the phone. each of these actions I can decide to do or not do.</p>
			<p>But, in order to decide I need to consider what will be the result, the outcome, the situation that will happen if I decide in a certain way, it depends on my decision that I am free to choose. But before I choose I must be aware of what will be the result of each of my decisions. What will happen because of my decision to see the film, what will happen because of my decision to have some special food, what will be my decision when I realize I have lost a big sum of money?</p>
			<p>So, I can keep in my mind at all times - what will be the good result if I do what I plan to do? what will be the result if I don’t do what I plan to do? Everything I do - be it not speaking, be it speaking -having a meal, or not having a meal - criticizing my friend or not criticizing my friend - shouting at the man who works with me, or not shouting at the man who works with me - remembering a person who has cheated me many years ago, or not remembering the man who stole from me many years ago.</p>
			<p>All of my life I have - and often every minute of my life - I have to be aware of what will be the result of what I do, or say , or speak about, or praise or blame. So, I need to think ahead always and be aware of what will be the result of my speaking, my action, or movements.</p>
			<p>So, before I speak to anyone I need to be aware - is it all alright to say what I am thinking of saying? will I be accepted by people if I say what I want to say. or will I be rejected by people if I say what I might say? What will I gain? What a person always wants to gain from another person is understanding, acceptance, and happiness. There is no life for anyone if there is no acceptance, or understanding or happiness.</p>
			<p>What will make me a happy man, liked and appreciated by others, is my awareness that I will always speak well of other persons -and if I do not want to speak well of another person, then I will remain quiet so that I am not disturbed and other persons will accept me and be happy with me.</p>
			<p>People will always appreciate me if they are aware that I never speak in any bad manner with other people.</p>
			<p>This is very long - I am sorry - and may not be clear as I wanted it to be. But you are always free to question me about it. I will make it more simple the next I write for you.</p>
			<p>Love, Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Being Aware </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">H</span>ere are some of the attitudes and practices that you need to be aware and using if you are wanting to “be sharp” when you are talking with any other person. First and foremost you need to stay very much aware of your feelings and the thoughts and attitudes. If a person is aware of his feelings then he will be very much in control of his thoughts and reactions to what is said to him by another person.</p>
			<p>Remember, I must always be aware of my feelings and thoughts when any person says something to me. I listen to what he says and I pause and reflect or take a moment to think about what the person has said to me. If I do not take the time to listen and understand what the person is saying I will not be able to respond in a manner that will be helpful to me. This is how a person remains smart - they listen to the person, stop and think about what they have said and consider this in their thoughts and then quickly decide how they want to respond to the person.</p>
			<p>I do not just quickly answer back without thinking of my answer. When I stop and think, then I can realize that there are different ways in which I can respond to what has been said to me. If I respond by not being excited but quietly respond in a good manner then the person speaking to me will be more satisfied and will speak to me in a friendly way. I can respond in a cool, quiet manner even though the other has not spoken in a quiet manner. If I keep my quiet manner then I am being smart and the other person will listen to what I have to say.</p>
			<p>My relations with other persons depend on my ability to remain settled and peaceful, no matter what is said to me or whatever the other person may say.</p>
			<p>I hope that this is helpful to you. It is necessary for a person to be always calm and open to listen to the other person - then the other person will respect me and then be open to listen to me and agree with me.</p>
			<p>All the best to you - Dad</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">F</span>irst I apologize for not sending this to you before now - I remain always very busy here these days. Anyway I will write what I can and then can add more later on.</p>
			<p>Young girls are usually quite withdrawn and do not speak out quickly or strongly - they seem to be hesitant - so you have to be quite cautious in how you first speak with them. Keep a sort of quiet tone and be sure you follow what she says and try to understand her feelings from the manner in which she speaks and the sort of firmness or non firmness in the manner in which she speaks. She will want you to be reassuring to her - especially as she does not know you and is not fully at ease with you, someone who she doesn’t know too well. If she begins to ask questions about yourself then you may believe that she is interested in you, wants to know more about you and so you can be ready to tell her quietly about yourself and if she continues to ask questions about yourself then you can believe that she is somewhat interested in you and wants to know more about you. Note the strength of her speech - whether it is firm or just light. Notice if she seems relaxed in her face, smiling maybe, bright in the way she looks. How long does she pause between sentences and words? If she keeps asking small questions feel good and answer her with confidence that she really is interested in finding out about you. If you ask her questions, do it quietly with light words, not strong, being very supportive of her, very acceptant - in a way you can repeat to her whatever she says to you by saying it in a quiet supportive manner. If she asks questions of you she is probably interested in you so answer her in a way that she will keep asking questions about you.</p>
			<p>I will send something else later in the day. All the best – Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Being aware of people </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> first apologize that I have not written to you as I said I would. I have been very busy today - I had to spend time with two husband and wife teams who came at different times seeking admission for their son and daughter.</p>
			<p>Now, let me tell you about the manner of deciding how you believe the meeting between you and some woman whom you are wanting to perhaps be friends with or even marry. First of all notice whether the girl is showing some sort of interest, like being a little nervous, and maybe a little hesitant to talk with you. You may sense that they are very careful about how they are going to talk with you. “Hesitant” means that they seem to take some time to consider what they are going to say, they may not be speaking quickly or smoothly because they are careful about, how they want you to understand them. If they speak too freely they may be afraid of giving you a wrong impression about themselves.</p>
			<p>Both you and the girl will want to make a good impression on each other since you do not know each other fully. So, you need to be cool, slowly being in control of your voice, of your gestures, of the way you speak.</p>
			<p>If you can be relaxed in the manner in which you stand and talk, or sit and talk, then she also will tend to be relaxed if she is at ease. So, you can use that as a sign - if she talks easily, always quietly waiting for your answer. You can judge how relaxed she is by her voice and how much she looks at you openly.

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span> his evening I was thinking of the feelings that may come up into my awareness when I am walking along the street. I may be enjoying walking quietly along the sidewalk. It may be crowded and I am bothered by the number of people going along with me. Since it is so crowded I may realize that I am not feeling at ease as I have to shift around the many people on the sidewalk with me.</p>
			<p>And some people are going very fast and bumping into me and this disturbs me. But I cannot do anything about it so I just carry on walking as I can - I step aside as I can so I carry on as I can. I just have to accept my feelings and so go on. The main thing is -I know the feelings I have and know I cannot make a change because of the people going along.</p>
			<p>So, there are many times when I have to keep aware of the feelings I have and know that it is all right. I decide not to be upset at the situation. This I do many times in my life when I decide that I cannot bring about any change in the situation I am in so I accept and keep going along as I can.</p>
			<p>So, I can be aware at times of the feelings I have and yet cannot bring about a change in the situation - so I do not become upset or bothered.</p>
			<p>All the best - Hank</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>his follows from our telephone conversation this morning. Always in life each person has to define himself, that is, each person has an experience of his or her self. This experience we are more or less aware of some people are very aware and remember all that has happened to them earlier in their life. Some of them have had a good experience in being and becoming ourselves and so will feel strong and capable of judging whatever comes to them in their living their lives. Other people have not been so lucky and have had to face very difficult situations and problems, sometimes acceptance, sometimes non-acceptance from others.</p>
			<p>If everything was perfect each person would be able to understand all that is taking place in their interactions with other people - and would have had very supportive interactions with others. But life in this world is not perfect. We have to live with negative reactions from other people, we have to realize that sometimes we are facing rejection from other persons. In a way life as it comes to us is very much not in our control. In some manner we have to face living situations which present us with some negativity that we cannot avoid. And then we feel we have no way of avoiding the negativity that is around us.</p>
			<p>Then we tend to feel down, we are discouraged, not knowing how to get anything positive in the present situation. We do not know all the causes which affect our lives. We may think we are in control of them when this is not really so. The people we work with may ignore us, may not speak with us in a friendly manner. We are not free to change how people speak and act with us.</p>
			<p>So, we have to discover within our self the freedom to think and feel as we want to think and feel. We remain the master of our inner world - of our own thoughts and feelings. So I choose to think as I can, giving positive strokes to my self, not allowing the negativity that is from other people to upset me. I appreciate myself. I have the right to feel good for myself - so to feel good no matter what is on the outside around me. I am in charge of me.</p>
			<p>Let me know what you think about this. Dad</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">P</span>lease excuse my delay in sending this to you. As usual, I have been very busy today. I will give you something on relationship, for the benefits in our life mainly come from our relationships with other people, and also many times persons find that their anger comes from their relationships, although it would seem difficult to believe that there can be problems when members of the same family have great difficulties in forming or expressing the relationships that should be the backbone or strength of the family. But there is something important to note here - that if the relationships between members of the same family do not seem to work out it can result in a much more difficult situation (more angry situations and animosities between the members of the family). This can be when some relatives, aunts or uncles, of cousins - seem to be very distant and accepting of the other members of the family. At times those who we think should be closest and most understanding seem to become the most difficult persons to accept.</p>
			<p>First all of us need to have relationships - we cannot live alone and in the situation in which we live together in a family we have an in built tendency and need to be together and be supportive to each other. This support comes from very deep within us and is necessary for us to feel at ease, for the sharing together in the family, even the physical sharing brings into the realization that we are not alone and need the help and support of the others in the family. And when the family relations are smooth and helpful, then we will feel strong to be the persons we are. We feel comfort being who we are with the others in the family, normally we would seek to help each other.</p>
			<p>Then there are the relationships we form with persons not within our family - these can often be stronger than our relations in the family.</p>
			<p>I’ll write more about this in another email. All the best to you - love, <strong>Fr. Hank </strong></p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: How do I face negative situations with people ? </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, relationships are important for us in our lives. Relationships make life worth living for all of us, for it is when we have a relationship with another person that we feel well - we have feelings of well-being. It is by our realizing that we have a relationship with someone whom we feel happy with and content with, that we get the feeling of wellness. Being open with another person - trusting that the other person feels at ease with me and is content to be with me and talk with me - this enables me to experience that they want to feel close to us, or that they are relaxed and feeling positive with me. Then this gives a quiet, strong sense of our self - that we are wanted and can experience the positive qualities that give us relaxation and meaning. Then I find that I have something that I want to share with the other person - I find I am relaxed and moved from within myself to talk with him or her - I get some sense from them that I am accepted by them. This gives me confidence to continue my relationship with them. Through our conversation I often find that there are feelings that we can easily share in our talk.</p>
			<p>The different moods that we go through during the day spring from our relations with the different people. If I feel relaxed and at ease with a person I will want to continue with that person. If I find that person not talkative and withdrawn or talking in a negative manner then I decide to stay away from that person - I will not be happy in their company. We do need to feel at ease - then we will feel strong and able to discuss with the other person. If the discussions goes well I will feel stronger within myself , more ready to enjoy my life. After all - my happiness does come from the relationships that I have with people.</p>
			<p>Relationships are like emotional vitamins that give me the strength to go through the difficulties that come up as I live my life and go through the interactions that I have with other persons. Basically it is best for me to live my life by being open and hoping that the other persons will be positive to me - and if they are not open or speak roughly or sharply to me and so seem closed off to me then I will not want to continue to be with them.</p>
			<p>Many people go through their interactions with others with no interest in making a connection with the other person - these are the people we call “loners” - they are just not interested in sharing and being with others - they seem happy to live alone, being by themselves practically all the time.</p>
			<p>It is very difficult when we realize that the other person is in some way being critical or judging of me, not open - then I just have to move on from that person - being with them will not cause me to feel more at ease and happy to be me. If we do have a person or persons who causes me to feel welcome and at ease then I need to recognize that person and reach out to them in friendship. Friendships are made as I become positive with another person and wish to spend more time with them - I become interested in them. You can make new relationships as you appreciate that the other person seems to be freely accepting you.</p>
			<p>Good success in your relationships - Love - Dad</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: How do I face negative situation with people ? </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">L</span>ook at the question which you asked me before the last email I sent to you - your question reads like this - how do I face negative situations with people?</p>
			<p>If I sense that the situation is negative towards me, then I have to decide what is the cause of this negativity and what can I do to get through to the other person or people in the situation. Is it possible for me to make a change in the cause of the negativity? What can I do to break through the negativity? Which persons - or which one or two people - can I begin to speak to in such a manner that I can speak to them in a smooth and friendly manner?</p>
			<p>Remember that anywhere - in an office or in a meeting place with other people - it is up to me to break through in the talk with others - to make contact and speak with others. I cannot expect the other person to come forth and speak with me - I have to begin conversations - I have to want to interact with the other persons. And in order to do that I need to believe that I will always feel happier when I have made positive contact with another person and all of us do need positive contact with one or two or a few other persons - then we do feel happier and at ease. As I make contact with other people I feel more at ease and more alive. Remember “no man is an island” - he has to be with other persons.</p>
			<p>I was talking with the kids in the community the other night about this. The help that they receive and will gain here in ASV is called by the experts “psychosocial rehabilitation”. Those are the words used in the four days that I and Anando and Usha attended in NIMHANS last month. The experts - from many countries in the world - placed very much emphasis on the word “social” which means being with people. If social means being with people then it is necessary to have very good skills in talking with people, and mixing with them, feeling at ease with them, able to share, talk with them, feel at ease with them.</p>
			<p>When I am able to have a conversation with people - and become friendly with them - then I have a skill which will enable me to be at ease with people, enjoy their company, find it easy to respect them, and feel that I have a place with people - I make myself open to people, have a place with people. But, I have to be open and make the effort - it is I - I’m the one who has to make a place for myself with others - I myself who has to make the effort and speak with others - enjoy being with others. Enjoy being with others - that is the goal of life.</p>
			<p>Love, Dad</p>
			<p>Tomorrow we are having a long staff meeting just on this topic for it is very important.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Being Strong </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>ll of our reactions to any contact with another person or thinking about another person or situation can be taken care of in a satisfactory manner for us as long as we are aware of what we are doing with our energy.</p>
			<p>So, our energy is the special operative word, for first of all we are using our energy whether we are feeling, thinking or believing in whichever manner we are reacting or expressing ourselves to the other person. We express our energy according to the need of acting. The need depends on the action we have to take in our life at the present moment.</p>
			<p>Can you be aware of the energy you are feeling at any time? What is this energy leading you to think and tend to do?</p>
			<p>I am sorry I have to leave it right now - I have had a bad day for visitors - one visit by 4 psychiatrists.</p>
			<p>Soma’s father just died this afternoon and they were trying to get in touch with her - they did and she phoned me - she was in Pune.</p>

			<p class="text-center"><strong>Sub: Ego states </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>e used the “ego states” to refer to the three different energy awareness that we can have with ourselves at any time. One is the Child ego state which is concerned with my feelings - fear , anger, happiness, sadness. The Child ego refers to when I am having my attention and awareness mainly in my feelings, be they happy or negative feelings.</p>
			<p>Then there is a Adult ego state when I am mainly occupied with the thoughts, attitudes and direction that I am giving to my consciousness.</p>
			<p>The third ego state is the Parent ego state which refers to the times when I am coming from the directives I give myself, or the principles that I use in guiding my thoughts and expressions.</p>
			<p>At all times in my active conscious life my consciousness will be directed through one of these three ego states. One of the reactions in one or other of the states will be the one which causes me to speak, behave or act in a certain manner. As for example - when a person is laughing - we can say the person is in their child ego states -the same if they are sad or weeping. Or if the person is wanting to buy something and is calculating how much the item will cost he will be in his adult ego state. When I am deciding what is going to give me happiness during the day I will be putting my energy in the Parent ego state. When I am pointing out their faults to another person then I will be usually in the Parent ego state. In order to shift our energy we have to be aware of whether we are occupied with feelings or with thinking, or with self-directing.</p>
			<p>What I have to pay attention to is to see whether I am examining my feelings, or paying attention to my thinking, or remembering the best way to speak or explain how I am directing myself at the present moment - like asking when buying something - “Is this too expensive or not?” - and other questions like that.</p>
			<p>What is necessary is to keep aware of the variable thoughts and thought patterns coming up in my consciousness - are these patterns helping me to relate to the people and business going on around me? or do I have to stop and examine the reasons why I am feeling like I am at the present moment...All of this will help me to keep in charge of myself and make myself understood to other people.</p>
			<p>And so I must always be reflective - able to feel at ease with myself at any time - not bogged down by heavy negative feelings or not keeping negativity or animosity towards other people.</p>
			<p>We can discuss all of this as we go. Love, Dad</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">S</span>orry for my delay in writing to you - I keep you in mind, have been thinking of you but these past weeks I have been more than busy. What I believe that you are desiring to improve is your ability to meet and interact with people. This is some thing that can be difficult for everybody as other people are they are - they do not fit into the ways and manners that we would wish to have with us. It seems that we often have to try and fit in with the other person even when it is difficult for us.</p>
			<p>So I need to be strong within myself and fully conscious of myself and what I am feeling - I must at least be open in some manner because I wish to be able to “get along” with the other person, which means I want to be able to come to some understanding and mutual respect with the other person. So it is best to begin with an “open mind” as they call it. I am in a way noncommittal, which means that I have not made up my opinion whether I will be easily acceptant of this person or willing to be friendly or open with them. I am in a way cautious, yet in some manner open, expectant as to how this person will be with me. It is best to be open and acceptant of the other person until I come to know them better. I will stay reserved within myself and in my talk and conservation as I experience how they are speaking and what feelings may be coming to me because of the words or manner in which they are talking. I remain reserved within myself, and my talk will be fairly quiet and wondering how the other will be speaking or thinking of me. Within myself I remain strong and reserved, yet within myself making the assessment of the other’s talk and the manner in which they are with me. I do not make a judgment on them until I seem fairly certain that now I have a good understanding about the other person.</p>
			<p>I hope that this gives you some direction to take with others when you have to deal or talk with them. It is often not easy to measure how the other will be with you, so it is necessary to be patient in the beginning and wait till you can make a judgment about them.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">P</span>lease realize that the problem which has been solved this morning could have been solved two days ago if both you and your uncle had been able to remain calm and listening and considering what each person wanted to say. To give into feelings of anger will never solve a problem but just make everything more upset and then no helpful conclusion will come about.</p>
			<p>I support both of you to understand and be able to trust each other. That is the ideal that helps all people to live helpfully with each other - the trust that must exist between each other. And the only tool that enables persons to trust is simply trust as each makes a sincere effort to remain open and accepting of the other’s viewpoint.</p>

			<p>Dear Sundar,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>here are all sorts of people whom we live, meet, talk with, learn about, have a pleasant time with, some we are close to, some who seem to understand us and want to be with us more, some who may want to give us information, some who will listen to us and understand, others who listen but do not seem to understand us and some do answer, respond when they have said that they will respond, some people will be interested in us and we can believe that they really want to be close to us, others may seem to say they want to be close to us but who not seem to understand us.</p>
			<p>So, there are all sorts of people, persons with interests like us, others who are not interested in what we are interested in, some seem to understand us, others do not understand us yet seem to try to direct us.</p>
			<p>We have to realize that we cannot really understand many of the people whom we meet, even many who are our relatives and of our extended family tree. It is good when we feel understood by some people, but will not feel good when they do not seem to understand us. So, we have to realize that we cannot expect to understand all people, even our relations, aunts or uncles, or cousins, each person is living his own life and having his own ideas and thoughts and desires, and directives. So, we need to be open and realize and careful and be aware that some people will not accept me even though they might seem to be with me in understanding and friendship in the beginning.</p>
			<p>So, at times I have to move on - not be upset by the reaction that some people show to me - not answering, not paying attention to me, or anything like that. I just have to accept how they are and move on - not become upset or angry with them. They have their own world so let them be in their own world. I need to keep my friends, for I must have some friends with whom I can share my life with some few people.</p>

			<p><strong>February 3, 2012 </strong></p>
			<p>Dear Dad,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">H</span>ow are you. I am fine. I am writing this letter to share my experience in ASV.</p>
			<p>I joined there on 19th October 1993, before which I had 3 spells of psychosis.</p>
			<p>I entered ASV where I came to know about the diagnosis and features of my disease slowly. Ms. Mennal. was my buddy with whom I was to share and talk every day a few minutes.</p>
			<p>The structure and discipline in ASV was new and difficult for me in the beginning. Later on the same was very useful for me.</p>
			<p>Slowly, I came in touch with feelings and was able to recollect my bitter past experience. Group therapy, feelings check, positive stroke, yogic therapy, meditation were all very useful.</p>
			<p>Slowly, I started extending my relationship with Donna, Dielta, Dale and Fr. Hank. Having relationship was very difficult for me initially. But slowly I started trusting these people and developed good relationship with Fr. Hank (Dad), Dielta.</p>
			<p>Luckily, I had good peers with me. Leena, Cecy and Manisha were good friends as well.</p>
			<p>I learnt the following things –</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>(1)</dt>
				<dd> Being in touch with emotions </dd>
				<dt>(2)</dt>
				<dd> How to handle them appropriately </dd>
				<dt>(3)</dt>
				<dd> Relationships are good and are important in life </dd>
				<dt>(4) </dt>
				<dd>Trusting people who are close to me </dd>
				<dt>(5)</dt>
				<dd> Anger is a feeling which I used to express in a dangerous way. I started doing anger program. </dd>
				<dt>(6) </dt>
				<dd>I started to work on self esteem, by which I gained confidence. </dd>
				<dt>(7) </dt>
				<dd>I implemented the habit of giving positive stroke to myself. </dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In Athma Shakti, there was a beautiful therapy called anger therapy which was very useful for me. By this program I could make a drastic change in the relationship with my natural father. Before coming to ASV, I used to hate my father but now I have a good relationship. Thanks to Fr. Hank (contract Dad). Not only the feelings that I worked on, I also concentrated to work on my thoughts for which Dielta was very helpful. Most of the time I had negative thoughts and my presentation also would be negative. Because of this work, I slowly started looking at my daily life positively. Everyday, I say “Today is a good day and the most precious day for me”. So life turned out to be positive.</p>
			<p>In 1997, I joined M.S. (Anatomy) in St. John’s Medical College, Bangalore. This was again a gift for me from God. Because during my higher studies, I had an opportunity to visit ASV in the weekends.</p>
			<p>During this time, I would have therapy with Dad regularly. So, I would say God is great in all His ways.</p>
			<p>I was even feeling proud in front of new kids because I was an ex-kid who got fully well and doing higher studies. God has blessed me by giving this golden opportunity of three years.</p>
			<p>When I was in ASV in 1995, Ali, a kid from Australia gave me the responsibility of cleaning Dad’s room and taking care of his laundry. This I felt as a big boon because this big job will be given only to responsible kids.</p>
			<p>After completion of my PG degree, I joined at Jipmer where I continued the practice of writing my feelings check. And whenever I was very angry, I would do the anger program. In Jipmer, I continued meditation, swimming. I kept myself busy by going to driving class, music class etc.</p>
			<p>Whatever I learnt in ASV, I am using in my daily life for my students, because we meet students suffering from depression, anxiety etc. and I am able to do counseling from the therapy which I have undergone in ASV.</p>
			<p>Counseling is something which has become important for most of the students because the level of stress is high. With lots of love,</p>

			<p>Dear Dad,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am happy to write to you. Dad, I am doing fine. I have got many lectures this month. So, quite busy. I have occupied myself in the evenings by going for long walks.</p>
			<p>I discovered a swimming pool where my hostelmates go for swimming. I am also going for the swimming on Sundays with one girl. I have got one friend in the hostel to whom I am moving closer slowly. (I am scared to move fast and have a break) I like her. She is doing M.D. in pharmacology. Once in a while we both go for outing, beach etc., Dad, I have started driving lessons. Today was my 3rd class. On the whole I am content with myself, watching out that I don’t over do. Dad, once in a while when I am depressed I write feelings check. Do fantasy work with you. I am very happy that I had an opportunity to meet you in my life. Dad, I remember you in my prayers. How is ASV?</p>
			<p>Dad one sad news. Tomorrow is my graduation day. I am not able to go because of some reasons. It is in St. John’s campus. My back is not that healthy to make two consecutive night bus journey. Last year I used to dream that when I come to stage entire student’s crowd will be clapping hands (because my students like me) . Always my dreams never come true (little exaggeration)</p>
			<p>Dad, I am happy in the department. I appreciate myself for the changes I have made.</p>
			<p>Dad, I will come to ASV to see you in the month of April or May.</p>
			<p>Convey my regards to all kids and staff.</p>
			<p>Remember me in your prayers.</p>

			<p>Dear Dad,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">H</span>ow are you? I am able to sit and write to you in my busy schedule. Dad, your granddaughter Hema, my parents and myself are fine.</p>
			<p>My husband had come home during Easter and he spent four days with us. He enjoyed very much our daughter’s company. My husband is a very nice man, lovable person. One thing which I can’t agree is that he is spending a lot of money for his relatives. On this point, we both get into clashes quite often. Otherwise I thank God for giving me a nice life partner. My daughter recognizes me now. Feeding her is a problem because she is a fussy eater.</p>
			<p>Dad, if I start writing about her, I will not end now.</p>
			<p>My mother is getting old and she is still in the sorrow of her children's' loss. She gets irritated with me very often. Dad, I get easily angry with my mother these days. I am working on that to bring it down.</p>
			<p>Dad, how is your health? Convey my regards to each and every one in ASV (all kids especially). Dad, you are the person whom God has given as a gift for me. Every minute I shall thank God for that.</p>
			<p>Dad, how was Easter Sunday?</p>
			<p>I will be joining on my work on June 2nd . Pray for me and bless me that my family life be peaceful and joyful.</p>

			<p>Dear Mangala,</p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">M</span>any thanks for your letter. I apologize for not replying immediately. Yes, please come.</p>
			<p>I am in good health – my doctor has told me that he is satisfied about how I am doing. I do not have any aches or pains. I have to be more regular in my morning walks though. I still do the regular yoga exercises as always with the kids. The community goes well enough, there is a good spirit. We have been able to complete the building as planned but there are still some bills we have to cover. Many houses have come up around us. I took a good time in September to be off on retreat, something that gave me much new strength in my spiritual awareness of myself. It gives me great comfort and consolation to know that I am fulfilling the will of the Father, our Father, in my endeavour to make this life a more meaningful and happier life for others. I keep to my meditation time in the morning. This carries me along and gives a deep undercurrent to my daily immersion in the therapy and care for others.</p>
			<p>I would very much enjoy meeting and talking with you. If it is at all possible come for a short time with all the family or come by yourself for a shorter time if that is possible. We have Meeta’s house where guests can stay for some time but it is not free all the time, as depends on who may be coming and when. But I would like to speak with you.</p>
			<p>I have more contact with parents lately. I have had a day with them in June, July and September and a special one in October. My attempt is to give the parents some idea of the therapy that we are practicing here so that they may be more helpful to the kids when they return home or go for visits at home. Remember in the old days we did not have any strong contact with the families. I find though the parents have great difficulty in understanding the personality of their son or daughter and cannot really have the patience or the time to reflect on what really has been the problem that has caused the young person to develop the personality problem that has been created without anyone’s wish or desire. The parents want the person to return very soon to what they call the “main stream” something that interprets as wanting the person to be working and earning a living. They want this without realizing the tremendous adjustments in personality, in attitudes and beliefs about self and others, in learning to deal with negative feelings and reactions that often still arise in some situations, in being clear and stable and open in their thinking.</p>
			<p>The young person has to do so much reflection and come to a deep and serious self-knowledge in order to function in an active and demanding life that is the present ever evolving social world. Young people can become well and can move out to a new life. I do believe it is well worth the effort to bring persons to a new experience of themselves. And this I will always carry on accomplishing.</p>
			<p>Again thanks for writing. Believe you are always in my heart and mind, as I pray to Christ to give you his Spirit to strengthen and to guide you<strong>. </strong></p>
			<p><strong>Love, Dad </strong></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Fr. George</h2>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>n this letter I am fulfilling my duty that which I need to carry out. I need to speak to you about the death of one of our kids, a person who had lived and found a new life because of his coming to Athma Shakti. He was here for about two and half years growing within himself. He committed himself to changing his life, his future.</p>
			<p>The person I am trying to describe was one who marvelously was able to find a whole new future for himself. He was very close to me and happy to address me as “Dad”. I am speaking about Fr. George. One day he had phoned me – this was when we were in the first building we had. George had phoned me from Delhi and asked me if he could come and spend time with me because he wished to develop and bring more life into his person. I agreed immediately and told George to come down from his studies in the Christian scriptures in Delhi. At that time George was fairly lost within himself and having troubles with his studies. He flew down and the way he was hesitant gave me some indication of the problems he was having. It was a beautiful day with the sun and open sky, hot at the time George came, with a huge heavy coat and a hat on his head. Immediately I recognized that yes, he was having trouble trying to figure out how he could adapt himself to the world. He was a person who worried about everything. I could see that this was his basic problem and I welcomed him profusely.</p>
			<p>George gave me a bit of a problem. Here was a man who was a serious scripture scholar who seemed lost and looking for some guidance and help. He just was not functioning clearly and well. He was worrying too much and was always overly careful about whatever thoughts were being put forth. It was alright to be a careful scripture scholar but worrying was no way to handle the various difficulties.</p>
			<p>I admired the openness and freedom of George as he settled in with the other 18 young patients whom we were looking after in Athma Shakti at that time. We had young people from Australia to United States, all young men and women full of life and energy, very open and lively. George settled down very much with the group who crowded together in some small rooms we had then. George did all that he could to fit in and adapt with these people who were younger than him and certainly had different interests and conversations that George would never have had. George became very close to me and called me his father. He referred to me always as his father. I guess the average age of the kids was between 18 to</p>
			<p>20. George who had spent years in training as a priest in Christian scriptures, set aside his scripture studies and, concentrated on developing his personality and in time, he became a great friend of all other persons in the community. George gave his full time to developing his abilities to understand psychology and the practice that would enable him to function successfully as a catholic priest and scripture scholar.</p>
			<p>He was able to return and be a professor of scripture at the Jesuit house in Delhi. He was a very good scripture scholar, enjoyed what he was doing and he was appreciated very much by the people who lived with him. His writings and his classes were very much respected. He was also a very popular member of the community. He always was friendly and active among his fellow teachers and students.</p>
			<p>But, this was all to end when George had a slight accident when driving which caused his death. It seems he didn’t realize what happened in that small accident, and in a few days he found that something was wrong in his head. He seemingly developed a few blood clots in his brain because of the accident. This was the cause of his death. In the last years of his life he had had to spend some time every year for special studies on how his brain was functioning.</p>
			<p>Allow me to quote a paragraph that he wrote in his writing on the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
			<p>“The Sermon on the Mount(SM) the first and the most important of the five discourses of Jesus in Mathew’s Gospel, presents his radical , moral teaching in a systematic fashion. It has fascinated the world, fired the imagination of great minds like Tolstoy and Gandhiji. The later has confessed that it “went straight to his heart and was along with the Gita one of the two influences that shaped his moral-political thought. Many people across the world also consider it as the essence of Christianity”.</p>
			<p>I shall always be filled with appreciation and thanksgiving for having known Fr.George. I can say that he was one of the beautiful personalities that I have experienced in the years I have been involved here in Athma Shakti. I myself learnt from him. He was so very serious in his studies and so willing to donate his time and knowledge in helping other people.</p>
			<p>I believe that he was certainly one of the most generous and helpful of the people whom I have been fortunate enough to experience and appreciate in the many years I have been involved in helping people.</p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Letter From Fr. George </strong></p>
			<p><span class="big-letter">I</span> am happy to testify that I was a member of the Athma Shakti Vidyalaya therapeutic community about 17 years ago. I had a nervous breakdown when I was 37 years old and was teaching as a college lecturer. I had serious problems and I received help from this community to resolve these problems for which I have spent 5 years there undergoing its excellent method of treatment. The community’s approach which emphasizes working on one’s problems and getting one’s therapeutic needs met as part of a family-like community rather than on medication was very appealing to me. Although it is slow and takes time it has enabled me to resolve my problems in depth and to get fully well. After the period of treatment I resumed my work as a lecturer and after a few years started also on my doctoral studies. I have since finished my doctorate in a prestigious European University. I am happy to add that I also received the highest academic grade in this University for my doctorate and my doctoral dissertation has been published in a renowned international scientific series in my field. I am now fully back in my work teaching both at the graduate and post - graduate levels and occasionally contributing in scholarly journals in my specialization. All this involves great progress and would not have been possible without the timely and competent help I received at Athma Shakti Vidyalaya. It is a project that needs to be generously helped and supported. In fact it is a pity that there are not enough such competent institutions in this country although the need is so great.</p>
