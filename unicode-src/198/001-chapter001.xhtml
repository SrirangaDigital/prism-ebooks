		<p>A management Guru visits a site where some people were breaking stones at the foot of a rocky hillock. He asks one stone-breaker, “What are you doing?” The man angrily retorts, “Can’t you see? I am breaking stones!” He apologizes and goes to another stone-breaker and repeats the same question. This man’s passionate reply was astonishing. He says, “I am building a beautiful temple!” The management Guru purposely asks, “But I don’t see any temple here. I can only see that you and the others are busy breaking the stones.” “No,” insists this stone-breaker, “I am not simply breaking stones. Though I am breaking stones, I know that these stones are being transported to the site where a magnificent temple is being built. These stones are used in building the beautiful temple.” He pauses and asks, “Am I not building the temple?” The management Guru nods his head in confirmation.</p>
		<p>The first stone-breaker had a myopic approach; the second one had developed a holistic approach and therefore, could see the bigger picture. In the Corporate World, we find that many managers and bosses are breaking rocks rather than building a temple. Stone-age bosses are myopic in approach. They only break the rocks without seeing the bigger picture through a holistic approach.</p>
		<p>During my over three decades of experience in Corporate India, I have worked with many ‘Stone-age’ bosses.</p>
		<p>It is not that easy to get along with Stone-age bosses. They are difficult people. Most of them reach the position of envy not by growing but by swelling. They do not grow; they simply swell.</p>
		<p>Swelling is not growth; swelling is the symptom of a disease. Since they do not update their knowledge and skills, and never try to mend their attitude, they lose the competency required for the position they occupy. These are the guys who superannuate before attaining the real age of superannuation.</p>
		<p>Stone-age bosses suffer from many inner deficiencies. One such deficiency is their lack of knowledge and limited vocabulary. Once I was travelling by train with my cricket team to participate in the Inter-Unit Sports Meet hosted by BHEL Bhopal. It was a 2tier AC Coach. I was representing the BHEL (R&#38;D), Hyderabad Cricket team, as the non-playing manager. Our young players were mostly engineers and scientists – very cultured and sober people. At night I woke up on hearing the noise of shouting and quarrelling. Being the team manager, I had to take care of my team players. I got up and rushed to the berths where the quarrel was taking place.</p>
		<p>I found that one of my engineers, R Krishnan, was having a heated argument with a politician – an MP. (Later I came to know he was Venkat Swami, a popular political leader in those days). On enquiring as to what was the cause of the dispute, Krishnan told me, pointing his finger towards the leader, “This fellow called me, ‘You bloody fool!’.” Then he narrated the full story. It appears that the MP along with his party-man boarded the train at the last station. He was allotted the upper berth but he wanted to occupy the lower berth. Instead of making a request, he ordered Krishnan to vacate the lower berth on which he was sleeping and go to the upper berth. Since his attitude was very rude, Krishnan refused to oblige him. This annoyed Venkat Swami who shouted at Krishnan using the words, “You bloody fool!” This remark sparked the situation out of control and other team players also joined Krishnan and gave the leader a mouthful of angry words.</p>
		<p>By the time I intervened, the khadi-clothed leader had become sober. Perhaps he had understood that he was barking up the wrong tree or rather had caught a Tartar! He never thought that the young man and his team players would pay him back with more harsh words. Gradually tempers cooled down with the interference of the leader’s companion, who seemed to be a mature and well-educated person. Krishnan, as a good gesture, offered his lower berth to the leader and went to the upper berth.</p>
		<p>Later, the leader’s companion talked to me in a low tone. “Sir, your young man became upset for nothing. What your engineer didn’t realize was that my MP <em>gaaru</em> doesn’t know English. Your engineer went on arguing with him in English. My MP also wanted to respond to him in English. He uttered what he knew. Believe me, Sir! He doesn’t know English except for these three words ‘You Bloody Fool!’.” I could not control my laughter and he joined me wholeheartedly, looking at the berth where his ‘Stone-age’ boss was sleeping, whistling out loud snores!</p>
		<p>Stone-age bosses know their deficiencies well but will not openly admit it. But there are some Stone-age bosses who are ignorant of their obsolescence. What they had learnt eons ago they consider still relevant in the new age. They remain ignorant of their ignorance. The problem is not their ignorance; the problem is the ignorance of their ignorance. Such bosses, who are not even aware of their obsolescence, are irreversible. They take pride in sharing their obsolescence with people without any sense of professional guilt. There is no feeling of guilt because they never realize that their rusted knowledge does not make any sense in this new age.</p>
		<p>Some bosses possess sound technical knowledge yet remain weak in some other areas because they have never attempted to widen the scope of their knowledge.</p>
		<p>One such boss that comes to my mind is SS Jain (not his real name). He was my colleague in National Hydro-electric Power Corporation (NHPC). In 1970, I was posted in Baira Siul Hydroelectric Project near Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. SS Jain was an Executive Engineer who was a technical expert with one weakness</p>
		<p>– lack of proficiency in speaking English. His personal secretary was quite good in English. He knew his boss’s weakness. So, whenever he wanted to get some favour from his boss, he used to go to him and ask him to give him some dictation. This was his boss’s weak point. Even if he was angry on some issue he would calm down when someone touched his weak point. Many times he would say, “I gave dictation yesterday, didn’t I?” His secretary would then remind him that it was not yesterday but a month back when he gave the dictation by reading out from the written text. This would make the boss very nervous. He would virtually beseech his secretary to give him a day’s time; he would surely dictate a few letters tomorrow! Seeing the iron hot, the secretary would coolly ask some favour from him with an implicit understanding that he would not insist on dictation anymore. This way he used to blackmail his boss quite innovatively and get many favours from him. SS Jain would prefer to give him a couple of days off ‘unofficially’ as an implicit bargain – <em>better you be away and enjoy yourself but do not trouble me. </em></p>
		<p>Unlike SS Jain, some Stone-age bosses are blind to their ignorance. They do not want to learn for they are complacent, over-confident and have out-grown the heights of incompetence. If attempts are made to educate them, they mistake their <em>well wishers </em>to be their <em>bête noire</em>.</p>
		<p>There is another species of Stone-age bosses who are known as ‘fence sitters’. A fence-sitter boss is a special species of the Stone-age boss. Peter Block, the author of the famous book ‘The <span>Empowered Manager’, describes the fence-sitter boss as someone who will simply not take a stand <em>for</em> or <em>against</em>. In most of the cases it is observed that at the end of the meeting conducted by a fence-sitter boss, we are never quite sure whether a decision has been made or not! Sometimes at such meetings, the need for clarity of objectives and goals is discussed with so much ambiguity that everything seems to be clear when the discussion is on but as soon as we walk out of the room this clarity evaporates. </span></p>
		<p>The Stone-age boss, who is in the habit of sitting on the fence, forgets the cardinal principle of decision-making – <em>it is too dangerous to be over cautious in decision making</em>. “To be cautious and noncommittal is an easy state of mind. The fence-sitter boss is the bureaucratic proto-type. To the bureaucratic mind, danger is in the foreground and opportunity is in the background,” observes Peter Block in his book ‘The Empowered Manager’.</p>
		<p>A Stone-age boss is definitely a disaster hunter. A disaster hunter is an addictive personality with shades of workaholism. “Deep down, he doesn’t mind the prospect of his eventual demise. Part of him, in fact, is going about the task of actively creating that final solution, hunting his own disaster with all the energy that his madness imparts,” believes Stanley Bing. And PJO Rourke affixes the final seal for recognizing these species of patriarchy by saying, “There is one thing to say about crazy bosses. It’s horribly, terribly, sadly, thoroughly, hopelessly, gruesomely true.”</p>
		<p>It is not very difficult to recognize the Stone-age bosses. They have some specific <em>likes</em> and <em>dislikes</em> and also exhibit certain typical characteristics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Hierarchy</em> is their first love. They strongly believe and religiously follow the practice of ‘Through Proper Channel’. They are upset if someone deviates from the principle of hierarchy. If the choice exists between ‘Through Proper Channel’ and ‘Urgency’, they will say, “Urgency is understandable, but management principles cannot be butchered for the sake of whims and fancies – let things move only ‘through the proper channel’!”<br />Following the defined rules and regulations is considered the purpose of their existence. If there is a choice between ‘to follow the procedure’ scrupulously or ‘to meet the company’s objectives and business goals’, they will follow the former without any feeling of ‘professional guilt’.</li>
			<li>Their leadership style creates an ‘anti-empowerment’ environment (patriarchal environment). They not only believe in but also consciously work for ‘Patriarchal’ values and strong ‘controls’ to enjoy power. </li>
			<li>They believe in controls and confines. Flexibility, fluidity and the desired ambiguity are grossly mistaken by them as management lapses and therefore, they control these under the garb of strict rules and regulations. This way they make their presence felt by ‘breaking stones’ and displaying their Stone-age managerial skills. </li>
			<li>Their only wisdom is ‘conventional wisdom’. </li>
			<li>They prefer ‘routine’ to ‘creativity’ – following the beaten track is their normal path. </li>
			<li>They look for loyalties in the guise of searching for competency amongst their people. </li>
			<li>Stone-age bosses strongly believe in ‘uni-functionalism’. They are loyal to the discipline they belong to. They strongly believe in ‘territories’ and therefore, create ‘watertight compartments’ and ‘discipline silos’ in the organization. </li>
			<li>Cost-cutting in distress – ‘chop, chop, chopping’ is considered the only medicine for all corporate diseases. </li>
			<li>They see a business as a huge machine; made up of departments and disciplines with employees as ‘cogs’ to produce the product. They are unkind to emotions, commitments and involvement of employees and therefore, fail to assess the losses caused by the withdrawal of the ‘shares of commitment’ by the dissatisfied subordinates. </li>
			<li>They strive to achieve self-sufficiency (with the intention to have more control) without realizing that ‘interdependence’ is not a blasphemy amidst the sweeping winds of change. </li>
			<li>They are not inclined towards ‘experimentation’ – they never tolerate failures and wilfully deny rewarding a ‘good attempt’. </li>
			<li>Most of them are not good listeners. </li>
			<li>They talk about the importance of ‘human resources’ but never do anything about it seriously. HRD is used as a decorative frill. </li>
			<li>They are never sure of the direction in which they are leading their people. They lack clarity and do not have a mental map of the various segments and activities, which need to be integrated. </li>
			<li>They lack a holistic approach. They manage through ‘snapshots’. </li>
			<li>They are not clear about the principles on which the success of their business is based. They confuse their people and pass on their confusion to them. This confusion generates more confusion. </li>
			<li>They do not know how to stay simple. They expand and make the organization top heavy. This only further complicates the issues. </li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Stone-age bosses dislike</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Making people feel they are important. </li>
			<li>Respecting the dignity and honour of people. </li>
			<li>Trusting people. </li>
			<li>Creating a transparent work culture. On the contrary, they believe in maintaining too many confidentialities; “I have the relevant information but it will be revealed only at the appropriate time”. The ‘appropriate time’ never comes. </li>
			<li>Supporting people to take risk. </li>
			<li>Stone-age boss loves to hate computers and IT technology. </li>
			<li>Making people feel that they are co-partners in the change process through openness in sharing information and transparency in functioning. </li>
			<li>Involving people - right from ‘idea generation’ to ‘implementation’. </li>
			<li>Demonstrating willingness to try out new ideas. </li>
			<li>Delegating and decentralizing the work. </li>
			<li>Demonstrating seriousness and commitment to transforming the organization. </li>
			<li>Identifying ‘strategic actions’ and evolving ‘action plans’ for converting ideas into reality. They prefer ‘status quo’; they love status quo. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Stone-age bosses harm the organization and bring down the morale of the people. They are the main cause of the corporate deadly disease known as ‘Injellititis’. “Hard times are sending some bosses back to the Stone Age,” observes Walter Keichel III in his article ‘When Management Regress’. “Beware yo-yo empowerment, cost-cutting mania, and the new McCarthyism… When the business went South, the brass sucked all the decision making back up to the top. Many organizations retreat from power sharing and open internal communication.” When such retreat takes place, people of competence choose not to interfere and sulk. They find their way out and leave the organization. This aggravates the disease and slowly the deadly disease ‘Injellititis’ brings the organization to a state of coma.</p>
		<p>What is ‘Injellititis’? When the organization keeps focus on internal issues by giving precedence to rules, regulation and procedures, and allows the customer, market and external factors to go out of focus, the company suffers a deadly ‘corporate disease’ – Parkinson calls it Injellititis! I am quoting a few symptoms of this deadly disease:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Work expands so as to fill the time available – everyone keeps busy to justify his position and workload. </li>
			<li>Action expands to fill the void created by human failure – everyone sweats it out cleaning the soiled floor without much value addition for the customer. </li>
			<li>Expenditure rises to meet income – and tends to surpass it. </li>
			<li>Delay in throughput and output by the employees. The management delay in rewarding its people hastens the incubation time of the disease. Delay is the deadliest form of denial – Stone-age bosses do not understand this. </li>
			<li>The time spent on any item in the agenda will be in inverse proportion to ‘customer focus’ – more time than required is given to non-issues.<br /> This brings the company to a stage which we call <em>coma</em>. At this stage, some peculiar tendencies can be witnessed. For instance:</li>
			<li>People at the helm of affairs are seen plodding and walking heavily. </li>
			<li>Stone-age bosses remain active in intrigue and scheming against the high-fliers, technocrats, marketing guys etcetera so as to put them down with the power of rules and procedures. They are fastened with the rules and silenced with the NIGYSOB (Now I Got You Son Of…). </li>
			<li>The hangmen gain strength by virtue of the code of conduct and the disciplinary and appeal rules of the company. They grow powerful. Holding the noose, they search for competent-risk-taking managers who have the guts to defy rules and override the procedures in the interest of the business and the customer – the beginning of the ‘<em>Escapism’ </em>game<em>. </em></li>
			<li>Committed people begin to withdraw their intellectual and emotional investment and do not flex their risk-taking muscles. </li>
			<li>Dissent is not tolerated. It is considered as insubordination or disobedience. </li>
			<li>If the Stone-age boss is second rate, he will see to it that his immediate staff is third-rate and, in turn, they see to it that their subordinates are fourth-rate. </li>
			<li>Smugness is the cardinal symptom. Everyone is seen hitting the target – either the bull’s eye is too big or the sitting duck is at too short a distance. </li>
			<li>When the specialists observe the unique combination of ‘bureaucratic approach’ and lack of ‘internal focus’, they start withdrawing. </li>
			<li>Sycophancy from top to bottom creeps into the hierarchy of the business system. </li>
			<li>If such Stone-age-practices dominate the organizations, there is an actual competition in stupidity. </li>
			<li>The high-fliers having diagnosed the disease – Corporate Injellititis – coolly find the fox holes as no one listens to them when they voice their words of caution from the roof-top. </li>
			<li>No spark of intelligence is left in the whole organization – the corporate bureaucrats talk about HRD and creativity without even understanding the basics of the softer aspects of business deals.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The final stage may linger on for years while the company slowly dies with the kiss of the Stone-age approach, leaving the corporate bureaucrats wondering – “I controlled ‘costs’ at all costs…!” “I followed the systems, rules and regulations so scrupulously and unerringly…!”</p>
		<p>Strange! We defend our wrongs with more vigour than we do our rights!</p>
		<p>The worst part is not that they behave like ’Stone-age Managers’ but that they take pride in being ‘Stone-age creatures’.</p>
		<p>Death pops up no red flags on the CEO’s table. The company eventually succumbs to the deadly disease. Like rats spread plague, the Stone-age managers and bosses are the carrier of this corporate disease, ‘Injelliititis’.</p>
		<p>In HMT I had one such Stone-age boss. I was working as General Manager (Human Resource). The post of Director (HR) fell vacant before I attained the eligibility to compete for it. The opportunity went in favour of an external candidate. The position of Director HR went to RA Sharan (not his real name) on a platter. He was working in one of the sick public sector companies in Assam. Luck favoured him. He joined HMT as director HR. He was highly bureaucratic in his approach. After discussing the issues over the telephone or personally in his office, he would insist that a written document be given even for day-to-day routine matters. Building records and creating reports were given more priority than business results. He was highly power conscious.</p>
		<p>Once he asked me, “Mr Siddiqui, I have often noticed that you exercise powers not delegated to you as per the ‘delegation of powers’ manual. I suggest you read the manual and restrain from approving certain notes which are beyond your competence.” He thought this advice might make me wiser. I simply replied, “Sharanji, so long as my signatures are honoured by the finance people and other departments, I will go on approving the proposals in the interest of this organization for speedy process. I have never read the manual known as ‘delegation of powers’, nor do I wish to read it. The day my signatures are not honoured, the paper that you will receive will be my resignation.” I boldly looked unwaveringly into his eyes. That was the last time he made any such comment.</p>
		<p>Once RA Sharan called me to his room and came out with the suggestion to create an HR network of Bangalore-based public sector and private sector organizations. I appreciated his idea and promised that within a couple of days he would get an effective network with all the requisite data and information. After two days he called me and appreciated the efforts of my team and suggested that we host a business dinner for the HR Heads of the Bangalore-based organizations. I again appreciated his professional gesture. But he wanted me to calculate the expenses that would be incurred and to submit a note in writing giving details of the breakup of each cost. Since we had discussed this and I had already given him a rough idea of the expenses I thought such a note was not warranted at that stage as no final decision had been taken. I shared my views frankly and said, “Sharanji, we have discussed over a couple of hours the issue of hosting a dinner without arriving at any result. Before you took over, we used to arrange many business meetings over dinners in star hotels and clubs just by verbal instructions. Sanctions were obtained later to regularize the expenditures.” He smiled and said, “Mr. Siddiqui, those were hay days of HMT when the company was making good profits.” He looked at me, confident that he had caught me on the wrong foot. I replied, “Sharanji, it is just other way around. Since we were hosting many dinners and freely associating with our HR colleagues, HMT had its hay days.” He thought for a while and said, “Perhaps you are right. What you said to me makes good sense.” Then I explained to him the power of ‘collective consciousness’ which can create and un-create situations around us. Both war and peace are created by ‘collective consciousness’. He who sees all beings in his own self and his own self in all beings, loses all fear. Likewise, those who see all beings in his own self and his own self in all beings gains all love. We human beings are ‘inter-beings’. Even in the aloneness of solitude, between two human beings, like an invisible shadow, there exists an ‘inter being’!</p>
		<p>RA Sharan thought for a while and said with a smirk on his face that made his his jaws prominently visible, “Siddiqui, your words are phonetic; they sound pleasant to the ears. But your thoughts are just poetic and make no sense in this material world.” I thought it better not to pursue the point further. It takes time to grow in wisdom. I could have argued with him that five-sensory personalities are near to <em>animality</em>. The Corporate World today is looking for multi-sensory personalities who can manage beyond the five sensory perceptions – Extra Sensory Perceptions (ESP). He thought he had won a point. My withdrawal from the argument was taken as a sign of his success.</p>
		<p>He was a typical personality with a very soft exterior and a really hard interior. Such persons are difficult bosses. It took me many months to understand his real self. He was a classic case of a Stone-age boss. Many things that were common knowledge to even junior managers were Greek and Latin for him. Once he asked me, “Siddiqui, whenever I meet the Chairman, he asks me to create a Learning Organization in HMT. I don’t know what is meant by a ‘learning organization’.” I smiled and simply told him, “I will come back to you tomorrow.”</p>
		<p>Next day I bought Peter Senge’s book ‘The Fifth Discipline’ and gifted the book to him. He was surprised. I told him that it explains in detail how to build a learning organization. Later we had many sessions. The ice was broken. He took me into his confidence and I gave my knowledge to him happily and with no regrets.</p>
		<p>It was the turning point in our relationship. So long as I was contesting against him, he always tried to put me down. When I sincerely pondered upon this hostile situation by empathetically putting myself in his shoes, wisdom dawned to me. It was not his <span>fault. He was working in a ‘C’ class public sector organization and had got his posting at a far-flung remote area. Obviously, he missed the opportunity of upgrading his knowledge and competencies. Once he lost his ‘pace’ in the fast moving business, he lost the race. It was not his fault. Had I been in his place, perhaps I too would have slipped into antiquity. This new wisdom helped me in changing my attitude towards him. Without giving him the feeling that he did not know many things, I started imparting knowledge to him during our informal meetings. I also presented him with a few important management books which he accepted gracefully. He understood that I was not his bête noire but his <em>shubh-chintak (well wisher)</em>. Things changed for the better. We worked together creating good synergy. </span></p>
		<p>I have read many case studies and created many myself but this case study, which I call ‘Daruwala’, is very relevant in this context. It depicts a live situation! In my sessions, I give this case study and ask people to enact the roles of Daruwala, Krishnan and Saxena. After they play the roles, I analyse the roles as well as the situation. Then I share with the participants the art of managing such ‘Daruwala Bosses’!</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>How to Manage a Stone-age boss?</strong></p>
		<p>It was a wet Monday morning in the suburbs of Bombay as Krishnan got out of bed and stared out of the window. “Another day,” he muttered to himself, “and another confrontation with Daruwala.” His mood reflected the gloomy, rain-threatening weather outside. “Surely, a 26 year-old MBA is meant for better things,” thought Krishnan. Struggling out of bed, his train of thought led him to reflect on how he had joined the Excel Bank a couple of years ago.</p>
		<p>Shortly after completing his Masters in Economics &#38; obtaining an MBA from a Premier Business institute, Krishnan, then a young man of 24 years, got a job as a Junior Executive in the Deposits Department of the Excel Bank, a private sector undertaking located at Flora Fountain. He was responsible for supervising 10 clerks who were engaged in accepting, processing and answering customer enquiries. He reported to the Manager-Retail Banking, Daruwala, who in turn reported to the Branch Manager, Saxena. The office staff reported directly to the Manager-Retail Banking.</p>
		<p>He thought of his immediate superior, Daruwala. The 49-year old Daruwala had been with the bank for 20 years and had risen to his present position through hard work and perseverance. During his career, as a junior and later as a senior bank executive, he had watched the bank grow and progress. He often referred to the increase in the number of employees under his supervision with a great deal of pride.</p>
		<p>His aversion to the ‘new breed of intellectuals and creative brains’, as he put it, coming into the bank was legendary. “These kind of people don’t know when good enough means good enough. These so-called ‘professional people’ can alienate customers and destroy the bank’s systems for they don’t have any experience” was Daruwala’s attitude towards the young creative breed of the bank’s managerial employees. Only the previous week Krishnan had overheard Daruwala remarks at the bar of the bank’s club. “I suspect their allegiances; they only demand autonomy,” Daruwala had asserted in no uncertain terms. “These guys think they are too smart and form an inner club with their own rules, and their loyalties appear to be with the technical specialty of their profession rather than with <strong>my bank.</strong>” (“<em>My bank</em>,” thought Krishnan; when had he bought it?) As he got ready for work, Krishnan reflected on the work he had to do at Excel Bank.</p>
		<p>According to Krishnan, his work at the bank was not challenging. His main duty was to verify the attendance of the office assistants each morning, to make sure that ‘everything was in order’, to answer queries concerning deposits and to meet the few depositors who dropped into the bank.</p>
		<p>He also prepared special reports and monthly progress charts as and when required by the Branch Manager’s office or by Daruwala. But such occasions were rare. He did not have much work to do, and he estimated that on an average he worked for no more than three and half hours a day.</p>
		<p>He also felt that the knowledge he had gained through his education was unutilized.</p>
		<p>Krishnan was enthusiastic and confident of his own ability. After completing his training period, he developed some strong convictions concerning the supervision of the office employees. The high rate of absenteeism and the apathy of many of the employees towards their work irked him. He realized that he was new to the organization. Nevertheless, he suggested certain measures which he felt would improve the situation. Daruwala, however, paid no attention to the suggestions. In fact, Daruwala confided to a retired colleague of his that, “This new lot coming in have a major problem. To maintain their mystique and culture or because their language tends to be filled with technical or scientific jargon, they establish barriers between them and what they consider <em>lay</em> people like me. Well, Krishnan reports to me and his performance appraisal is coming up soon. He will soon learn <em>who</em> is the boss!”</p>
		<p>To utilize his unproductive time, Krishnan suggested that as he had some knowledge about the modern techniques of banking he would like to take some lecture sessions for the employees on the new deposit-linked instruments available for the public. This would also improve their work efficiency. He volunteered to conduct these sessions once or twice a week as a part of his regular work without claiming any extra honorarium. But Daruwala did not feel that this suggestion was worth considering. Events soon began to crystallize into a confrontation. One day Mohanlal, a typist, suddenly fell ill and Krishnan permitted him to go home before closing time. Daruwala was not in the office at that time. When he came to know of this, Daruwala told Krishnan that the latter did not have the authority to take such decisions and in the future, all such cases should be referred only to him. Krishnan, however, felt that in the absence of Daruwala he had the right to take such decisions, and moreover, as Mohanlal’s sickness was genuine, he had taken the correct decision.</p>
		<p>Some time back Banerjee, the Internal Auditor, had suggested some changes in the sitting arrangement of the staff in the banking hall to accommodate a new assistant who had recently joined the Internal Audit section. Krishnan was in favour of this but Daruwala did not agree to the suggestion as he felt that his section was already crowded. The matter was ultimately referred to the Methods Research section; it had to study the layout of the sitting arrangements.</p>
		<p>On his way to work, Krishnan’s car suffered a flat tyre and this delayed him considerably. His mood, never happy at the best of times, had recently taken a new plunge where anger at his boss and frustration with his work were beautifully blended together.</p>
		<p>Krishnan’s chance to vent his feelings was, however, destined to come sooner than he anticipated. The genesis of this chance was of recent origin.</p>
		<p>As the bank was growing, the management had decided to instal a new electronic data processing centre for processing staff salary payments. Last week Saxena, the Branch Manager, had called Krishnan to his office as Daruwala was on leave. He thought that Krishnan, an MBA, would be able to add some new angle to the bank’s computerization plan. He spent about two hours with Krishnan explaining to him the objectives of the installation of the proposed system. He asked Krishnan to think over it and put up suggestions, if any.</p>
		<p>Krishnan was enthusiastic about Saxena’s approach and had spent several hours over the weekend working out a plan that would permit the new computer to be installed in his area with minimum hassles. He submitted the plan to Saxena shortly thereafter.</p>
		<p>Saxena was very impressed with Krishnan’s ideas and had called a meeting of the concerned officers, including Daruwala, today to review the plan.</p>
		<p>At 2.30 p.m, Daruwala entered the office hall and slammed the folder containing Krishnan’s plan on his table. “What is this?” he asked angrily. Before Krishnan could reply, Daruwala began to lecture him in a loud voice about the necessity of going through ‘proper channels’ while submitting reports. These remarks attracted the attention of the staff in the banking hall. Most of the staff stopped their work to watch the disturbing scene.</p>
		<p>Krishnan was much perturbed about this unforeseen situation and said in a loud voice, “Nothing, I have done nothing wrong.” But when he realized that people around him were watching them, he suggested that they might continue their discussion in Daruwala’s office, which was separated from the hall. Daruwala snatched the folder from Krishnan’s table and stormed into his own office. Krishnan followed sulkily.</p>
		<p>What must have happened in the closed room is anybody’s guess! Daruwala shouted in his loud voice and ridiculed Krishnan, threatening that he would spoil his appraisals and see to it that his career was ruined. Daruwala, convinced that Krishnan was trying to keep him out of the loop on purpose to tarnish his image, paid no heed to any explanation given by Krishnan.</p>
		<p>After the participants play the roles of Krishnan, Saxena and Daruwala, I ask them to analyse each character and find out the root-cause of the situation which had spiralled out of control. I also ask them to suggest the ways and means to handle such ticklish situations and bosses like Daruwala.</p>
		<p>I ask the same questions to my readers. Ponder for a while and let me know the root-cause. Was it Saxena’s calling Krishnan and giving him the assignment directly the root cause? No, that incident was not the real root-cause. That incident only triggered the explosive situation. The volcano was already there; it could have erupted anytime. That particular incident was an ‘effect’ not the ‘cause’, let alone the root-cause.</p>
		<p>Let us analyse the character of Daruwala to understand the personality profile of many ‘Stone-age bosses’. Daruwala was a sincere, loyal and experienced bank manager but he was bureaucratic, rigid and egoistic.</p>
		<p>When does a person become ‘Egoistic’? A person becomes egoistic when he has some deficiencies in his personality. To cover these deficiencies he projects himself to be larger than life-size. He behaves in an egoistic manner which makes people think he is suffering from a ‘superiority complex’. But, most interestingly, Psychology does not recognize this ‘superiority complex’. Psychology recognizes only two types of complexes: (1) Inferiority complex and (2) Oedipus complex. A person behaves in a ‘superior’ manner to hide his ‘inferior’ feelings within. Since he suffers from an ‘inferiority complex’, he shows off his ‘superiority’ to cover his inner inferiority.</p>
		<p>What was the inner deficiency of Daruwala? His inner deficiency was his ‘obsolete knowledge’. Though he was loyal, sincere and hard-working, somehow he lagged behind in the race as he could not brush up his existing knowledge. When Krishnan joined his team, Daruwala took him to be a great threat to his existence. Krishnan was professionally qualified with IT skills. He was a creative person who had many plans to innovate the banking system. Instead of taking all these positive qualities of Krishnan as the strength of the team, Daruwala regarded Krishnan as his rival. His apprehension was that ‘Krishnan would supersede him quickly’. And when Saxena called Krishnan directly and gave an important assignment to him, keeping Daruwala out of the loop, he felt his position at the bank was really ‘threatened’. As per his way of thinking, what he had apprehended turned out to be true. A very insignificant incident was made into a big issue and then he created bad blood by washing the dirty linen in public.</p>
		<p>How to handle such situations?</p>
		<p>Let me first explain how Krishnan should have managed the situation. In fact, this was a great opportunity for Krishnan to bury the hatchet by taking advantage of the situation. He should have simply contacted Daruwala, his immediate boss, over the phone and enquired about his health as he had not come to the office. Then, after winning Daruwala’s heart by this personal enquiry, he should have kept him informed about what had transpired between him and Mr.Saxena making it very clear that though, in view of the urgency, he had submitted the report to Mr.Saxena, he had kept a copy of the same for Daruwala’s perusal so that he could study and discuss it with Krishnan before meeting Mr.Saxena, the chief boss. This simple exercise could have helped not only in averting such a situation but also patched up the differences between the two of them.</p>
		<p>Now let me explain how Daruwala could have taken ‘Krishnan’s posting’ to his department. He should have welcomed Krishnan as a part of his team. Both could have made a better complementary team – Daruwala’s experience and Krishnan’s knowledge. When knowledge is given the buttress of experience it creates miracles. When experience is added to knowledge it creates wonders. Daruwala could not understand this simple principle and lost a great opportunity.</p>
		<p>In my understanding, <em>Daruwalas</em> in any given situation have only two options - (1) to collaborate with the <em>Krishnans</em> and create synergy by forgetting their ‘ego’ OR (2) to contest the <em>Krishnans </em>by learning the basics again themselves.</p>
		<p>If I were Daruwala, I would have talked to Krishnan frankly telling him that I could not upgrade my knowledge and skills and lost the pace in facing the challenges of present-day business. I would have, then, requested Krishnan to spend some time with me and help me to upgrade my knowledge and skills so that I can keep matching pace with modern times. It is a simple option but many will not avail of this option because one needs to kill one’s ego first. It is not a very simple option for people of ego. Alternatively, they must go for the second option. One should keep one’s foot on the chest of the computer and learn it. There is no third option to my way of understanding. <em>Daruwalas</em> survived yesterday, some have survived even today. But, believe me, <em>Daruwalas</em> will not have any place tomorrow. So, learn, learn and <em>learn</em>!</p>
		<p>Let me share with you the secret of my life. Had that incident not taken place, I too would have grown into a Daruwala.</p>
		<p>This incident took place during my posting at the Baira Siul Project of NHPC – National Hydro-Electric Project. Let me first explain something about NHPC. It was a forcibly created public sector unit in the sense that all the projects which were carried out by ‘Central Public Works Development (CPWD)’ were assigned to the newly formed public sector unit, NHPC. There was no public sector culture, let alone ‘business culture’. Everyone was following the obsolete rules and regulations like FR (Fundamental Rules) or SR (Service Rules). There was no PMS – Performance Management System. NHPC, with the heritage of CPWD, was at the level of ‘Confidential Dossiers’ or ‘Confidential Reports’, popularly known as ACRs. When I was posted there as ‘Personnel Officer’, people mistook me to be the Personal Officer to the CEO. They were surprised as the CEO already had a Personal Secretary. Why then was an additional ‘Personal Officer’ attached to him?</p>
		<p>I recall…</p>
		<p>It was a spine-biting, chilly Sunday morning in the Himalayas. I was in a relaxed mood when I got a call from AS Chatrath, my CEO, who lived in one portion of the guesthouse built on the top of the hill. Our township was in the valley. He wanted me to join him for breakfast. I had two options – either to call for a jeep from the transport department or to climb up, following the zigzag shortcuts. I decided to climb the hill.</p>
		<p>At the breakfast table, the silence was like a lull. The lull is a good indicator of a storm that is likely to follow! Between sips of hot coffee, he broke the silence by asking me point blank, “What is wrong with you?” Though I was prepared to face stormy weather after the lull, I was not ready for such a blunt question from Chatrath, my CEO.</p>
		<p>“I haven’t understood you, Sir,” I replied politely and a bit diplomatically to gain some time for counting to 10 and allowing my ‘A’ – the Adult – to emerge from my frightened ‘C’ (Child ego-state) and compute a rationale answer. Frankly speaking, I could not make out what he meant!</p>
		<p>“I am referring to the note which you had attached to the Manpower Plan of the Project,” he said. Now I remembered. I had put my name at the top in the list of ‘surplus executives’ at the project. “Are you not happy with me?” he asked, politely.</p>
		<p>“No sir, there is nothing like that…,” I replied.</p>
		<p>“Then why do you want to go? You know quite well how much I like your work. You also know how much I trust you. To be frank, I need you.”</p>
		<p>I was moved and just broke down – the ice was broken in the real sense. I explained to him how I was regarded as an odd-manout in the total project - governed by the FRs, SRs, CPWD manuals etc. (Fundamental Rules, Service Rules of the Central Government and Central Public Works Department’s manuals). All these did not jell with the concepts I was taught. These rules were meant to manage the Government machinery. They belonged to bureaucracy and not to entrepreneurship; the modern management and the scientific management techniques did not approve of bureaucratic practices. Here he stopped me by looking straight into my eyes and said, “I too was a young and energetic manager a couple of decades ago. I too tried to change the world. But the world didn’t change. Slowly I changed myself. Today you talk of ‘modern management’, ‘scientific management’ and arouse a strange feeling in me that I have become obsolete. After a couple of decades, you too will grow old like me and sit on this chair. And some young and smart junior executive will sit before you – as you are sitting today. Then, he will tell you, with more force than you told me today, that you have gone obsolete – your knowledge and your approach and your thoughts and your practices and your ideas do not conform with the modern management. Believe me, you will not relish the truth. What you think is modern management today will not be of any relevance tomorrow.” There was a silence – a deep silence, which was surely not a lull.</p>
		<p>As it happens in any parable, it happened then. Wisdom dawned upon me. While returning from the CEO’s guesthouse, after making a strange compromise between old and modern thoughts, for the first time I realized the bare truth – everything that is modern today will be obsolete tomorrow. And I could not be an exception to such a natural phenomenon. The only antidote I could think of was to get back to the basics – “<em>Let the changing basics of every time be perfected,”</em> I firmly decided. I owe a lot to AS Chatrath whose brutal frankness made me wiser.</p>
		<p>Since then I have been struggling hard for a face-lift. Yet, whenever I look in the mirror, I always see a Stone-age manager staring back at me and showing me the dust of obsolescence that has gathered on my very existence. The pace of change is much faster than I could ever visualise. I shiver in my spine even at the thought that tomorrow someone will come and sit before me and raise a finger at me saying, “You have gone obsolete. Your thoughts do not conform to modern management.” I get back to learning – learning from the seniors, from peers, from juniors and even from my own children.</p>
		<p>More than three decades have passed. I never compromise with the issue of learning. Had that incident not taken place and wisdom not dawned on me, perhaps, I repeat, perhaps I might have grown as a Stone-age Boss creating problems for many and spoiling the careers of many, besides destroying many organizations.</p>
		<p>Understand the psyche and background of the Stone-age Bosses and treat them as I treated RA Sharan and follow the tips I have given to Krishnan on the issue of “How should Krishnan have managed Daruwala” !</p>
		<p><em><strong>Master Tip :</strong>Remember one thing in life – you cannot choose your boss like you cannot choose your parents. When you understand this simple truth, the only option that remains with you (besides resigning or quitting) is maintaining a good relationship with your boss. Understand the ailments of such a Stone-age boss – try to cure the disease without hating the patient. It is possible. In a subtle manner give your knowledge to him without belittling him. Many of them know their weakness; they want to learn. But they are shy-learners! </em></p>
