		<p>I had a colleague, Bhaskar Raju (not his real name). He was heading the Personnel Department in another factory of my company. His people used to share many stories about him. One such story is quite relevant to the topic. It appears that he used to come to office late - just after lunch - not sometimes but most of the time. He would relax and read newspapers and magazines. His day would start after the evening tea was served. Then, he would call his staff to his room, one-by-one, and judge their progress. The last guy’s turn would come sometime late in the evening. When they were completely exhausted they were loaded with new work. Each new task was labelled ‘Priority task’.</p>
		<p>His lady secretary would leave the office at 5.30 pm as she had to board the company’s bus. But his male secretary had to sweat it out until the boss left the office. After 8 pm he would start calling his corporate bosses disturbing them at their residence. Since the call was given by the secretary, Raju did not have to state that he was speaking from the office. One thing which he would never forget to mention to his bosses was, “Sir, I am dying with the workload.” It was no wonder that in the corporate office he earned the nickname ‘Busy Raju’. This I came to know when my Director Personnel asked me, “How is Mr Busy Raju, your counterpart in the Bearings factory?” In a subtle manner he made it clear that people sitting in the Ivory Towers cannot be deceived by such third rate tricks. I never shared this comment with Raju and he continued with his buffoonery thinking himself to be a smart guy.</p>
		<p>“Don’t you see, I am busy?” is the favourite sentence of Mr Busy Boss. They feel happy so long as they are seen to be busy by people. They feel glad when someone will tell them, “Sir, take care of your health – work is not everything!”</p>
		<p>‘I am OK so long as I am busy’ is the psyche of Busy bosses. They, somehow, like to be seen to be very busy. Their secretaries understand their psyche. Whenever anybody wants to meet him, the secretary will say, “Boss is very busy. He is in meeting.” She, however, is fully aware that her boss is actually chit-chatting over coffee with some officers as a pastime!</p>
		<p>There are four kinds of ‘Busy Bosses’</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Procrastinator busy bosses </li>
			<li>Disengaging busy bosses </li>
			<li>Distracting busy bosses </li>
			<li>Purposeful busy bosses</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let me briefly explain what I mean by these sub-titles.</p>
		<p><span class="num">1. </span><strong>Procrastinator busy bosses:</strong> These guys are those who have already spent their energy and lost focus. It is believed that 30% of corporate bosses in Industry as well as in Bureaucracy are busy procrastinators. They delay the process and do not take timely decisions because they lack both <em>energy</em> and <em>focus</em>. Yet they will keep busy by writing comments on the file ‘Please discuss’, ‘Take it up in the next meeting’, ‘Please speak up’, ‘Can we defer it for sometime and wait and see?’ Why do they behave in that manner? In most of the cases they feel ‘insecure’ and suffer from ‘fear of the future’ – what will happen if I commit a mistake! From where does this fear come? It comes from the level of their impotence. It is also possible that at some point in their lives they were punished or suffered negative consequences when they took an initiative. I would like to share one very important point. Procrastination does not wholly depend on one’s personality; it can be influenced by organizational behaviour.</p>
		<p><span class="num">2. </span><strong>Disengaged Busy Bosses:</strong> As per some studies, around 20% busy bosses fall in this category. The problem with these bosses is though they are quite focussed they have low levels of energy – no fire in the belly. So, though they want to perform they remain disengaged most of the time owing to their low energy levels. They have clear goals but pursue them half-heartedly. Their mind-set can be explained in terms of what is known as ‘defensive avoidance’. They understand the need yet do not take the initiative. Purposely they delay taking decisions and invest little energy in making the right ‘cut’. Again, for such type of behaviour the person alone is not responsible; organizational behaviour is equally responsible in creating such disengaged bosses. When their creative initiatives were not appreciated by the organization, they became withdrawn. Then they had energy but they did not get support; now they do not have energy and management expects some creative initiative from them! Once people, especially senior people, sulk it is difficult to enthuse them. To overcome their deficiency, they pretend to be busy. </p>
		<p><span class="num">3. </span><strong>Distracted busy bosses:</strong> Into this quadrant fall many – around 40% - of busy bosses. They have the energy but lack focus. They are bubbling with energy but do not know how to discharge it. So, they behave like the ‘unguarded missiles’. They desperately need to do ‘something’ but they do not know what is that ‘something’ they want to do. With lot of energy and no sense of direction, they behave proverbially like a ‘bull in a China shop’. These bosses tend to be short-sighted and often overcommitted. Again, the fault is not always with such bosses; in many cases they become the victim of bad organizational behaviour. When they were occupying junior positions, they were bubbling with enthusiasm but their seniors never guided them. So they turned into some sort of ‘unguarded missile’. Since they have to keep themselves busy to discharge their high levels of energy, they go on hitting out in this direction or that direction like a beetle which goes on hitting into the walls in an attempt to find a way out and starts ‘bleeding’.</p>
		<p><span class="num">4. </span><strong>Purposeful Busy Bosses:</strong> They are the smallest in number – around 10% of busy bosses. The prime reason of their effectiveness is that they very focussed and highly energetic. They have fire in their belly as well as clear vision in the mind – they know where they want to go, how they want to go. They are absolutely clear about their objectives, goals and vision. They set their time-frame and try to accomplish their defined goals within the stipulated time-frame. They have ‘clarity of goals’ and ‘exploding energy’. They are self-aware and self-inspired bosses. They have two positive forces – clarity of direction and zealous energy. They think, reflect, plan, move and achieve.</p>
		<p>There is a popular saying, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to go to the forest to gather wood, saw it and nail the planks together. Just create the <em>passion</em> for the sea – challenge and choice.”</p>
		<p><strong>A few tips</strong></p>
		<p>If they are busy bosses, they will remain busy come what may. You can manage such bosses by complementing their deficiencies. Let me explain this for each type of Busy Boss :</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Your <em>Procrastinator Busy Bosses</em> lack both energy and direction, yet they love to be busy. It is a golden opportunity for the subordinate managers to use their own vision and energy; what is needed is the bosses support and confidence. You should not try to grab the credit – let them get the credit and then you will see they give you full support. </li>
			<li>Your <em>Disengaged Busy Bosses</em> have clarity of vision but they have already spent their energy. Seek guidance from them and give them support through your exploding energy. He has the eyes, you can become his limbs and then you will see the miracle. </li>
			<li>Your <em>Distracted Busy Bosses</em> have a reservoir of unspent energy but they do not know in which direction they should get it exploded. You become their eyes and show them the right direction. </li>
			<li>Your <em>Purposeful Busy Bosses</em> are capable stalwarts- who have energy as well has the vision. Take full advantage of their strengths and seek guidance. You will find them very supportive. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Remember, many busy bosses have four expectations from their subordinates:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They are ‘detail oriented’ and want everything in detail. Brevity is not their cup of tea.</li>
			<li>Mostly they are ‘hands-on’ sort of people. They want to know what is happening in the organization.</li>
			<li>They will not accept the fact that their subordinates know more than them. They like ‘low profile’ people.</li>
			<li>They pretend they are short of time. So they expect their people to constantly display not only through words but also through their body language – <em>Madam, I know you are busy; let me take just two more precious minutes from you. </em></li>
		</ol>		
		<p><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Choose a task your boss does not do well or like to do. You will be relieving your boss of the burden rather than seeming to invade his or her turf. </em></p>
