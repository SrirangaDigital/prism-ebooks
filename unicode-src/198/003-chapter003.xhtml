		<p>It was a cold, blood-clotting winter evening when I landed at the Srinagar airport in the month of January. I had visited this beautiful valley many times and ‘biting cold’ was not a new experience for me. But this time I felt as if the cold breeze was piercing into my flesh, touching the bones. Had it been my choice, I would have avoided visiting this ‘Heaven-on-Earth’ valley during peak winter. But I was summoned for an emergency -to investigate a grave misconduct case involving a financial deal.</p>
		<p>As per protocol, I met Urs, the General Manager of Srinagar Watch Factory. He welcomed me without giving me a smile. When I shook hands with him I found no warmth in it. His secretary was courteous enough to serve hot tea (he did not even make a request for it). While his secretary was serving tea I broached the topic – the purpose of my visit. But he signalled me not to begin the discussion. When his secretary went out, he gave a deep sigh and said , “Now you can talk.” I understood what was on his mind. He did not want anyone else to hear our conversation. He briefed me about the case and then told me that he would invite the CVO – Chief Vigilance Officer – to share more details as well as show me the relevant documents.</p>
		<p>Kampasi, the CVO, was perhaps waiting outside for getting the ‘GM’s Summon’. He and the GM’s secretary entered the room holding the pile of files. Urs asked his secretary to put on the ‘red lamp’ and instructed him not to allow anyone to enter his room. The CVO explained the entire case to me and showed me the relevant evidence which he had collected in support of the case. He had done a meticulous task making my job easy. After the CVO left the room, the General Manager asked me my views. I explained that there was a good <em>prima facie</em> case for initiating disciplinary proceedings against two managers who were involved in the corrupt financial deal. The General Manager did not seem to be satisfied with my answer. He then confided to me that I should not trust the CVO and that I should carry out my investigations independently.</p>
		<p>“You know, these Kashmiris are always goody-goody with each other – you should not trust them. Though he has dealt with the case nicely and brought lots of information to the surface, yet we do not know if he may be hiding many facts or may be giving wrong information to make the case weak. You cannot trust them!” I thanked him for his advice and suggested that I would seek assistance from my HR colleague at the Srinagar unit. Urs virtually jumped from his chair, “You mean Bhargava?” I nodded my head in affirmation.</p>
		<p>“Never do such a mistake – he is the most untrustworthy guy. I have my own suspicions about him.” Then he enquired suspiciously, “Have you already discussed this case with him?” I smiled and said, “No – not yet .”</p>
		<p>“No, don’t even let him know the purpose of your visit. Though he is not a Kashmiri, yet I cannot trust him. I have my own suspicions about him. You can tell him that you have visited this factory to solve some Industrial Relation issues.” I nodded my head as I had no other option. He was suggesting to me to tell a lie to Bhargava who knew all about the Industrial Relation issues of Srinagar. How could have I told him that I had come there to solve an IR issue! Urs’ suggestion was something like suggesting to a pregnant lady to tell a lie to the mid-wife that she has not yet conceived.</p>
		<p>“Then, can I take the assistance of the Finance chief?” I asked. “Since this case relates to financial irregularities, he will be the right person to assist me.”</p>
		<p>“You mean Razdan — the Kashmiri Pandit!” he asked.</p>
		<p>“Yes,” I replied, coolly. “He is a nice gentleman. I know him from the time he was in the corporate office.”</p>
		<p>“You know him?” he asked nervously. “Have you already shared this case with him?” He asked this question as if he was convinced that I had already shared some information with Razdan. Despite my telling him that I had not discussed this issue with anyone, he remained suspicious. He asked another question in a probing tone.</p>
		<p>“Who came to the airport to receive you?”</p>
		<p>“Abdul Rabb.”</p>
		<p>“You mean the Rabb of HR Department?”</p>
		<p>“Yes.”</p>
		<p>“Oh my God! He is a mischief monger. He must have already spread the news in the factory about the purpose of your visit. He is a very cunning guy.”</p>
		<p>“But I have not revealed anything to him though he kept asking me what made me visit this unit so suddenly.”</p>
		<p>“He asked so!” exclaimed the GM, in a very serious tone. “I don’t know why Bhargava chose Rabb to receive you at the airport. They all are one.”</p>
		<p>“Why are you so apprehensive about Kashmiris?” Somehow I could not resist asking him this delicate question. However, he did not mind my query. He paused for a minute. “Because, it is ‘they’ versus ‘me’!” he replied.</p>
		<p>“I couldn’t get you!” I said. Though I had understood the hint that he had given to me indirectly, yet I waited to hear more from him.</p>
		<p>“You know I am from South India – I am not one among them. They all are one.”</p>
		<p>“But Bhargava is a Rajasthani!” was my prompt reply.</p>
		<p>“He is most untrustworthy,” he interrupted. “I can trust the local fellows but not Bhargava.”</p>
		<p>“And Rabb, I mean Abdul Rabb…”</p>
		<p>“Mr. Siddiqui, you do not know your own HR guys. He is from Ajmer, the same State. He is a real rogue, the right-hand of Bhargava… In a way, I may trust Bhargava sometime but not Abdul Rabb. You cannot understand them.”</p>
		<p>We went on talking for an hour with the red bulb on and the GM’s visitors waiting for him in the adjacent room. Any name I suggested to him, he had some issue with that guy. I felt like telling him to arrange my return ticket by the evening flight. Sometimes I got the feeling that he was even suspecting my credibility! I left his room without any clue or guidance. During my one-hour discussion with him I learnt that except for him everyone else was a rogue, cheat and trouble monger!</p>
		<p>I decided to take charge of the situation and started my investigations in a manner that I felt was right. The General Manager was not happy. Rather he was annoyed with me. Later when I reached Bangalore, my Director (HR) shared with me that Urs had made some discrete enquiries about me – he had a suspicion that I, being a Muslim, might be in cahoots with them. “He even blamed me for choosing you, a Muslim, for conducting investigations in Srinagar,” he said with a smile, as he shared this information with me openly. I narrated the entire story to my Director. He heard me out patiently.</p>
		<p>“I am not surprised,” said my Director. “Urs is known for his suspicious mind. You know, his wife, who is a doctor, has left him as he used to suspect her.” He shared this secret that was not known to me. “But, you know, he is the most honest person. The real problem with him is that he considers everyone else dishonest and suspects everyone’s integrity.”</p>
		<p>“Sir, to my mind, he is suffering from a mental disease – paranoia,” I replied hesitantly, as I shared my own ‘suspicions’ with my boss.</p>
		<p>“His nick name is Mr. Paranoid!” laughed my boss . “Do you know, who gave this wonderful title to him?” After a significant pause he said, “Our Chairman. In the inner circle of Directors we all call him Mr. Paranoid.”</p>
		<p>Later I collected more information about Mr. Paranoid. It appears that once he was in-charge of the Hyderabad factory. As a ‘forced bachelor’ he used to stay in one of the rooms of the company’s guesthouse. Hyderabad is known for ‘power-cuts’; electricity supply is a perennial issue. The city faces many planned shutdowns and unplanned power disruptions. It appears Urs considered such power disruptions as a part of the conspiracy by his Manager (Electrical) in connivance with the local electricity authorities.</p>
		<p>Most of the Paranoid bosses suffer from the mental ailment – paranoia. Some suffer from a minor mental ailment, medically known as ‘anxiety neurosis’. In both cases, the trigger point is a ‘negative attitude’- what is known in behavioural science as NMA (Negative Mental Attitude). For this reason, CEOs must take extra care to ensure that their managers receive inputs for ‘building positive attitudes’.</p>
		<p>There are some bosses who consider ‘appreciation’ to be a great sin. You do anything – even play a miracle by making an impossible thing possible – they will not utter a single word of ‘appreciation’, let alone pat the back or give a passionate hug (<em>jaddu ki jappi</em>)</p>
		<p>In my workshops on ‘Building a Positive attitude’, I very fondly narrate the following story which I had read in some book:</p>
		<p>There was once a hunter who bought a bird dog, the only one of its kind in the world – it could walk on water. He was very pleased that he could show off his new acquisition to his friends.</p>
		<p>He invited a friend to go duck hunting. After some time, they shot a few ducks and the man ordered his dog to run and fetch the birds. All day long, the dog ran on water and kept fetching the birds.</p>
		<p>The owner was expecting a comment or a compliment about this amazing dog but did not get one. As they were returning home, he asked his friend if he had noticed anything unusual about his dog. The friend replied, “Yes, in fact I did notice something unusual. Your dog cannot swim.”</p>
		<p>Pessimism is the sign of NMA – Negative Mental Attitude. The pessimists always see the glass ‘half empty’. In acute cases, pessimists turn paranoid. To add fun to my sessions, I explain some funny characteristics of pessimists.</p>
		<p>Pessimists:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Are unhappy when they have no troubles to speak of </li>
			<li>Feel bad when they feel good </li>
			<li>Spend most of their life at the complaint-counter </li>
			<li>Always turn out the lights to see, ‘How dark it is?’ </li>
			<li>Cannot enjoy their health because they think they may be sick tomorrow </li>
			<li>Not only expect the worst but make the worst of whatever happens </li>
			<li>Do not see the doughnut, only see the hole </li>
			<li>Believe that the sun shines only to cast shadows </li>
			<li>Forget their blessings and count their troubles </li>
		</ol>
		<p>The initial symptom of paranoia is the ‘pessimistic outlook’. The famous Indian actress – the Tragedy Queen – suffered this syndrome. Yes, you guessed right – it was Meena Kumari. The other actress, Parveen Babi, too was a case of acute paranoia and died a Paranoid.</p>
		<p>Urs is not a solitary case; there are many Mr. Paranoids in the real Corporate World. Is paranoia a negative characteristic of Leadership? Whereas many will say, ‘Yes’, yet some will not agree. One such business practitioner is Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, who became popular with his book ‘Only the Paranoid Survive’. He is perhaps the first author who considers ‘Paranoia’ as a positive trait of leadership. There are many admirers of this book. “One of my all-time favourite business books, and a huge influence on my leadership philosophy is Andy Grove’s ‘Only Paranoids Survive’,” wrote Regis Hadiaris in his book ‘Personal Development’.</p>
		<p>‘Only the Paranoids Survive’ is no doubt a wonderful book except for the title. Andy Grove has used the word ‘Paranoid’ as a positive connotation, which many have mistakenly accepted by taking the word at its surface value. In this book, Grove discusses <em>strategic inflection points</em>, ‘How leaders must identify them, and lead their teams through them!’</p>
		<p>What is a ‘Strategic Inflection Point?’ Grove defines a strategic inflection point as a time in the life of a business or project when its fundamentals are changing significantly. “Often, ‘Point’ is really a misnomer, and it is actually a long, sometimes painful, period of change” believes Grove. In his view the ‘strategic inflection points’ are those times and decisions that make or break your business, your project, your client relationship, your Executive’s view of you etc.,” holds Andy Grove. One could look at Strategic Inflection Points as ‘Tipping Points’ as well. To my mind, Grove seems to have got influenced by Gladwell’s popular book ‘The Tipping Point’.</p>
		<p>In the book ‘Only Paranoids Survive’, a ‘Paranoid Leader’ is one who: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Constantly tries to anticipate change. Only those who constantly anticipate change will survive when change happens. </li>
			<li>Seeks the opinion of all those around him as they are usually in touch with impending changes sooner than he is. </li>
			<li>Encourages debates at all costs. The most important tool in identifying a strategic inflection point is broad and intensive debate. </li>
			<li>Does not justify holding back because he does not know the answer – seeks them out as fast as he can. </li>
			<li>Gives his most considered opinion, clearly and forcefully. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>One can see how much positivity is infused in the negative word ‘Paranoid’. Andy Grove’s ‘Paranoid’ is a proactive, consultative, and an alert leader. If someone does not understand the contextual meaning of ‘paranoid’ and takes this word literally, one can get misled or mislead others.</p>
		<p>To be vigilant and proactive to survive in today’s fast changing business scenario, business leaders should self-introspect by asking themselves the following two vital questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Am I actively seeking opinions from everyone possible, regardless of their hierarchal status or title? </li>
			<li>Is our key competitor about to change? If yes, what are our business plans and strategies to gain the cutting-edge? </li>
		</ol>
		<p>The issue is not that the business leaders do not see the right direction the business world is heading to; the issue is that usually we act too late and too little. Business often fails because our business strategies are not supportive to ‘customer retention’ – either we leave them or they leave us. As per Andy Grove’s approach, lack of such understanding or lapses occur because people do not work like a Paranoid boss. Andy Grove’s ‘Paranoid’ is not the one who is highly suspicious. His Paranoid is the most successful entrepreneur who can alone survive and thrive in today’s world.</p>
		<p>If such smart proactive business leaders are called ‘Paranoids’, what title is left for those who are real paranoids?</p>
		<p>‘To be vigilant’ and ‘to be paranoid’ are not one and the same thing. On this point I totally disagree with Grove. Trusting everyone and trusting no one – both are bad. Rather mistrust is more dangerous than trusting everyone. Abraham Lincoln is right when he warns, “Believing everybody is dangerous; believing nobody is very dangerous.”</p>
		<p>As a business leader, we should not forget that each one of us is an ‘inter-being’- this means we cannot survive without the help and assistance of another person. Relationships are important in life as well as in corporate life. Relationships are built on trust, not on mistrust. How can you make your people trustworthy? ‘Just by trusting them’ is the only right answer.</p>
		<p>Like the hero of this chapter – Urs – there are many ‘misleaders’ who bring down the morale of people and tarnish the organisational culture of excellence just by creating frustration to satisfy their suspicious mind.</p>
		<p>“You cannot have success without Trust” – etch this saying in stone, if you can. “Building trust is the critical success factor of management, yet it is non-existence in today’s world!” observes Professor Richard D Aven of Dartmouth Business School. And Tom Peters emphasises this point by saying, “Technique and Technology are important, but adding Trust is the issue of the decade.”</p>
		<p>A Paranoid boss suffers from insecurity. He is highly suspicious in nature and he always carries a feeling that ‘some of his enemies are out to get him’. His door is always locked. The subordinates can deal with him through slips or his private secretary. Silence mystifies.</p>
		<p>The Paranoid bosses must understand that leadership is all about trust and faith. If you do not trust your people, ‘Why would anyone follow you for the uphill tasks, giving their best, sometimes even risking lives?’ asks Collin Powell, the former Deputy Secretary in Bush’s government, who was basically a great military guy. He resigned when he noticed his bleeding conscience.</p>
		<p>I offer the following tips for the Paranoid bosses who work on mistrust:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Be aware of ‘Bad execution of good Intent’</em> – A bad execution of good intent always gives you bad results. Not only the ends but also the means should be good. Good means for good ends should be your objective. Dealing with mistrust is a negative approach. Mistrust will always result in mistrust. </li>
			<li><em>Examine and Refine your Motives </em>– your motives, good or bad, are the product of your thoughts. Your thoughts can also be influenced by your motives. Both work upon each other. It has a snow-bowling effect. When dealing with people on the basis of trust we should examine and refine our motives, not only sometimes but always. </li>
			<li><em>Declare your intent — keep no hidden agendas. </em>Be open, be transparent. Transparency works; it plays miracles. One of the secrets of my success is my transparency. I always tell my people that life is not a game of chess where we have to plan secret strategic moves for winning the game. When I talk about transparency one must not misunderstand and demonstrate it by removing the curtains of one’s bedroom.</li>
			<li><em>Choose Abundance</em> — “The measure of your life will not be in what you accumulate, but what you give away,” writes Dr. Wayne Dyer in his book ‘The Power of Intentions’. What you give comes back to you. If you trust, people will trust you; if you mistrust, people will mistrust you. Life is like a mountain’s echo – what you shout you hear! </li>
			<li><em>Keep focus on ‘Solutions’ and helping others — Be positive! </em>Remember, every problem comes with a gift. See that gift first. Negative people, on the contrary, see a problem in every gift. You get what you focus on. If you keep focus on problems you will get them in abundance. If you keep focus on solutions you will get them in abundance. </li>
			<li><em>Your behaviour demonstrates your intent.</em> So, watch your behaviour so that it does not send out misleading signals. And on the other side, do not judge someone wrongly due to his ‘outward’ behaviour. </li>
			<li><em>Never ever compromise on the actions which may dishonour your credibility. </em>To protect your credibility, ponder upon these questions: </li>
			<li>What kind of results am I currently producing? </li>
			<li>Do those results increase or diminish my personal credibility? </li>
			<li>If hiring, to what extent would that person’s track record and current performance influence my decision? </li>
			<li>How good is my own track record? </li>
			<li>How good am I at identifying desired results and in executing plans effectively to accomplish those results? </li>
			<li>Does my performance inspire confidence and trust in others? </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Self-introspect – are you too suspicious OR are you too gullible? Both are two extreme ends of the normal bell curve, each occupying 20% portion. You should discard both these extreme ends and keep focus on the middle part of the curve, the 60% part of the popular Bell Curve.</p>
		<img src="images/0004.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p><em><strong>Master Tip: </strong>It is equally an error to trust all men or no man. Create a perfect balance between Trust and Gullibility – the two extremes of Smart Trust! Look for and go for: </em></p>
