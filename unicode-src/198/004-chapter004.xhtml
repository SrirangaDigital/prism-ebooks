		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">4. </span>Chocolate-cream Bosses</h1>
		<p>“When are you planning to go to Singapore?” Raj (not his real name), my boss, asked me.</p>
		<p>“Next week,” was my simple reply.</p>
		<p>“You are going with your family, right?” he asked.</p>
		<p>“Yes.” I chose to be brief again.</p>
		<p>“I understand your son stays there,” he shot back.</p>
		<p>“Yes.”</p>
		<p>My mind was still agitating over what had happened a couple of hours back in the factory. My boss and I had been sent by the Chairman to this factory in Hyderabad on a special mission. We were supposed to share with the employees and their union office bearers the hard fact that the board had decided to close down the factory. Though my boss minced his words, I made the corporate message loud and clear to them. In the same breath I also conveyed to them the management’s decision that they would be provided alternative jobs in other factories provided they were willing to move to other locations. The union was not very happy and threatened to strike. They also made clear that some employees would go for, what they called, a ‘fast unto death’ if the corporate management did not withdraw the decision. The meeting was prorogued to meet again the next day. We were ‘allowed’ by the union to rethink and convey the management’s final decision. We returned to the hotel.</p>
		<p>Sitting at the pool’s site, we were trying to relax by sipping hot South Indian coffee, when my boss all of a sudden enquired about my leave plans for visiting my son in Singapore.</p>
		<p>“Next week?” Raj repeated, in utter astonishment. “I don’t think you can go now.”</p>
		<p>“Why?” I asked. “My leave has already been sanctioned last week.”</p>
		<p>“Last week,” he repeated, accentuating the word ‘last’. After a brief pause he shared his thoughts. “Now that the union has threatened to go in for direct action, I don’t think the Chairman will allow you to go on a holiday.”</p>
		<p>“No problem,” I coolly replied. “If the union goes on strike, I will postpone my holiday.”</p>
		<p>“Oh! That’s not good,” said Raj, sympathetically. Perhaps he was not ready for this sort of answer. “No, you should never do that.”</p>
		<p>“I don’t think I have any other option if the union starts an IR stir.”</p>
		<p>“If… a great ‘If’,” he laughed. I still could not understand what he was trying to convey to me through his zigzag talk with the markings of a Chinese puzzle.</p>
		<p>“Why do you say so?” I asked my boss. “Have you any doubt? Do you feel the union is not serious about all that they said in the meeting?” Before I could raise my third question he stopped me by saying, “No, no, I don’t mean all that…”</p>
		<p>“Then?”</p>
		<p>“Listen,” he said, in a low tone. The pause was long this time. He was weighing his words before saying the next word. Then he simply smiled. He smiled a mysterious smile. “No point,” he murmured. “You will not understand…”</p>
		<p>I chose not to ask. He smiled again. The smile was no longer enigmatic; it was miserable this time. “No point,” he mumbled again. I felt a wave of relief thinking the talk was over. I was wrong. In fact the talk had not even begun. Raj was carefully reading my face searching for the matching words. Then, he pulled his bamboo chair near to me and made his final statement without any ambiguity.</p>
		<p>“Moid, listen to me carefully,” he whispered again. “If union goes in for direct action, neither can you go to Singapore nor can I retire peacefully. You know, after two month I am retiring. I have lived my life in peace. At the fag end of my career I would not like to buy trouble. I want to retire in peace. I also wish you should go with your family and enjoy a holiday with your son and his family in Singapore. Don’t decide in haste. Why should you or I take the brunt for the harsh decision taken by the board sitting in the Ivory Tower? I suggest you talk to the Chairman. He listens to your suggestions. Say the situation is turning violent and if we don’t withdraw the decision there will be bloodshed in the factory. Ask him to defer the decision till the next board meeting. And let us give assurance to the union at tomorrow’s meeting that no wrong will be caused to this factory; let them cool down.”</p>
		<p>I did not react. Rather I did not know how to react! Unperturbed by my facial expressions he went on to make the last kill. “Let us buy peace at any cost so that you can enjoy your holidays and I can make my retirement peaceful. Let the Chairman and board face the music if they don’t review the decision in the next board meeting in the union’s favour.”</p>
		<p>I kept mum for a while then smiled. Raj, my boss, heaved a sigh of relief taking my smile as my consent to what he had suggested to me little understanding what really caused me to smile.</p>
		<p>“Stupid!” I said to myself in my heart. What else could I have expected from Raj – a Chocolate-cream boss – who could never take a hard posture? At crossroads, Raj always used to choose the safest path.</p>
		<p>What happened later is not relevant; how Raj behaved when his personal peace was threatened is the issue.</p>
		<p>I adopted the term ‘Chocolate-cream boss’ from the military. In the military, the term ‘Chocolate-cream soldier’ is often used for a soldier who has never been seen in action on the battleground. In industries, many Chocolate-cream managers rise in the hierarchy without even understanding the basics of management rationale or facing the ground realities of setting up a new unit, developing an industrial complex, working in a manufacturing unit, turning around a sick company or facing ticklish situations that need guts and competence to tackle. Yet they grow to the heights of incompetence perhaps only to prove Peter Drusker's Principle. They grow by creating work suitable for such Chocolate-cream positions, reposing full faith in Parkinson’s Law. They grow superseding even the high-fliers, wearing the mask of a nice guy to confirm the truth of Gareth Gardiner’s thoughts – “In a large organization, the nice guy gets ahead because he or she is socially pleasant and agreeable. The nice guy follows directions and takes order well and doesn’t make waves… When the entire organization becomes top-heavy with ‘nice guys’, however, organizational disaster can unexpectedly occur.”</p>
		<p>This title of ‘Chocolate-cream’ is also used for nice guys. A nice guy knows that it is not the weathercock but the wind that changes its direction. He, therefore, takes care of the wind. He is watchful of organizational politics and tends to adjust himself to any circumstance. He is not too sure of his own strength. He always avoids confrontation for he himself lives in a glasshouse. He spends his energy on image building without realizing that one is never perceived by the other as per one’s projection. He is perceived as what he appears to them. He toils hard to gain self-mileage and growth in hierarchy. “He works hard enough and well enough at his job that he rises up the organization,” believes Gareth Gardiner.</p>
		<p>The cardinal objective of such Chocolate-cream bosses is to create a good image. They will not do anything by which their good image is affected. These guys can never say ‘No’ to anyone.</p>
		<p>Raj was such nice guy; he would never take any risk nor would he do anything by which his ‘nice-guy’ image got adversely affected. Later, luckily the same Raj became Director HR – my immediate boss. One strange characteristic of his personality was that <em>he would never say, “No!” </em>If he did not like a suggestion or idea or proposal, he would not say ‘No!’ but meticulously ensure that such a thing never happened. You could ask him a hundred times yet he would never disagree but also never do it. His subordinates understood that he would not allow a thing to be done in spite of not saying ‘No’ for it.</p>
		<p>Such Chocolate-cream bosses believe saying ‘No’ is unethical – saying ‘No’ will cause ‘losing face’. I do not think one should be so touchy about such things. When it comes to a crunch situation, one must dare to say ‘No’. A honest ‘No’ is better than a dishonest ‘Yes’. I can quote many such incidents where saying a dishonest ‘Yes’ caused unmanageable situations. Let me quote one more incident about Mr. Raj, my Chocolate-cream boss.</p>
		<p>Ms. Maya Devi (not her real name) was recruited as Deputy General Manager, Public Relations, in a public sector company. She became my colleague as she was reporting to a common boss, Director HR. She was excellent at her work. She did not take much time to create a good place for herself in just six months. Then something strange happened. The Vigilance Chief received an anonymous letter saying that Maya Devi was a cheat and that she had submitted false certificates of experience and professional qualifications. Vigilance enquiries revealed that she was simply an art graduate with no diploma in public relations and communication, and that all the experience certificates produced by her at the time of appointment were false. Obviously, hers was a strong case for disciplinary action and therefore, she had to be issued a charge-sheet.</p>
		<p>My boss Raj (Director HR), as mentioned earlier, was a ‘nice guy’ type of personality. He never wanted any trouble or tension. So he asked me to transfer Maya to the Chairman’s office to avoid signing a charge-sheet and initiating a disciplinary case against her. In many organizations, the PR Chief directly reports to the CEO of the company so it was not an issue for me to transfer her. My real anxiety was about the ‘disciplinary authority’. If she were transferred with reporting authority to the Chairman, the disciplinary authority would also shift from the Director (HR) to the Chairman. In the event of her eventual termination (under the authority of the Chairman), the appellate authority will shift to the level of the Board. The Board would first ask how she was recruited with such forged certificates and would fix responsibility on the Director HR for such gross negligence. I shared these apprehensions with Raj, my Director, and he immediately understood that he would land into trouble by transferring her to the Chairman’s office. So, she remained with the HR Directorate and eventually a domestic enquiry was initiated against her under the authority of Director HR – the ‘nice guy syndrome’ boss. He felt bad for performing such an ‘unholy task’.</p>
		<p>It was my bad luck that my boss chose me to be the Enquiry Officer. I had little option but to conduct the disciplinary enquiry against my own colleague. The case was very simple and Vigilance had all legal evidence against her. Yet, as per government rules, such formality was essential. During the enquiry, on many occasions, Maya Devi asked for my support saying that she had full confidence that I would shield her and declare her not guilty of charges. But I always used to say, “Maya, if you are proved innocent, no one can harm you but if you are proved guilty, no one can protect you.” Yet she was hoping against hope that I would protect her. Unfortunately, she was proven guilty as per the evidence on record and I had no option than to write the findings accordingly.</p>
		<p>The day came when it was decided to dismiss her from service. I prepared the dismissal order and went to my boss’s chamber to obtain his signature. He signed the dismissal order with a heavy heart and feeling of guilt. I collected the signed dismissal order and kept it in the folder. Before I could leave, Maya entered the room. My boss welcomed her with a nervous smile. “Sir, there are some rumours in the office that today I will be terminated,” she asked point-blank, looking directly into his eyes (neglecting me completely as if I was not there). I could not believe my ears when I heard my boss say loudly, “Maya don’t believe in rumours. So long as I am there in this seat of authority no one can ever touch you.” I secretly peeped through the papers; yes, her dismissal order was already signed by him! I thought it was the right time to make my exit but my Director told me to go after having a cup of coffee with Maya. In a way he celebrated his promise to Maya that ‘no one can harm her’. Obviously, Maya was quite jubilant over his assurance. After finishing my cup of coffee I left. I was surprised that my boss did not say anything to me. After coming back to my room, I waited for an hour or so thinking that my boss would call me and give me some fresh instructions for not issuing the dismissal orders to her. But nothing strange happened! So, after waiting for another hour, I sent my junior to go and serve the dismissal order to her by taking the help of security. Later, my junior reported that she took those orders calmly and signed the acknowledgment. My task was completed.</p>
		<p>Maya came to meet me. She said, “Mr. Siddiqui, I know on the basis of your findings I have lost my job but believe me, I have no grudge against you – you were honest enough never to give me false hope or make any false promise to me. But I do not understand that guy who gave me such a big assurance of protection and the very next moment issued my dismissal orders under his own signature. I will not leave that guy alone.” Before I could say anything, she left. Later I heard that she had created a nasty scene in the Director’s chamber abusing him of using indecent language.</p>
		<p>What happened? My honest ‘No’ was honoured by Maya but my boss had to pay a heavy price for his dishonest ‘Yes’.</p>
		<p>Saying ‘No’ is an art and sometimes it becomes necessary to say it. Recognize that you have the right to say ‘No’ when it comes to commitment which you apprehend to fulfil. But never say ‘No’ bluntly. Saying ‘No’ is an art. There are many ways to say ‘No’. Instead of saying to someone, “I do not agree with you.” you can say, “I have a different view.”</p>
		<p>The Chocolate-cream bosses are least assertive – they follow the famous Hindi phrase ‘<em>chalta hai’</em>’. ‘Don’t be assertive’ is the first principle that a Chocolate-cream manager religiously follows. In a review discussion, while evaluating the performance of a high-flier, one such Chocolate-cream boss advised the high-flier not to be assertive. “You are a bit assertive – that’s the only negative trait I find in you,” said the boss. What he indirectly suggested was that the high-flier should not to make any waves in the organization. “Never try to hit the headlines in the organization – always be moderate” is another piece of advice that came to another high-flier.</p>
		<p>Manual J Smith, in his best seller on assertive training ‘When I say No, I Feel Guilty’, unmasks such managers who treat assertiveness as a sin. “Our assertive rights are a basic framework for each individual’s healthy participation in any human relationship” is his strong belief. Asserting one’s views makes one think and I believe that being assertive means being confident of one’s self and in one’s abilities – “No matter what happens to me, I can cope with it.”</p>
		<p>Managers must strive to develop assertive skills, boldness and fairness. Sobriety is the prerequisite for assertive skills and demonstration of courageous gestures. The phrase ‘Be fair and firm’ is no more valid unless it is suffixed with the word ‘friendly’. ‘Be fair, firm and friendly’ is the complete message.</p>
		<p><strong>A few tips</strong></p>
		<p>I offer a few tips to ‘Raj-type bosses’ on ‘how to get rid of the Chocolate-cream syndrome’:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><em>Never allow personal insecurities to blur your vision</em> – Personal insecurity prompts us to invent rules to control the behaviour of others. I recall that a decade ago, when we were formulating the Personnel Manual for one of the premier companies, my senior colleague got wild when I suggested making the rules simpler- avoiding legal jargon, provisions savings clauses etc. Later on, while sharing the secret of his success, he counselled me. “Never commit such a blunder,” he whispered. “If the personnel policies are made too simple, who will bother about you and me? Make them as complicated as possible if you want to be worshipped by the technocrats.” His message was quite clear – the more complicated the rules, the better your hold on others. Those who feel professionally insecure will single-handedly try to complicate matters by creating a Gordian knot here and there with an ulterior motive in mind.</li>
		<li><em>Avoid offering justifications to buttress your actions</em> – When a child makes a mistake he immediately offers justification in support of his action. No such explanations are required in management affairs for the simple reason that they do not add any value to the product or customer. On the contrary, by demanding such justification from subordinates, quite often the boss will simply create ‘lame ducks’ in the organization.</li>
		<li><em>Finding solutions to other people’s problems is your problem too– On most occasions we withdraw ourselves on the alibi that ‘it is his (sub-ordinate’s) personal problem and I don’t want to invade on his private self ’. On the contrary, when it comes to pleasing someone, we do not hesitate in ‘yessing’ and agreeing to most of his thoughts and views, which our inner soul registers as ‘just stupid’. Turning a Nelson’s eye to the problems of your people is regressing to the Stone Age – never forget this. Resolve their problems to keep them healthy - physically,mentally and spiritually. When the soul suffers, the body cannot be productive. By taking care of the soul of your people, you can humanize the organization.</em></li>
		<li><em>Be flexible</em> – Changing your mind is not being sinful. There is nothing like a perfect solution. Sometimes we are required to try this or that. Rigidity in approach would simply lead to a disaster. In life we face uncertainties – these can be faced and resolved only with flexibility and not with rigidity. There is nothing like the <em>Thakur ki zubaan</em> (the rigid spoken words of a <em>Thakur</em> which cannot be altered) for achieving success in our day-to-day life. It is better to try alternative solutions than to rigidly stick to a decision. You can then even better the best.</li>
		<li><em>Making mistakes is a natural phenomenon of learning</em> – Those who do not make mistakes commit only blunders.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When a violent mob wanted to stone to death a sinner woman, Christ allowed them to do so on one ‘simple’ condition – <em>Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. </em></p>
		<p>Each one of us makes mistakes. Making mistakes is natural. Shying away from this fact kills the learning instincts.</p>
		<p>A Chocolate-cream boss is over cautious as he does not want to commit mistakes and suffer failures. “Men learn little from success, but much from failure,” is an Arabic saying. “He who has never failed somewhere, that man cannot be great,” believes Herman Melville. “In a day, when you don’t come across any problem, you can be sure that you are travelling in a wrong path,” says Swami Vivekananda. Albert Einstein’s thoughts are no different when he says, “If someone feels that he had never made a mistake in his life, then it means he had never tried a new thing in his life.”</p>
		<p>A little girl, after a 30-minute struggle on the computer, got the print-out of a big banner for her uncle’s 60th birth anniversary with the spelling ‘Sixteeth’. When everyone started poking fun at her, she coolly and confidently replied, “So what? Mistakes do occur. What is there to laugh about!” Unknowingly she followed the basic principle of creativity: ‘It is better to fail in <em>originality </em>than to succeed in <em>aping’</em>. Creating a banner on the computer was more important than the mis-spelt word that could always be corrected. Such simple logic, so obvious to the little girl, is alien for Chocolate-cream bosses. </p>
		<p>It is always better to commit mistakes and say, “So what!” than to opt for inaction and apprehend, “What if?”</p>
		<ul>
		<li><em>Don’t be shy of saying, “I don’t know”</em> – At the International Resource Development Centre in UK, I asked a simple question to the specialist on Personnel Management who was taking a session on Leadership. “I am sorry – I don’t know,” was the simple answer that came from the specialist without any shred of hesitation. After a week I got a personal letter from her in which she clarified the point to my satisfaction. She also mentioned that she got the solution from one of her colleagues and was happy that my query had given her an opportunity to learn.<p>Not managers but ‘Heroic managers’ have a solution to every problem, which they pick out from their ‘fool’s cap’. </p></li>
		<li><em>It is better to be ‘admired’ than ‘liked’</em> – A Chocolate-cream boss will be loath to empower his people. He does not allow them to develop ‘assertive skills’ lest they use these against him sometime. <p>“Boldness in business is the first, second and third thing” is a precious adage which managers should never forget.</p>
		<p>Sometimes a Chocolate-cream boss avoids taking a stand because he does not want to displease anyone. “I cannot <span>give you the formula of success,” Herbert B Swope once said, while addressing a gathering. “But I can give a formula of failure which is – <em>try to please everyone</em>.” </span></p>
		<p>Joyce Engelson aptly says, “People get so damned frightened if someone threatens not to like them. They get paralyzed and don’t function to their own benefits… You will never be loved if you can’t risk being disliked.”</p></li>
		<li><em>Solutions do not rest always in ‘logical’ decisions</em> – ‘<em>Fair is foul and foul is fair</em>’ wrote Shakespeare. What appears to be most logical can prove to be most stupid.<p>Once a problem was fed into a computer to decide and advise whether to buy a watch that runs late by one second in 24 hours or the one that did not ‘run’ at all! The computer preferred the latter. The logic was simple – the broken watch will show the correct time twice a day, whereas the one that runs late by one second will show the correct time only once in a million days.</p>
		<p>“Not all logical statements are true, nor can our logical reasoning always predict what will happen in every situation… Logic and reasoning generally deal with ‘yes’s’ or ‘no’s’ , ‘black’ or ‘white’, process,” says Smith. “But such dichotomy-based logic doesn’t help much in dealing with the day-to-day situations.”</p></li>
		<li><em>Don’t be shy of saying, “I don’t understand”</em> – “I do not understand my own actions,” wrote St. Paul once. <p>The real greatness lies in admitting, “I don’t understand” rather than going on to prove one’s self to be foolhardy by claiming you understand everything under the Sun and making a vulgar display of brute ignorance. Once, one such I-know-everything person enquired from a boy – “Hey, is this camera for ‘colour photographs’ or ‘black and white’?” He refused to agree when the boy tried to educate him that it was not the camera but the film-roll which would get him the colour or black and white photographs.</p>
		<p>True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life.</p></li>		
		<li><em>Say, “I don’t care at least once.”</em> – I recollect a story that was told to me during my primary school days. <p>Once, an old man and his son were riding on a little pony. When they were passing through a village people said, “Cruel fellows – no mercy for the poor animal!” Hearing this, the boy got down. They travelled to another village. The people here said, “Shameless old man – no mercy for the young boy who is walking.”</p>
		<p>Hearing this, the old man got down and the boy sat on the pony. They reached another village. The people here said, “Shameless young fellow – no courtesy for his old father who is walking.”</p>
		<p>Hearing this, the father and son decided not to ride the pony and walk. When they reached the next village, people said, “Foolish fellows. They have a pony, yet they are walking.” Hearing this, both of them got disgusted and lifted the little pony atop their heads. Now the people laughed and said, “See the mad fellows – they are carrying the pony with their hands.”</p>
		<p>And only then did the old man and the boy say, “To Hell with you – we don’t care.”</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Managers grossly mistake lack of assertiveness with sobriety. One of the fondest beliefs of a Chocolate-cream manager is that he can manage everything successfully by just being pleasant to his people. In this anxiety, he avoids situations that warrant hard or even harsh decisions without even understanding the far-reaching consequences of such avoidance.</p>
		<p>A Chocolate-cream boss is simply paralyzed by his own neurotic fear. Gareth Gardiner, the author of <em>Tough-minded Management,</em> has made some valid observations. “The part of a nice person, that is a healthy and mature adult recognizes that he should take action, and take it now to cope with the poor performance of an employee; but the lingering childhood fear is so strong that it produces complete inaction. Such managerial dilemma creates a kind of organizational schizophrenia, delusion of grandeur, withdrawal, indecisiveness, uncertainty, misunderstanding, phantasm and suspicion everywhere.”</p>
		<p>Once, a very senior <em>displease-not</em> boss offered very convincing logic for worshipping God. “Suppose God doesn’t exist, yet you don’t lose anything by worshipping Him. But if you don’t worship, and God really exists, then…! Isn’t it safer to worship without even knowing whether God exists or not?” More interesting was his logic for not attending the interview for the coveted position of CEO in the same company. “The chances of my selection may be fifty-fifty. But in the case of non-selection, the chances of antagonizing the incoming CEO are hundred per cent. He will never forget that I had contested against him. Then, why get into such a problematic situation where the chances of success are only fifty-fifty and those of getting into trouble cent per cent!”</p>
		<p>While passing through an industrial canteen, another <em>displease-not</em> manager soiled his white suit when an angry worker swung an egg-curry dish out of the window. Unable to control his anger, he shouted, “Who the hell dared to throw the egg-curry dish on me? Why are you hiding? Why don’t you come out and show me your dirty face?” He saw the hefty wrestler-like trade union leader approaching him in a menacing manner.The manager immediately wiped the egg-paste from his coat onto his fingertip and started licking it. “Wow – so tasty!” The manager looked at the union leader and asked, “I was only wondering why you didn’t like it. However, each one of us has a different taste … carry on.” Before the union leader could say anything, the manager hurriedly left the room!</p>
		<p>Manuel J Smith describes this phenomenon nicely in simple words: <em>In certain situations, all of us feel like saying, “When I say ‘No’ I feel guilty, but if I say ‘Yes’ I’ll hate myself.” When you say this to yourself, your real desires are in conflict with your childhood training and you find yourself without cues that would prompt you in coping with this conflict. </em></p>
		<p>In fact, not to say ‘No!’ is not at all the safe option the Chocolate-cream bosses believe it to be. I can quote any number of examples from my own experience where not saying ‘No!’ has caused an unmanageable IR situation. When one such <em>say-not-no</em> HR Chief, who went on saying ‘Yes’ to every request of the union, eventually failed to keep up to his ‘yesses’, he was virtually dragged from his cabin to the glass furnace. He was lucky that some loyal workers came and rescued him.</p>
		<p>Another instance occurred some years ago when we decided to lay-off some employees due to heavy power-cuts. We had two factories at different locations as two different SBUs (Strategic Business Units) and each factory had its own recognized union. I was the Personnel Chief of one of the SBUs. We had held joint discussions and both SBUs had decided to go ahead with the layoff and not withdraw under any pressure unless the power-cuts were lifted by the Electricity Board. We were summoned by the State Minister for Labour. The dialogues with the unions started in his presence, and both the managements were represented by their Personnel Chiefs. I had preferred to say ‘No’ to withdrawing from the lay-off since I was sure that having decided to take the bull by the horns - there was no scope for juggling. I was stormed, ridiculed and branded as an anti-labour Personnel Manager. Somehow my counterpart – the Personnel Chief of the other SBU – decided not to earn the union’s wrath. He promised the Honourable Labour Minister of the State that he would reconsider the decision of the management and inform the union. Next day, as decided, both the factories went in for a lay-off. My operation was painless. But my counterpart in the other factory had to face hell for having made a false promise. He had no option than to call for the police force to maintain law and order. “Not saying ‘No’ was the most unpleasant experience of my life,” he eventually confessed.</p>
		<p>Firing is another unholy task that Chocolate-cream bosses hate to do. They do not want any bloodstains on their ‘snow white’ image. To fire delinquent employees one requires assertive skills, guts and boldness. Only those who have learnt to lean towards dangers and uncomfortable situations can afford to do so. The Chocolate-cream bosses consider this a sin. They do not even make positive efforts to ‘counsel’ or ‘caution’ the employees who indulge in misconduct, unauthorized absenteeism or neglect of work. “Why displease someone and earn a bad image by cautioning or initiating disciplinary proceedings – let someone else do it” is the logic always maintained by these good guys. They search for a bad guy to perform such an unholy task, without their own involvement.</p>
		<p>The HRD principle – <em>never resort to disciplinary action until all corrective measures are adopted first and various counselling techniques are exhausted</em> – is undoubtedly not debatable. But once it has been decided to punish errant employees, the unpleasant and unholy task has to be performed without feeling any professional guilt. The disciplinary action is a sacred tool with the management – as sacred as a surgeon’s knife. When an operation is conducted, pain and blood loss cannot be avoided – it can only be controlled or reduced. In case of gangrene, a part of the body is amputated in order to keep the rest of the body healthy. The same principle applies to an organization as well. To keep it healthy, some of us may have to fire someone sometimes. It is necessary that the Chocolate-cream bosses acquire ‘assertive skills’.</p>
		<p>In total contrast to the Chocolate-cream bosses are the Heroic bosses. Both are the two extreme poles of managerial behaviour – the former is based on managerial avoidance and the latter on managerial over-performance. Both cause decadence – both are responsible for sowing the seeds of decline in management. Who amongst the two is better will depend on one’s choice between the devil and the deep sea.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> The Chocolate-cream bosses have a unique strength – they are very good in building relationships. They are good team builders. They should acquire the wisdom that the purpose of their being is not to build country clubs; building good relationships must eventually get them good performance from their people. They should never develop the feeling of professional guilt while performing the so-called ‘unholy tasks.’ They must learn that the purpose is supreme. Arjuna loved Bhishma. He revered him; yet he shot the arrow for the cause for which he was fighting the battle. Do not ever have a shred of hesitation while using your assertive skills. In the anxiety to be loved by their people they should not get branded to be a jellyfish – the fish that does not have bones. A boss without a strong spinal chord cannot be assertive and cannot get the best from his people. </em></p>
