		<p>Johnny was the Deputy Manager.</p>
		<p>We were sipping coffee in a moderate restaurant when Johnny broached the topic about his future growth. Earlier he was working with me when I was posted in one of the SBUs of the organization as chief of HR functions. Later I was picked up for corporate functions at the corporate office of the company located in Bangalore. Obviously, I was in a better position to help Johnny who was recruited by me. It was the opportune time for Johnny to exploit the relationship. After all ‘relationship’ is considered one of the resources in the corporate way of life. And in the Indian Corporate World, ‘functioning’ relationships do matter – how one cultivates and maintains relations!</p>
		<p>“How do you look at your career plans?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“I want to head HR functions,” he replied, candidly.</p>
		<p>“Which unit?” I inquired. The company had thirty strategic business units spread all over the country, each different in terms of size – small, moderate and big. The range of manpower would vary from 100 to 6000. Johnny suggested one of the big units. It was my first visit from the corporate office to the old place of posting (Hyderabad) and I did not want him to get the feeling that he was talking to his ‘corporate boss’.</p>
		<p>“Even if you are posted there, how can you become HR Chief? There is a Deputy General Manager who is several levels above you,” I said. I wanted to convince him in a subtle manner that this career plan was not right.</p>
		<p>“He is not a professional guy. You may send him back to maintenance.” His quick retort showed that he had done his homework well..</p>
		<p>“And what about the Assistant General Manager? He is a professional guy. He is three levels above your present position, and is an alumnus of one of the premier professional institutes.” I thought this would sober him down. I was grossly mistaken.</p>
		<p>“Don’t bother Sir. You may post me as ‘HR Chief’ for I have the guts to control him,” was Johnny’s quick response. I found the ground quaking under my feet. I could not keep my cool and retorted, “That way you may wish even to control me if the opportunity comes to you…” My caustic remarks had no effect on him. He laughed a harsh laugh. What I could not convey to him modestly was the famous 16th century proverb: “If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.” Anyway, later I posted him to the corporate office to assist me. He was happy for sometime, then jumped the guns looking for ‘superior laps’ to get higher visibility through hobnobbing with the higher-ups.</p>
		<p>Such highly ambitious managers with a ‘larger than life-size professional profile’ are not uncommon in the Corporate World. When such over-ambitious managers grow to be bosses, they become a problem for their subordinates. This Johnny also scaled the ladder of hierarchy and retired as General Manager (HR). He created havoc for his people. I will write about those episodes later.</p>
		<p>First, let us analyse why managers grow into ‘Heroic bosses’! What is their psyche? Why do they over-count themselves? Why do they discount others? These are simple but hard to answer questions.</p>
		<p>I remember that during my childhood days I once went with my friend to buy some chocolates. We bought two tiny toy-shaped chocolates. I still remember I had bought a chocolate-rabbit and my friend took a chocolate-elephant. When we started eating the chocolates, my friend was dismayed to find that though the elephant-shaped chocolate had looked big, it was hollow inside. He was terribly disappointed; I could see the frustration on his face. But he immediately pretended to be jubilant and remarked, “Hey! My chocolate is better than yours. Just see, it has an extra bit of chocolate in it!”</p>
		<p>When a child says, “Hey, my toy is better than yours!” he is in fact adopting a defensive stand by launching an offensive as he is aware that his stuff is inferior. The inner inadequacy makes him overreact to cover the deficiency!</p>
		<p>Children who suffer from an inferiority complex tend to cover their weakness by exaggerating their projections. They pretend to be superior with the complex of ‘mine is better than yours’. Their inferior chocolate-toys tend to haunt them. Since they have learnt the game of offensive defence, they continue to play many such games.</p>
		<p>Tragedy strikes when a child with the life-script of a ‘rebel child’ suffers from the ‘mine is better than yours’ syndrome. These are the children who grow to become Heroic bosses. A Heroic boss tends to be larger than life. He suffers from inner inadequacies and an inferiority complex. To overcome his inner weaknesses he tends to overreact and projects himself like the Greek hero Hercules or the comic-legend, Tarzan. The urge for ‘visibility’ added to the inner inadequacy and inferiority complex stimulates him to exaggerate with false confidence. To my mind, the ‘Heroic psyche’ is the make-up to portray this ‘urge for visibility’ blended with ‘over-confidence’. I will try to explain the Heroic boss’s psyche through a matrix.</p>
		<img src="images/0008.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Many believe that such bosses suffer from a ‘superiority complex’. They, however, will be really surprised to know that there is no word like ‘superiority complex’ in psychology! CG Jung underscores two frequently cited complexes – real or imaginary! The former is commonly known as ‘inferiority complex’. Sigmund Freud named the latter after the myth of Oedipus, designating childhood hostility towards the parent of the same sex and attraction towards the parent of the opposite sex. All these complexes develop during childhood. Likewise Heroic bosses develop eccentric traits during their childhood. The corporate environment just helps nurturing these traits. If the organizational climate is pure and healthy, it also helps curing their peculiar mental psyche.</p>
		<p>The Heroic manager causes incalculable damage to the organization in his anxiety to stretch his arms too far and flex his muscles too frequently to over- demonstrate his professional strengths and potential. When the sea is calm, the guy gets restless. There should be some thrill that keeps him visible all the time! If he is not noticeable, he knows how to become noticeable.</p>
		<p>It is apparent to all that the Heroic managers excel in overreacting and creating a crisis in anxiety so as to have the last word or to gain an upper edge over others, even his own boss! Alec Mackenzie, the author of ‘Time Trap’, has given a masterly tip to such disaster hunters: “Doing nothing is far better than managing situation into a crisis.”</p>
		<p>The Heroic boss always tries to project a self-image which is larger than the assignment or even the organization. He works under the myth that the burden of the organization is on his shoulders alone. The same Johnny had once told me, “The Chairman is on a business trip. The Director will also be away for a couple of days. I want to take a day off but I can’t. Who will take care of …!” This he must be telling to others and repeating it to me totally forgetting that I was very much in the office to fill the void. He also forgot that between him and me there stood a good fleet of professionals.</p>
		<p>The favourite pronoun of a Heroic boss is ‘I’. He never tires of blowing his own trumpet or beating his own drums. He is a team-breaker and a block-maker. He is like a child whose teacher has shown him only two colours – black and white. His approach is one of dichotomy – wrong or right. “Here is one phrase I hate to see on any executive’s evaluation, no matter how talented he may be, and that is – <em>He has trouble getting along with people! </em>To me, that is the kiss of death,” observes Lee Iacocca If an executive cannot get along with people it is largely due to his heroic attitude – the habit of over self-projection for higher visibility in the organization. “If an executive cannot get along with his peers, what good is he to the company?” asks Lacocca. We must not forget that as an executive, his function is to motivate other people. If he cannot do that, he is wrongly placed in that position.</p>
		<p>When masculine muscles are flexed and energy is expended playing such foul games by keeping one’s focus on self-gain, both organization and people suffer as authority lords over leadership. Organizational interest takes a backseat when ego-satisfaction becomes the driving force. An Egocentric boss derives satisfaction from ego-seduction. “The heroic leadership fails to make use of knowledge and competencies for which their subordinates were hired,” write David L Branford and Allan R Cohen in ‘Managing for Excellence’.</p>
		<p>The driving force of a Heroic boss is the halo that comes with the position and not the objectives of the company, let alone the purpose of being regarded as supreme! In ‘Managing for the Future’, Peter F Drucker highlights the finer negative aspects of charisma which charms most of us, especially those who suffer from the Heroic syndrome. “History knows no more charismatic leaders than this century’s triad of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao – the mis-leaders who inflicted as much evil and suffering on humanity as have ever been recorded.” Likewise, Saddam of Iraq and Gaddafi of Libya were very competent leaders with enormous capabilities. But they went astray when they started feeding their ego.</p>
		<p>‘Charisma’ is an addiction. It makes a leader inflexible, convinced of his own infallibility and with the inability to change. This is what happened to Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Saddam and Gaddafi. It is common knowledge, in the study of ancient history, that only Alexander’s early death saved him from becoming a hopeless failure. The greed for charisma arises out of the need for visibility and this makes these people overreact.</p>
		<p>An undisputable reality is that an Ineffective manager mostly attracts the management’s concern while the disservice of Heroic bosses often goes unnoticed without concern. They sow the seeds of decline in the organization. Unfortunately, most often, persons in authority are seen with a halo of ego surrounding their heads. They, in fact, suffer from an inferiority complex. This I will say, again and again, until my tongue bleeds.</p>
		<p>Greed for visibility! Yes, this greed is worse than the greed for money.</p>
		<p>After working in five public sector undertakings, I joined my first private sector company. I thought the latter was going to be a model of excellence as I was always made to believe that people from public sector are ‘inefficient’. They are corporate pharaohs and corporate bureaucrats. So, suffering from an inferiority complex, I made a very shaky and unconfident beginning in the new private limited company. Later, I realized that even the superannuated techniques of public sector organizations were Latin and Greek to the so-called smart private sector top bosses. When I decided to use the technique of ‘crashed airplane’ in this so-called ‘world-class’ value-based company – the technique that was used by Reginald H Jones, the former CEO of GE (1972-81) for identifying the most deserving and acceptable internal candidate to succeed him – the heavens caved in and the news spread like wild fire. Unlike Reginald, I used this technique for locating the ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’ of my people in the HR team. Yes, identifying the crown prince was also on the back of my mind.</p>
		<p>I called each manager of my team and began the way Reginald did. “Look we are travelling together and the plane crashes. Now you and I are dead but our concern about the HR Department is still alive. So take this sheet of paper and write down the strengths and weaknesses of each guy in the HR team. Also mention one or two specific dominating traits of each of your colleagues. Finally, suggest who should take over when I am not there. Don’t bother about seniority; just suggest a name according to the individual’s competence.” When some persons suggested his or her own name I used the same words of the inventor of this technique. “See, you and I are dead persons. A ghost cannot take over from another dead man!” Once this was made clear, their thinking pattern shifted onto a different track. You can appreciate a photo only when you do not see your face in the group picture. When anyone appeared to be apprehensive, I would create confidence about the secrecy of the information by saying humorously, “Look you are sharing the secret with the ghost. The dead can’t reveal secrecy!” In the same breath I would add, “Yes, never ever reveal your secrets even to the leaves for the winds will carry it and reveal to the forest.” I added value to the ‘crashed airplane’ technique and made it more effective for multi-purpose corporate use. I had used this once earlier and it did work well. By evening, the real profile of each team member was with me. I used the adjective ‘real’ because no one, except the colleague, knows better about the person. I kept to my promise of secrecy and I will not reveal the outcome even today. What I am going to share is an overall depiction of the actual situation without revealing the real names of the participants in the ‘airplane’ study.</p>
		<p>To my great surprise, almost everyone wrote about Harish; apparently his appetite for ‘visibility’ was very high. He had positive traits - high level of energy as well as potential to grow. Everyone rated him very highly and regarded him to be the crown prince for succession. But the singular trait - abnormal urge for ‘visibility’was quite disappointing for me. One fact that came to the surface was his habit of denouncing the ones who were neck-to-neck with him in the race for competence. Harish emerged out as truly Heroic. When I observed him more carefully, I found lots of matching traits with Johnny though Harish had a higher degree of sophistication and a better ‘wrap up’ – a well-known common trait in the private sector. He emerged to be a team-breaker, always flexing his muscles to create some crisis in the Department. He was highly conscious of his intellectual impulses and logical pursuits.</p>
		<p>I found that he was badly suffering from ‘Egotism’ and the syndrome, what I call, ‘arrogance of intelligence’.</p>
		<p>For ‘kicking colleagues’ one more name came to the surface. It was Tushar. His exterior was very graceful, garnished with sophistication and refinement. After observing his behaviour carefully, I discovered that he was a tale-teller and a back-biter. He could be called a schemer but the guy certainly did not have the heroic muscles to flex.</p>
		<p>At this point, I will deviate slightly from the ‘Heroic’ profile to cover something relating to systems which is without a doubt contextual.</p>
		<p>In this organization, my prime responsibility or rather the ‘purpose of my being’ an Executive Vice President of Human Potential Development was to strengthen the ‘value-based’ foundation laid down by the founder. This I could have done only with the help of a team with inherent real values. But what my ‘crashed airplane’ technique revealed (I later discovered this myself) was that in my own team a few guys did not have any faith in values. They were found playing games with each other to gain personal favors by climbing over others’ shoulders or even pushing them down and climbing over their bodies. What surprised me the most was that they were nice, intelligent, highly qualified and polished guys. Each of them was professionally competent and had good potential to grow. There was enough space where each of them could have found his career-path to gain heights without kicking down the others. I observed that they were afraid and apprehensive of the others’ talents. Their competencies were taken as a threat rather than strength for the HR team!</p>
		<p>It did not take much time to discover the root-cause. detected that the real ‘culprit’ was the <em>performance management system</em>, what they used to call ‘PMS’. It was linked to incentive and career growth. The amount of incentive that the ‘Excellent’ senior Manager could get through PMS was as high as Rupees 200,000! The lowest slab was too low. The gap between the highest slab and the next lower slab was also quite wide. The scheme had a ‘rider’; ‘in each function-group there cannot be rated more than 5 % as high performer’. So if all the twenty guys were excellent, only one would reach the highest slab. Since the gap between the highest and the next lower slab was substantial, the guy who was competing neck-to-neck in the rat race had no option but to win ‘by hook or by crook’. And when one cannot win ‘by hook’, he becomes ‘crooked’ to win. This is what the ‘phrase’ stands for! Why blame the guys? Blame the system.</p>
		<p>This deviation is relevant to underscore the point that it is not the psyche make-up alone that makes one what he Is. The organizational culture and systems also play a major part in moulding a person’s character.</p>
		<p>Systems help cultivate environment. In a healthy environment efficient systems are created and even when the systems suffer from deficiencies, the environment prevents the second law of thermodynamics from causing cultural entropy. Organizational culture is of extreme relevance. Good people create good culture. If the organizational culture is ‘good’, people in the organization grow with values, virtue and wisdom. It works both ways. We allow our managers to grow like Johnny and when they become a threat to the organization we are astonished as we believe that the organization never allows values to deteriorate.</p>
		<p>To make clear what I want to say, I will tell you a story. I call the hero-child of this story ‘Johnny’ as this name has become some sort of a metaphor in the organization where the real Johnny is on the rolls of the company. ‘Johnny’ as a management metaphor is also popular in some of the academic institutions that have of late been using Johnny’s case study for ‘role play’ during corporate training programs.</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was six, he was with his father when they were caught speeding. His father handed the officer a twenty-dollar bill with his driver’s license. “It’s OK, son,” his father said, as they drove off. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was eight, he was present at a family council presided over by Uncle George on the surest means to save points off the income tax returns. “It’s OK, kid,” his uncle said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was nine, his mother took him to his first movie. The box office man could not find any empty seats until his mother discovered an extra $ 5 in her purse. “It’s OK son,” she said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was fifteen, he was made right guard on the high school football team. His coach showed him how to block and at the same time grab the opposing end by the shirt so the official could not see it. “It’s OK, kid,” the coach said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was sixteen, he took his first summer job at the supermarket. His assignment was to put the overripe strawberries at the bottom of the boxes and the good ones on the top where they would be seen. “It’s OK, kid,” the manager said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was eighteen, Johnny and a neighbor applied for college scholarship. Johnny was a marginal student. His neighbor was in the upper three per cent of his class, but he could not play right guard. Johnny got the scholarship. “It’s OK, son,” his parents said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When Johnny was nineteen, he was approached by a senior class student who offered him the test answers for $ 50. “It’s OK, kid,” he said. “Everybody does it.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">Johnny was caught and sent home in disgrace. “How could you do this to your mother and me?” his father said. “You never learned anything like this at home.” His aunt and uncle were also shocked.</p>
		<p>Let us analyze this situation. When was it the first time that the <em>wrong</em> message was recorded as the <em>right</em> approach in the tender brain of Johnny? It was when his father was caught speeding and he handed the traffic police officer a twenty-dollar bill with his driver’s license. And when Johnny looked at his father in surprise, the little boy was consoled by his father, saying, “It’s OK, son. Everybody does it.” The innocent child took his father’s action as the way of life. Why should we then blame Johnny?</p>
		<p>Had Johnny been born in today’s Singapore, his lifescript would have been quite different! Perhaps he would have grown up as a ‘Management Monk’ instead of a ‘Management Monster’. No one dares in Singapore to do as Johnny’s father did. A few years back, I was on a social visit to Singapore – the intelligent island. In the morning newspaper I found a bold heading that attracted me. The news on the first page carried an interesting story of a Malaysian driver who tried to bribe a traffic police inspector. When the driver was caught violating traffic rules he attempted to bribe the traffic inspector. The traffic inspector took this as a grave offence and put the driver behind the bars - not for violating traffic rules but for his attempt to corrupt Singapore culture.</p>
		<p>Now I turn to our real Johnny, with flesh and bones. Johnny was not as Heroic as his bosses and organizational culture made him to be. No doubt, he was having a high appetite for visibility right from day one and for this, he used to overreact with unreasonable high confidence. When he came into contact with one of the Vigilance guys he learnt the trick most of the police fellows do - he found the ‘game of trapping’ so wonderful that within a short duration of time he attained high visibility and gained recognition as a corporate bloodhound. He learned the simple trick for gaining high visibility. If someone tried to flex his muscle, all Johnny had to do was to find out some weakness in that person and then write an anonymous letter against him to the CEO and send a copy to the Vigilance Department. In the Indian public sector companies, managers are highly scared of two guys - Vigilance and Government Audit! When these guys fail in catching the sharks they are content netting in some shrimps. After all the game is of numbers – how many cases have you booked? In alliance with Johnny they could make their score and Johnny could feed his hunger for visibility.</p>
		<p>As if this was not enough, Johnny later got the patronage of one senior officer who was on the verge of retirement. To have a cushy job he (mis)used Johnny as his muscleman. If anybody talked ill about him, his hatchet man, Johnny, used to settle scores for him. This way Johnny became some sort of corporate vampire who used to get sadistic pleasure in chopping off heads by framing vigilance cases and initiating disciplinary enquiries.</p>
		<p>When a virtuous lady compromises with her virtues or the fence falls, everyone tries to to take advantage of the situation. Likewise, when Johnny lost his corporate virtue and was recognized as a muscleman, those corrupt corporate pharaohs who were keen to make a fortune out of his ‘skills’ welcomed him. Once he lost face, he preferred to be a partner of the corporate underworld; people who were crooked and dishonest to the core. Biting others became his habit. Some people started comparing Johnny with a mad dog for good guys were afraid to be seen anywhere near to him.</p>
		<p>A scorpion once requested a tortoise to help him cross the river by carrying him on his back. Since the tortoise was reluctant, the scorpion promised that he would not sting him. The tortoise decided to oblige him. When the tortoise was mid-stream, he felt a terrible pain – obviously it was from the scorpion’s sting. While both were drowning, the tortoise asked the scorpion why he had stung him after promising not to do it and knowing fully well that by doing so both would drown. “I knew, we would but what could I do? Stinging is my habit and habits die hard!”</p>
		<p>With this as the background, I analyse the psyche makeup of a Heroic boss. First let me try to explain this in terms of life positions.</p>
		<p><strong>Life Positions Pattern</strong></p>
		<p>Johnny falls within the life-position known as ‘I’m OK; you’re not OK’. When a person over-counts his own self and under-counts others, he gets into this position. His head swells with false pride. He becomes arrogant. ‘Arrogance gives one more visibility than humility does’ is common knowledge. The so-called successes get into his head and failures settle in the heart causing heartache.</p>
		<p><span>It is believed that this ‘life position’ is the reflection of a battered childhood experience. A child who is brutalized long enough by the parents will grow with the life position – I’m OK; you’re not OK. The story of ‘David Copperfield’ is a unique example of a battered childhood experience. Unusual and uncommon phenomena known as ‘self-stroking’ prevents the child from growing with the life position – I’m OK; you’re not OK. The ‘self-stroking’lifting one’s spirit through<em> self-approval</em> - prevents the child from growing with such an abnormal psyche. In the absence of such ‘self-stroking’, the child who has experienced painful injuries, such </span>as those inflicted on a ‘battered child’, often grows up to be a sadist. Anyone who has suffered a broken bone or massive bruises knows the pain. Common in battered children are extremely painful injuries such as broken ribs, fractured skulls, cuts, burns, fractured bones, internal injuries, and psychological effect of mental torture. Every hour, several hundred children in Indian villages and down trodden societies receive injuries of this kind at the hands of their parents, uncles and aunts and schoolmasters. How then they can be prevented from growing up like a Johnny?</p>
		<p>If the child is blessed with ‘self-stroking’ and he knows how to lick his wounds, he can heal himself and most likely will not grow as a blood-sucking monster. Such a little person has experienced brutality but he has also experienced survival without exchanging it with cruelty. What has happened can happen again. “I did survive,” he says and restores confidence in himself and others. “I will survive,” he asserts and proceeds forward. He refuses to give up. He also refuses to accept that ‘what happened to him he should do to others’. He does not choose this as the solution for his battered childhood.</p>
		<p>But if such a self-healing does not take place, such a child in all probability will turn out to be a Johnny. As he grows older he begins to strike back. He has seen toughness and knows how to be tough. He has also seen hatred and knows how to mete out hatred to others. Hatred sustains him although he may learn to conceal it with a false mask of graciousness.</p>
		<p>Do not get astonished! My discrete enquiries about Johnny’s childhood revealed that he did not have pleasant early days. He belonged to a poor fisherman’s family. He and his siblings had gone through bad periods of starvation during their childhood. He and his family members were looked down upon in the primitive village-society where being born in a low-caste family was considered a social crime and a religious sin. Added to this, a heart-breaking incident had shattered his psyche. A mad dog bit his brother and the boy died of rabies. Johnny had seen his brother suffering from hydrophobia and dying slowly, bit by bit, in a cage. It was such a pathetic and pitiable situation that his subconscious could never disremember it.</p>
		<p>Had there been some noble soul in his proximity during those days, when his life position was taking shape, he would have learnt the art of ‘self-stroking’ and healing his wounds and psychological scars; he would have grown up to be any other person but a Johnny.</p>
		<p><strong>Set of Symptoms</strong></p>
		<p>The prime characteristic being ‘urge for visibility’ coupled with ‘over-confidence’ the Heroic Manager develops certain traits that must be effective in quenching this thirst. I describe some significant characteristics of the Heroic Manager which can also be taken as his symptoms for diagnostic purposes.</p>
		<p><strong>‘I’ is his identity</strong></p>
		<p>A big ‘I’ is his identity. The pronoun ‘We’ does not find any place in his vocabulary.</p>
		<p>I suggest a game that can be played in the classroom or conference hall during a training program or workshop on ‘managerial effectiveness’. Ask each participant to share some of the success and failure experiences as a manager, either in the present organization or at the earlier one. Do not make known the fact that mentally you will be counting the pronoun ‘I’ in his or her statement. This will give you some idea about one’s ‘I’ syndrome. Then, pick up the guy with maximum ‘I’ and the one with the least ‘I’. Ask these two guys to come to the centre of the classroom and converse on any topic. The rule of the game is simple: once one of the two uses the pronoun ‘I’ in any context he loses the game. Both should converse in a normal manner. They cannot take time to weigh their words or pause while talking. You conduct this conversational exercise with two or three couples, one by one, and you will find that those whom you identified for using ‘I’ more frequently lose the game each time.</p>
		<p><strong>Mine is better than yours</strong></p>
		<p>As mentioned earlier, when a child says, “Hey, my toy is better than yours!” he understands that his toy is inferior. Before anybody can point out this obvious fact, he uses this phrase to launch some sort of ‘defensive action’. The Heroic managers are mostly defensive, always defending their actions and choices.</p>
		<p>When Johnny bought a twenty-year-old Fiat car he started justifying the deal to everybody – how he had made such a ‘good buy’! Whenever the old car used to halt on the road, due to an engine problem, he would blame the service stations for not carrying out proper repairs or for selling adulterated petrol. Sometimes he would blame dust in the city insisting that it chokes the carburetor. In the same breath he would appreciate the English engine and its components little realizing that it was an Italian product. My toy is always better than the others!</p>
		<p>It was only when he could afford a new Suzuki, he blamed the old Fiat.</p>
		<p><strong>Highly Egoistic</strong></p>
		<p>Only those who suffer inner inadequacies behave larger than life. Heroic boss has a big ego. A big ego has sharp angles and corners that stick out everywhere. You cannot get near such a person without getting hurt. Yet it is very easy to manage such fellows with a big ego. Someone will simply butter his ‘royal slice of toast’ and outsmart the too smart Heroic boss! His urge for visibility is so high that he becomes myopic and fails to make a distinction between praise and appeasement. It is fine so long as people see him standing tall.</p>
		<h3>Buttering the royal slice of toast </h3>
		<p>Johnny has a coarse voice. To flatter him, his people started praising his voice. They fooled him so seriously that the guy once insisted in the church that he would lead chorus-hymns in the Sunday prayers. The other incident of his clowning that I can hardly forget was about his claim that he was a good athlete and a champion! During the inter-unit sports meet of the company he participated in the ‘High Jump’ event. He chose to make a big start by running almost twenty yards or so, and when he approached the poles he simply went under the crossbar instead of jumping over it!</p>
		<p><strong>Highly ambitious </strong></p>
		<p>Heroic bosses are highly ambitious. Their ambition is a mismatch to their competence. They want to grow or succeed largely for gaining more visibility and to prove their competence. Those who are really competent need not prove anything to anybody. As Lao Tzu says, “Great people never compete.” When you compete you meet ‘competition’. People of excellence operate from a higher plane and always stay par excellence. As they do not compete with anyone, no one competes with them. They meet no competition.</p>
		<p><strong>Overconfident </strong></p>
		<p>It is the urge of visibility that makes the Heroic managers behave overconfidently.</p>
		<p>Once, Johnny came to our place with his family. My wife, two kids and I were taking evening tea in the courtyard. There was a coconut grove and other fruit plants in the courtyard. Johnny asked us why we did not we get the coconuts plucked. Then he immediately asserted that he could do it. He claimed that as he came from the State where coconut trees are grown in every courtyard, he was an expert in doing so. He shared with us the fact that during childhood he used to pluck fruits by climbing up trees much higher and straighter than the ones I had in my courtyard. Despite our preventing him, he started clambering up the tree. When he had reached more than two-third the height, he lost stamina and we could see him gasping. He was profusely sweating and his eyeballs were virtually popping out just like what we see in the Tom and Jerry animation cartoons. We did not know what to do! My son, Feroz, and little daughter, Fairy, rushed and brought a bed sheet asking us to stretch it out so that if he fell down we could provide some protection. No exaggeration, it’s a true tale!</p>
		<p>As a management guy, I shouted out a loud appreciation to boost his morale. I asked him to hold the trunk and rest for a while, and then slowly come down. I told him that he could go up and pluck not one but all the coconuts but I did not wanted them just now. After sometime the drama came to an end when the guy managed to climb down unhurt. He said, “I have climbed down because you asked me not to pluck the coconuts.” Even in such defeatist situation he still held his tail up!</p>
		<p><strong>Over-counting self, under-counting others</strong></p>
		<p>I still remember the first lesson of HRD that was taught to me more than thirty years ago – ‘Never discount self; never discount others.’ Much later I understood it fully and could relate it to the ‘life position’: ‘I’m OK; you’re OK’. But the Heroic bosses always over-count themselves and under-count others. They are the guys who will teach the fish to swim and the eagles to fly!</p>
		<p>The HRD team had evolved a new policy for medical assistance to employees and their families. I insisted that it should be discussed threadbare with the medical guys before it was introduced even on a ‘dry-run’ basis. Johnny called the meeting with a lot of hesitation. Being the chief architect, he did not want the draft to be discussed with the medical officers as he was convinced they would understand nothing about the company’s policy. However, under pressure, he finally called for the meeting. It was disgusting watching Johnny teaching medical science to the medical officers. When subtle signals could not stop him I had to be harsh with him. I still feel sorry for doing this for it was not a nice gesture on my part.</p>
		<p><strong>Disaster Hunters</strong></p>
		<p>Heroic bosses are disaster hunters. They feel uncomfortable when there is no crisis. Managing or mismanaging crisis provides enormous visibility to such heroes. If the crisis was not there, they would create one.</p>
		<p>Once at a post business session, an HRD colleague of mine confided that first he used to create a situation and allow it to aggravate and then intervene to resolve the problem only when his boss would look at him for help. He spoke softly, “I’m then taken as a Messiah!”</p>
		<p>What will one call this? ‘Self seduction’! Perhaps yes.</p>
		<p><strong>Team destructor</strong></p>
		<p>The Heroic managers who grow to be Heroic bosses are not team-builders. They are team destructors. Team does not get any one individual mileage. The Heroic manager as well as Heroic boss strives for individual mileage to get visibility. As a team member, he finds his self is totally lost.</p>
		<p>Both Johnny and Harish (who later grew to be horrible bosses) used to plead that no time be wasted in team building for teamwork does zero good. I agree that if team building is favoured for averaging out performance, then such critical views against team performance make some sense. One can always maintain the average body temperature by putting one’s head in the oven and the legs in the freezer! This example is stupid but it makes the management phenomenon simple and understandable.</p>
		<p>Averaging the team performance will not work anymore. “We began this century with companies doing their level best to suppress differences between individuals,” observes Chuck Lucifer, Chief Growth Officer, Booz Allen &#38; Hamilton. “Now we are seeing that the way to improve productivity is to get more out of each individual.”</p>
		<p>Heroic managers, however, have no such arguments. They are against team building itself. They oppose teams for they lose their individual identity and visibility. They harm teams in two ways. Firstly, they dominate others and try to put them off. Secondly, they snatch others’ work by entering into their areas and then try to create redundancy for others. Their failures surface much later; by that time the damage has been already done. When a surgeon makes a mistake, the patient dies on the operation table. When a structural engineer does a mistake, the bridge collapses after a few months. But the blunder of an HRD manager is too costly – by the time one realizes the mistake, the organization is already gone. As each organization has a Johnny in abundance it is no wonder that each organization has started collapsing.</p>
		<p><strong>Hunger for High Visibility </strong></p>
		<p>The prime cause for the makeup of the Heroic manager, and the later Heroic boss, is abnormal hunger for high visibility. I have made this abundantly clear earlier.</p>
		<p>Once Johnny succeeded in getting a General Manager (Finance) sacked. As the story goes, when Johnny tried to act ‘funny’ with him by flexing his heroic muscles as usual, the General Manager (Finance) asked him to get out of his room or else he would throw him out of the window. Johnny could not bear this humiliation as he was insulted in the presence of the charming secretary who could not help smiling. Johnny made a game plan. He made discrete enquiries and discovered some fault that went against the GM (Finance). He joined hands with the Vigilance to get the GM sacked. On the day the termination orders were to be served, the victim was on leave. Johnny took advantage of the situation and got his room sealed. He also posted the termination orders on the corporate notice boards which was not really required. Johnny was seen running in the corridor with the Security and Vigilance fellows making everybody say, ‘Hey – here is the hero!’</p>
		<p>Sometimes in the anxiety to look Heroic the guy engages in buffoonery.</p>
		<p><strong>Healing Prescriptions for Heroic Bosses</strong></p>
		<p>A syndrome is a psychiatric disease and behavioural disorder. A disease is supposed to be cured. A behavioural disorder needs to be corrected and restored. We may call this ‘healing’.</p>
		<p>That who suffer from this disease – a disease that excites them to overreact to gain corporate visibility – can be cured. The behavioural disorder can be restored to normal if sincere efforts are made.</p>
		<p>I suggest two techniques as ‘restorative prescriptions’ to cure the mis-managers suffering from Heroic syndrome.</p>
		<p><strong><span class="num">(1) </span> Creative Aggression</strong></p>
		<p>‘Creative aggression’ is the first healing technique.</p>
		<p>If one cares to diagnose the Heroic syndrome, he will know that the guy has enormous energy. A Heroic manager is the powerhouse of enormous energy ready to burst out. If not used, this energy will find alternative routes for its release or bust the container. One cannot stop the flow of this energy. Yes, one can utilize the energy and consume it for both good and bad effects. The exploiters used Johnny’s explosive energy for negative corporate functions. It could well be utilized for positive functions where the activity could have added commercial value, EVA – economic value addition.</p>
		<p>Let me make this more simple…</p>
		<p>You cannot hit a six without using enormous force if the ball is bowled at a slow pace. ‘Fast paced bowling’ can be utilized for hitting a six but if your bat misses the ball, you will be clean-bowled.</p>
		<p>Life energy is like a cloud full of rainwater – it has to rain. Likewise, human potential has to be tapped. If not tapped for the right cause, the energy will find its own direction. The unguarded missile is always dangerous – it hits the unintended one!</p>
		<p>The Heroic manager is like an unguarded missile. So what is important is <em>how to harness his energy</em> for organizational needs. ‘Creative Aggression’ is one such technique which can be used for exploiting the strengths and energies of a Heroic manager. What is required in effect is to ignite the spark and take the edge off the arrogance and harshness. The overassertive forces, which go against the organizational interests, can be diverted into the mainstream by converting the ‘aggression’ into ‘creative aggression’ just like the fast ball is effortlessly hit through the slips to score a six. The aggressive spark and reactive forces can be made favourable and supportive for the organization.</p>
		<p>In Chinese martial arts, Jujitsu enables one to overcome a physically superior opponent by just using the attacker’s own energy against him. Judo, a Japanese sports created later in 1882, was also based on Jujitsu. Other popular forms – Kung Fu, Karate, and Taekwondo – also emphasize blows with the feet and the side of the hand. Kendo makes use of ‘bamboo swords’ covered with leather. All these forms of martial arts are based on the same principle, i.e. using the attacker’s own energy against him. In other words – the aggression is made creative by making the force favourable.</p>
		<p>This restorative technique, viz. ‘Creative Aggression’, includes a bit of counselling and in extreme cases, psychological therapy. Creating awareness is the best medicine. Let the guy understand that his basic ailment is the unreasonable urge for visibility. All his heroic actions are the result of this syndrome. Since the life position of the Heroic manager is ‘I’m OK, you’re not OK’, in extreme cases, in his normal life such a guy can commit genocide. In corporate life they commit corporate genocide by harassing people; picking holes and then making mountains out of molehills.</p>
		<p>The Heroic managers must be made aware of the fact that trickery succeeds sometimes but it always commits suicide in the end.</p>
		<p>The other healing technique that I would suggest may be called ‘Supportive confrontation’.</p>
		<p><strong><span class="num">(2) </span>Supportive Confrontation </strong></p>
		<p>‘Supportive Confrontation’ is another restorative prescription that can be experimented with to tame the Heroic manager who suffers from the psychiatric disease – egomania. The ‘urge for visibility’ causes egomania. This urge persistently incites the patient to have the last say in every decision to gain a leading edge.</p>
		<p>The technique of ‘Supportive Confrontation’ involves two steps - ‘support’ and ‘confront’. This appears to be a paradox but that is what life all about! Life is a paradox by itself.</p>
		<p>So what you need to do is confront the Heroic manager’s ‘egotism’ and support his ‘intellectual impulses’ and ‘energy’. Thus, his egotism can be strongly confronted by lending latent support to the intellectual part of his total behaviour. This technique is effective only when a unique equilibrium between <em>confrontation </em>and <em>support</em> is maintained. Confront what is wrong and harmful; support what is right and good for the organization.</p>
		<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>In the end, let me make it loud and clear that Heroic managers and Heroic bosses possess certain positive qualities that cannot and should not be discounted.. The organization should make use of the ‘fire in his belly’.. “It is better to be seen as ‘stubborn’ than ‘incompetent’,” believes Peter Block. It is not very difficult to tame a Heroic manager. But, contrarily, it is foolhardy to expect a jellyfish to suddenly have a bone.</p>
		<p>The identification of Heroic managers in any organization is as important as that of a low performer for HRD intervention and behavioural therapy. The former deserves priority over the latter.</p>
		<p>It is not difficult to locate a Heroic manager or a Heroic boss – he is always visible flexing his masculine muscles. Only if we miss the joker in the pack will a Johnny go unnoticed. This can only happen when the camel walks through the eye of a needle!</p>
		<p class="author"><em>Master Tip: Heroic bosses, despite many weaknesses, possess one excellent leadership trait – fire in the belly. If they control their ego and one-upmanship, they can deliver wonderful results. They are not hopeless cases; their seniors should work on them. They have energy; one must know how to use it in the right direction ! </em></p>
