		<p>During my college days, Dr Insaf was a very famous doctor of Bhopal. He used to narrate a story to his medical students about his unique experience during his practical diagnosis test, a part of his post-graduation final examination. To test his diagnostic skill, he was made to diagnose a patient who was so normal in behaviour that he panicked and started sweating with the ticking away of time. He used all his wiles and guiles to induce the patient to come out with his problem. But the man did not relent. Dr Insaf then decided to write down his diagnosis declaring the patient to be a normal person. He was convinced that the examiners had tried to outsmart him by sending a normal person as a patient for diagnosis.</p>
		<p>Dr Insaf nervously took out his cigarette case to take out a cigarette. The patient swiftly jumped out of the bed and picked up his cigarette pack from the side rack. He offered a cigarette to the doctor. The doctor, while taking the cigarette, casually asked him why he was offering him a cigarette from his pack? The patient smiled and the doctor noticed, for the first time, an abnormal wildness in his eyes. The patient said, “Doctor, this is a very special cigarette. Only two persons in the world use this brand– me and the Duke of Edinburgh.” Without giving it a second thought, Dr Insaf wrote down the diagnosis – The patient is suffering from what Freud referred to as ‘Narcissism’.</p>
		<p>As America is the best example of ‘political Narcissism’; there are many CEOs from this very country who suffer from ‘management Narcissism’. They are such acute patients of this disease that they spend millions of the company’s dollars on ‘PR’ to project their ‘I’ image. Unfortunately, we hear and learn only about them through the PR agency which successfully projects them as corporate mavens. Others, who are the real business leaders, remain in anonymity. ‘Business Narcissism’ has become the most accepted pattern not only in America and the other Western countries but also in India. Many CEO’s spend their company’s money to project themselves. They pay money to the press and electronic media to get personal media coverage. In their interviews, they highlight their ‘individual’ contribution. In simple words, they make their audience believe that they are taller than the company.</p>
		<p>The Narcissistic bosses mostly belong to the clan of ‘Heroic bosses’. Due to their ‘narcissism’ they develop the heroic syndrome. It works the other way as well. Since they suffer from ‘heroic’ syndrome they engage ‘PR’ agencies for their projection. Both ‘Narcissism’ and ‘self-deception’ are their survival mechanism. In today’s Corporate World, especially in Corporate America, many CEOs go to PR agencies for their self-projection. In such a rat race, those who do not follow this practice become the losers although they are second to none.</p>
		<p>The term ‘Narcissism’ was introduced in 1887 by Alfred Binet, but its usage today stems from Freud’s essay ‘On Narcissism’ that he wrote in the year 1914. In Greek mythology, Narcissus was a handsome young man who rejected all potential lovers but then tragically fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. The word ‘Narcissist’ came from ‘Narcissus’ – the lovelorn Greek legendary hero.</p>
		<p>To my mind, Narcissists are ‘self centered’ people. How to deal with such self-centered Narcissistic bosses is a serious question. Many ask me during my workshops, ‘How can we survive with a boss who has an EGO taller than the Khalifa Tower of Dubai?”</p>
		<p>The answer is not simple. I ask certain investigatory questions about their bosses: Is your boss, he or she, fond of using ‘I’ more often than the pronoun ‘We’? Is he or she very conscious of his or her looks, dress and whole appearance? Does he or she consistently exhibit immoral and unethical behavior to project his or her own image? Does he or she delight in another’s misery? Does he or she, with very little effort, manipulate situations? Does he or she frequently change opinions or doctrines, i.e. do a ‘flip-flop’? If the answer is ‘Yes!’ to any of these questions about the behavior of the boss, then my answer is, “Yes! You have a Narcissistic boss.”</p>
		<p>These bosses are unpleasant to deal with and do not value their subordinates. If you can handle this and furthermore, are willing to play their game and supply them with what they crave, great! You will have no issue with them. Do not complain; do not expect them to act normally, ethically or soberly. If you can reconcile with their bad behavior, minimize your participation and make use them – they will prove to be good tools. Play the game by always saying, ‘Wow!’ in response to their over-projection. If you play this game, play it cleverly so that you boss is not aware of your game-plan. Even if they finally do understand what you are up to, they will not mind as they feel happy in being pleased. This is a very simple technique adopted by many people while dealing with ‘Narcissistic bosses’.</p>
		<p>The other way to tackle such bosses is to stand firm and give them the feeling that you are <em>not interested</em>! Be business-like. Listen to them but while giving an answer, keep focus on the issue and ignore the rest as if you have not heard anything. Believe me, they will become more polite to you; not immediately but certainly after having a few trial discussions with you.</p>
		<p>If your self-respect and dignity are too dear to you, it is better to distance yourself from these bosses. But in the same breath I will add that you cannot run away from them. We are human beings, and each one of us suffers from a ‘Narcissistic syndrome’ – it is simply a question of the degree of narcissism.</p>
		<p><strong>Tips to Narcissistic Bosses</strong></p>
		<p>I would suggest that the Narcissistic Bosses must read the Panchatantra – the masterpiece work of the great Hindu scholar, Pandit Vishnu Sharma. There are many stories which will sober them down. I quote one of these stories which is relevant here. </p>
		<p>Once there lived a tortoise in a large pool. He had made friends with two swans. The three friends loved one another very much. The swans daily came to the tank. After having a hearty swim they would perch on a rock on the bank of the pool. The tortoise would also come there and sit on the rock. All the three would sit and chat for hours happily. This went on for a number of years.</p>
		<p>Now, one year it so happened that there was a long drought. The rains failed and there were no good crops. As a result, a famine broke out. Men, women, children and animals died in large numbers. Birds also flew to safer regions where it had rained in plenty. So the swans also decided to leave the area and go somewhere else. They were worried about their dear friend, the tortoise. What would he do?</p>
		<p>The tortoise also felt worried. At the same time, he felt extremely pleased at the love his friends had for him. He said, in a voice choked with emotion, “Friends! I am really grateful to you for your concern about my future. But what is to be, must be. Who can go against His will? You must fly to some safe place. My best wishes are with you.” The swans wept to hear the words of the tortoise. They said, ‘No, we must do something to help you. It is our duty as your true friends. If we do not stand by you at this dark hour, we would not be able to pardon ourselves.”</p>
		<p>So, the swans thought hard and at last hit upon a workable plan. They decided that they would look for a strong stick that could bear the weight of the tortoise. The tortoise was to hold the middle of the stick in his mouth. The swans would hold each end in their beaks. Then they would fly in the sky slowly, carrying the tortoise with them.</p>
		<p>When the swans told the tortoise about their plan, he became too joyous. He thanked his friends once again for their anxiety about his safety.</p>
		<p>“But there is a serious danger too,” said one of the swans.</p>
		<p>“What is that? Let me know,” said the tortoise.</p>
		<p>“If by chance you try to speak, you are sure to fall down and be killed,” explained the swan.</p>
		<p>“Why should I be that foolish? I shall, in no case, utter a word as long as we are flying high up in the sky. Nor shall I open my mouth for any reason,” said the tortoise, in a reassuring tone. So, the swans brought a strong stick. The tortoise held it tightly in his mouth while each swan held one end of the stick in its beak. Before taking off, the swans reminded the tortoise once again that he was not to open his mouth at all. Up went the three friends as the swans slowly took off from the bank of the pool. Soon they reached the higher layers of the air. They flew over fields, hills and forests. All the three friends were very happy that their plan was working well.</p>
		<p>During the course of their flight, the three friends flew over a village. The children of the village were playing outside it. One child happened to look up and saw the strange sight in the sky. He told his mates about it and all of them looked up. The children had never seen anything like that before. They clapped their hands shouting at the top of their voices, “Look! Look! Two birds are carrying a tortoise by means of a stick. What a wonderful sight!”</p>
		<p>The shouts of the children made the tortoise uneasy. He was annoyed. “Why are these foolish guys only appreciating my friends and not me?” thought the tortoise, “I am firmly holding the stick and taking a great risk with my life!” Lost in these thoughts, the tortoise forgot all about the danger that would be there if he opened his mouth. The more the children shouted appreciating the swans, the more upset the tortoise felt. Eventually he could not control his anger and shouted, “Oh! You foolish fellows, appreciate my courage and skills as well…”</p>
		<p>As soon as the tortoise opened his mouth to speak, his hold on the stick was lost. Down he came, tumbling through the air from a great height. The tortoise fell down on the ground with a loud thud. As a result he died. He died just to hear a few words of appreciation.</p>
		<p>Many managers and many bosses would die to hear a few words of appreciation.</p>
		<p>‘Self appreciation’ is a human weakness. It is harmless to others. It harms the one who suffers with this syndrome – Narcissism!</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Believe me, Narcissistic Bosses are harmless creatures – their only hunger is ‘Praise’. If you cannot feed them, at least hear what he or she says. What do you lose if you hear patiently the same story of your boss’s achievement one hundred times? As a boss, he surely enjoys this much right over you! </em></p>
