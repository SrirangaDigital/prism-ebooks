		<p>Now I share some of my experiences in the private sector organization. At the later part of my career, I quit my board level position in a public sector company of Bangalore and joined a private sector company where I had to build and develop values in employees. I was told it was a value-based company. Yes, it was! The founder was a noble soul, and so was his descendant, the Managing Director. The purpose of my being in the company was to preserve the core values and stimulate the corporate soul. At the corporate level we had nine jewels – the top team. I was also a part of this ‘Navaratna’. The outside image of the company was that it was a ‘Star company’. The insiders used to say, “It is a company of ‘Stars’.” Both connotations seem to be phonetic and poetic yet they give quite the opposite meaning.</p>
		<p>In this company I found many Heroic managers – who were much more stronger and ruthless muscle-men than Johnny. Corporate hangmen or hatchet men would be a more appropriate word for them. Here I found high profile, sophisticated professional stalwarts standing tall and always wearing a false smile on their face. In fact, they were suffering from the same psychiatric ailment – inner inadequacy.</p>
		<p>Mahadev (not his real name), one of the functional directors of the company, used to consider himself the de-facto Chairman. To build up his Heroic image, he used to follow a wonderful strategy. Through his actions and company’s policies he used to send strong signals to people – <em>please me to prosper; if you displease me, thou shall perish</em>.</p>
		<p>There is so much to share to educate my readers about these crooked corporate bosses, but I am committed to do equal justice with each mis-manager and narrate misadventures relating to their respective ‘sport’. So, I will be sharing my experiences relating to only one or two Crooked Bosses.</p>
		<p>Once, Mahadev and I were finalizing the list to promote junior and middle level executives. I am very cooperative and always give due respect to the Head of the Department’s recommendations for he knows better about the candidate than anyone else. But my humility was taken as my weakness. Mahadev insisted that an accountant, who was not even in the executive cadre, should be promoted to the higher executive position, which was a two-step higher rank. I found that his appraisals were good but that this did not justify granting him a ‘double-jump’ promotion. Such a promotion would create an imbalance in the clearly defined company’s career-growth policy. Mahadev, however, was quite insistent. When discussions became serious, I took a stern position and said a firm, ‘No’. As an Executive Vice President (Human Potential Development), ensuring judicious career growth for everyone within the confines of defined policies was my responsibility.</p>
		<p>“I concede,” he smiled. I thought the issue settled. But when both of us were about to sign details of the proceedings, he asked, “Moid, tell me why you said ‘No’ to my proposal? Do you think the guy I am recommending is not competent?”</p>
		<p>“No, Mahadev. It is not for any reason other than the company’s present policy. If I allow the guy a two-step higher position by overriding the company’s policy on the basis of your recommendations, I don’t know how many such high-fliers I will be de-motivating for they are invisible to my eyes as they don’t have ‘Mahadevs’ as their powerful bosses.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, I see!” His smile was colder than the biting winter wind in the Himalayas. “So, we agree to go as per the system?”</p>
		<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
		<p>“Are you free tomorrow? I want to sit and talk with you for a few minutes,” he said.</p>
		<p>“Yes, tell me at what time?” I enquired.</p>
		<p>“Say, ten in the morning.”</p>
		<p>“OK,” I said. When I was about to leave he asked, “Will you not ask the purpose of our meeting?” He smiled and then laughed. After maintaining the suspense for some time he said, “Tomorrow I shall call the same guy for interview for the post of Deputy Manager and both of us shall select him.” He paused and then clarified, “The guy will resign from the position of accountant and will come as an outside candidate.” I had nothing to say as sometimes it is wiser not to say anything.</p>
		<p>“I hope this will go with the system.” The suggestion was so simple and his voice so humble that using the word ‘caustic’ will be unjust. I thought for a while. Then added the name of the guy in the list and offered the proceedings for his signature. When Mahadev was hell bent to bend the rules to find an escape route that would give a much louder signal than the corporate sin I was going to commit, I thought it wiser not to stretch too much for ‘too little’.</p>
		<p>We signed the proceedings and parted. He waved his hand with a winner’s smile and his body language said, “Good guy… go with me…”</p>
		<p>Later, I understood the reason behind his most unreasonable act – he wanted to send signals about his Heroic presence in the organization - that he was capable of bending the rules of the company if he decided to favour someone. It was he who called the shot!</p>
		<p>Such crooked bosses always build ‘Power Centres’. For building power centres only positive signals are not enough. People must also be terrorized by sending out negative signals – to know what happens if someone opposes such bosses!</p>
		<p>Mahadev was the perfect model of a ‘crooked boss’. There are many stories about his terrorising people giving clear indications that anyone who dared to raise a voice against him would not survive in the organization.</p>
		<p>Now I share another incident where Mahadev tried to send negative signals to make people believe that whosoever dared to raise a voice against him would be hounded in the organization.</p>
		<p>Once KP (not his real name), Managing Director, called me and shared with me the fact that a lady, who was his secretary during his earlier career in the company, was being underutilized. He wanted me to assess her potential and redeploy her. After coming back to my room, I asked my secretary to arrange a meeting with that lady. Her name was Sheela (not the real name). My secretary was shocked and advised me, “Sir, it would be wise not to meet this lady.”</p>
		<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“Sheela is an accursed person… no one talks to her,” she replied, hesitantly.</p>
		<p>“Accursed person!” I was shocked to hear these words. On my insistence, my secretary revealed some secrets to me about this lady after taking my word that I would never disclose her name. She was quite afraid and hesitant to do so. If I not been her boss, she would never have obliged me. It appears that before the death of the founder Chairman, his son, KP, was occupying the position of Manager. Sheela was his secretary. She was a very bold lady. She never liked Mahadev, who was the then General Manager (Finance). She knew that the fellow was a crooked boss and many ladies used to come to her to cry on her shoulder. It appears that Sheela dared to raise her voice against him. Mahadev called her and cautioned her that if she did not stop her ‘silent campaign’ against him she would be punished severely. Since Sheela was also occupying a powerful position – Personal Secretary to the son of the founder Chairman – she never bothered about Mahadev’s threat.</p>
		<p>Mahadev was very cunning. He took advantage of the goodness of the founder Chairman and managed to become head of finance. Now he had all the keys to the company’s finances. After sometime, the founder Chairman passed away. Since KP, who took over as Managing Director of the company after his father’s death, was quite junior to Mahadev and did not know much about company’s finances, he banked heavily upon Mahadev. This way Mahadev became the de-facto Managing Director. KP shifted to the MD’s chamber where the former MD’s senior secretary was already in charge. Sheela remained in the old office as secretary to a Manager and became anchorless. It was time for Mahadev to take revenge. He called her and asked her to sit at a desk in the corner without any work. Soon people came to know that Sheela was in Mahadev’s bad books. People stopped meeting her. She was totally isolated. KP wanted to help her, but he too never wanted to displease Mahadav who was the real controller of the company’s finances. Mahadev played another mischief. He brought his own co-brother and made him in-charge of the ‘Finance subsidiary company’ dealing with financial ventures. Thus, the entire finance of the holding company as well as the subsidiary company came under his control - directly and indirectly.</p>
		<p>When I heard Sheela’s story, I decided to intervene and do something. I asked my secretary to call for Sheela. Next day Sheela came to me. I found she was quite competent. She was very good in communicating with the personnel. I decided to redeploy her in my corporate communication department. She was quite happy, yet nervous.</p>
		<p>“Sir, perhaps you are not aware of my background…,” she told me hesitantly.</p>
		<p>“Not fully,” I replied. She waited for sometime and narrated the entire story. She also mentioned that she had been severely punished – she lost her career. She was also penitent about having used some strong words against a very senior authority. I was fully convinced that it was a very deserving case for ‘rehabilitation’.</p>
		<p>“Look for a new life. The curse is over,” I replied. She broke down. After many years, she had finally found someone speaking to her softly, sympathetically and confidently.</p>
		<p>Later I talked to Sheela’s boss and informed him that I was transferring her and giving him another stenographer. He had no issues. I asked my secretary to prepare the transfer orders of Sheela. She began preparing the transfer orders. My phone buzzed. Normally my secretary lifts the phone but I lifted it. To my great astonishment, Mahadev was on line.</p>
		<p>“Moid, how are you?” His voice was very soft and tone humble. “I am at Delhi…,” he paused and then asked, “I heard you are planning to shift Sheela from her present position?” I thought for a while and said, “Yes, Mahadev.”</p>
		<p>“Moid, you are new to this organization. Many things you do not know. I am coming back tomorrow. I will come to your room to have a nice hot cup of coffee.” He was very cordial and friendly.</p>
		<p>“Sure, “ I reciprocated, in the same friendly tone. “I would love to welcome you. But, Mahadev, I know the story of Sheela. I also know that she used certain words against you which she should have not used. I met her and she has realized her mistake…”</p>
		<p>“Moid, don’t believe her words. She is a crooked lady. I am sure she must have also shed crocodile tears,” replied Mahadev. I was wondering about the fact that he knew everything that had happened inside my room. I did not know what to say next.</p>
		<p>Then I heard him say, “Keep the transfer orders pending till I return.” It seemed like he was issuing an order to me. I dislike people using this tone with me but I kept my cool and tried to convince him once again that her case was a fit case for rehabilitation. He got annoyed and said, “You will not issue the transfer orders.” I lost my cool and retorted, “Mahadev, you are late – her transfers orders have already been issued.” I told a white lie.</p>
		<p>“Then, you should withdraw the orders immediately.”</p>
		<p>“Mahadev, perhaps you are not aware that once I sign the paper it cannot be withdrawn. Even KP cannot withdraw it.” I lost my temper and gave him a hard verbal punch. He, however, was determined to have a last laugh.</p>
		<p>“Moid – <em>agar aap ne zaher peene ka soch hi liya hai tho aap zuroor zaher peeyenge</em>.” He spoke to me in chaste Hindi. Though he was a Tamilian, he spoke good Hindi interspersed with chaste Urdu words. What he told me this time was not mere words but a threat - “If you have decided to drink poison, you shall drink poison.”</p>
		<p>I went ahead with my plans. Sheela reported to the Corporate Communication Chief. Many times I have given her assignments directly and she always lived up to my expectations. She was an asset which was wasted for more than two years.</p>
		<p>Later, Mahadev met me many times but never spoke a single word about that episode. I thought he had given up and preferred to forget it. But I was wrong!</p>
		<p>As an HR guy, I always reflect. I tried to find out the possible causes as to why Mahadev was against me. There could be many reasons but one of the reasons was my entry into the organization</p>
		<p>-I was perhaps the only person inducted into such a senior position without any formal interview. KP, the Managing Director of the company, had chatted with me at an informal meeting and asked me to join the company. I accepted his offer not because of the attractive pay package but because of the founder’s value system. This had created a great deal of suspicion in the mind of Mr. Crooked – <em>Who is this guy who made an entry without any formal interview? </em>The other reason for his considering me his <em>bête noire </em>was my weak predecessor who was too submissive to counter Mahdev’s ego. He never opposed him or said ‘No’ to his commands. Later, I came to know that he was afraid of Mahadev and yielded to his whims and fancies – playing safe to protect his job. As I had mentioned earlier, though Mahadev was only a Director he wielded the clout of a Managing Director. When I got into the saddle, he expected the same ‘spineless’ behaviour from me. When I demonstrated courage and refused to bow down, he was determined to teach me a lesson.</p>
		<p>Now let me reveal to you the result – the final outcome of my tussle with Mahadev.</p>
		<p>Murugan (not his real name), President, Agri-group, was Mahadev’s blind follower. They were always together – the bondage of some ‘common interests’ is always strong.</p>
		<p>Those were the days we were making lots of changes in the corporate structure with the assistance of world-class consulting services. During this ‘<em>parivartan</em>’ time, HBR (Harvard Business Review) came out with an article on a ground-breaking theme, “The Centre-less Organization”. It was a new theme with focus on the extreme degree of ‘decentralization’. This module suited the sector chiefs (business group chiefs) as it further strengthened their autonomy.</p>
		<p>All through my career, I have preached for and practised ‘Empowerment’. I am not against functional ‘autonomy’ but when it comes to overall business strategies, with focus on the larger interests of the company, such autonomy needs to be redefined. The maxim ‘Power corrupts – absolute power corrupts absolutely’ is not all that hollow. To cut the story short, the idea to demolish ‘corporate HR’ was sold by these two corporate Pharaohs through the consulting agency in line with the HBR article. It was not their <span>first attempt; earlier also they had tried to ‘play’ with me but did not succeed. When you throw a lot of spaghetti at the wall, one may stick to it. This last spaghetti stuck well. It was decided by KP to go for a ‘centre-less organizational structure’. Since it could be of an equal threat to some other corporate functional heads, including Corporate Finance, the consulting agency was ‘misused’ to suggest that the implementation process would be carried out in a ‘phased manner’ – Corporate Human Potential Development (HR) became the first casualty. KP (Managing Director) never wanted me to leave. He had many alternative plans for utilizing my services gainfully. But, in principle, respecting the new ‘centreless structure’, I chose to depart. </span></p>
		<p>‘Virtues help some to rise to lofty heights; the same virtues can make the noble fall!’ I left the organization with head held high! The second phase, as I could foresee, never materialized. The so-called ‘Centre-less Organization’, which was planned with a skewed objective, never became the reality.</p>
		<p>After leaving the company, I had a heart-to-heart talk with the son of KP (who is the present MD of the company). I gave him an honest feedback about Mahadev’s policy of terrorizing and demoralizing people. I also gave him evidence. He was fully convinced that Mahadev was not only crooked but also corrupt. He was eating the company’s money like termites eat the wood. He took this up with his father and Mahadev was asked to leave the company. His exit was most disgraceful. By that time, Murugan had also seen that the wind was blowing against both of them. So, he too found another job and quit.</p>
		<p>The drama ended, proving that truth always wins over falsehood.</p>
		<p><strong>Tips for Crooked Bosses</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Trickery works – it works well; not only for some time but for most of the time. But eventually it commits suicide. Duration may vary but the eventual end is predestined. </li>
			<li>The result that one obtains from crooked means can also be obtained from straight transactions. The only difference between the two is that in the latter case you may not get 100% of what you wanted but you will get long term benefits - much more than what you could have achieved through your crookedness. The second benefit of getting results via straight means is that you remain protected from the ‘causations’ – the Universal Law of Energy response which is also known as the ‘Law of Cause and Effect’. </li>
			<li>Just to reveal something more about Mahadev. The story did not end with his losing the job. He joined another famous IT company, misguided the CEO by luring him to invest public money in ‘Real Estate’ and when things went wrong, he and his CEO were put behind the bars. Remember, the only way to control the negative ‘Causal Effects’ is by controlling your ‘Actions’. The causal effect remains active even after the death of a person. Crooked people go to graves troubled by the injustice done by them to others. </li>
			<li>The Crooked Bosses must remember: <em>There is no Right way to do a Wrong thing. </em></li>
			<li>One of the weapons that Crooked Bosses use in their favour is ‘Wrong Propaganda’. They do not realize that most of the crooked fellows become the victim of their own propaganda. </li>
		</ol>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip to the followers:</strong> Learn the technique of ‘Selective Support’. When you receive ‘crooked directives’, make an analysis and decide your own ‘Laxman Rekha’ – the extent through which you can carry out the instructions without bleeding your conscience. Beyond this, raise hands and say, “I cannot do this!” It needs competence to declare yourself incompetent in certain matters. You may suffer but you will not sink. Suffering is better than sinking. </em></p>
