		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">8. </span>Gotcha Bosses</h1>
		<p>Gotcha is an American slang – Got you! It also means – I understand you. But, ‘Gotcha’ is always used as a negative connotation – I got you - meaning I caught you on the wrong foot!</p>
		<p>Many do not know that ‘Gotcha’ is the short form of the game people play in society, popularly known as ‘NIGYSOB’ – Now I’ve got you son of a b…” The last word is so dirty that normally it is not written or spoken.</p>
		<p>During my more than three decades of experience in Corporate India, I found many Gotcha Bosses. Nevertheless, the ‘Gotcha’ trend is decreasing.</p>
		<p>Those who have seen the popular Hindi film ‘Sholay’ can recall the scene where Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) has captured Basanti (Hema Malini) and tied her to a tree on a hillock. Then the cruel dacoit sends the word to Veeru (Dharmendra) to come and surrender; otherwise, he will kill his beloved Basanti. When Veeru gets the message, he reaches the scene riding a horse. When Veeru came to the valley, Gabbar Singh utters the famous dialogue: “<em>Ab aaya oont pahaad ke neeche</em>!” meaning now the camel has come under the cliff (a situation where he can be easily captured). Gotcha means exactly this.</p>
		<p>During my NHPC days, I had a colleague. His name was Thakur. He was an Administrative Manager. He had risen from the ‘rank and file’. Though he was only a Manager, even the Executive Engineers and Superintendent Engineers were afraid of him. No one would ever try to displease Thakur Ji. Why? This was because he was a Gotcha Manager. He knew the art of bringing the camel under the cliff so that it could be easily captured.</p>
		<p>The other Gotcha manager – a perfect profile – was Johnny who has been in the limelight in the chapter Heroic Boss. Once he got annoyed with someone, he would not leave him. Normally, subordinates are afraid of bosses. But in Johnny’s case, the bosses were afraid of him. No one would like to take him with them except those who wanted a bull dog to guard themselves against their own weaknesses by using or misusing him. Yet, in one such case, the dog bit the master!</p>
		<p>Normally, Gotcha Bosses or Gotcha managers will wait and watch the situation so that they can pounce at the right time and make a perfect kill. Johnny would never do that. He would create the ideal situation so articulately that the camel was bound to come under the cliff. Since he was in corporate HR, he had easy access to the personal files of employees -an extremely confidential document. This way he would get to know every personal detail about the person viz. his horizontal and vertical movements in the company, and the good and bad incidents. After making personal investigations about an employee, he would simply write an anonymous letter levelling some charges against him or her. When the letter reached Corporate Vigilance, Johnny was invited by them as he was the expert. He would ensure that the case finally came to him for he knew how to get the camel under the cliff.</p>
		<p>There was a very senior guy, Gopalan (not his real name). Somehow, Johnny had a clash with him on some issue. Johnny challenged him openly by saying, “Mr Gopalan, count your days – I will see to it that you will be out within six months.” Gopalan was General Manager and Johnny was only Manager (Personnel) then. Yet he had the guts to challenge such a senior guy. In that company, for getting the subsidised-interest loan for the purchase of a car or scooter, the copy of the registration book of the vehicle was not required – just a simple declaration, supported with some registration number was sufficient. Many used to avail of this onetime subsidised-interest loan by making false declarations. Management always used to keep one eye closed. It was not a corrupt practice though it was a bad practice. Johnny discovered that Mr Gopalan had availed the subsidised-interest loan for the purchase of a car but had actually purchased a scooter, and provided his scooter registration number as the registration number of his car. Everyone knew this but no one regarded it as wrong as many had done the same. Johnny wrote an anonymous letter to CVO (Chief Vigilance Officer) giving the details of this transaction which he had gathered from Gopalan’s personal file.</p>
		<p><span>Once the <em>prima facie</em> charges were established, I was asked to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Gopalan. I had gone to the Chairman and pleaded with him arguing that it was not a case of corruption; it was the company’s bad policy which encouraged people to avail of the loan by giving wrong declarations. Then why should only Gopalan be punished? My Chairman understood what I meant. He shared with me the fact that Gopalan had already met him and informed him of the entire episode; about how he was challenged by Johnny in the presence of his lady secretary and a couple of visitors. “But, Siddiqui, I don’t want to get into the problem. I will go with the Vigilance report. I have already endorsed that initiating disciplinary action be taken against him.” To cut the story short, a charge-sheet was issued under the signatures of the Chairman and Managing Director, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Gopalan. Johnny was appointed to represent the case on behalf of the company. It was not difficult to prove the charges established against Gopalan. Gopalan was dismissed. Interestingly, all this happened within six months. The story spread </span>like a wild fire across the company. Johnny established his Gotcha character beyond doubt.</p>
		<p>During my workshops, I ask the practicing managers, “When you do something <em>Right</em>, what sort of response do you usually get?” I get the answer, ‘No response’. Then, I ask another question, “When you make a mistake, what sort of response do you usually get?” This time I get a variety of responses about how they were scolded, fired or cautioned by their bosses. The question is, “Why do we catch people doing <em>wrong</em>?” Why do we not catch people when they do something <em>right</em> - something good, something unusual or something miraculous? The reason is that in many organizations you find only Gotcha culture. When we grow in the Gotcha culture organization, we grow from Gotcha managers to Gotcha Bosses. We think that our job is to hold the searchlight to spot someone doing <em>Wrong</em>.</p>
		<p>I once asked a manager, “How do you know you are doing good work?” Without taking any time in thinking he retorted, “Simple! When I haven’t been chewed out lately by my boss!”</p>
		<p>“Managers seem to throw big searchlights on the misdirected actions,” Ken Blanchard makes a very valued observation in his famous book ‘Whale Done’. Even when you do something good you get yelled at… “Why didn’t you ask me – am I not your boss?”</p>
		<p>Learn to catch someone doing things right! Gotcha behaviour of bosses creates tension. Many organizations call management consultants to conduct workshops on ‘Stress Management’ to help their managers deal with work stress. The basic question which many CEOs forget is, ‘Where did the stress come from?” If not always, at least most of the time stress comes from Gotcha managers, Gotcha bosses and Gotcha environment of the organization. First, clean your organization and make it ‘Gotcha Free’. Then call in the consultants to conduct the workshops on ‘Stress Management’. This will work.</p>
		<p><strong>A few tips</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gotcha creates mistrust in the organization – a few incidents of Gotcha are sufficient to pollute the organization’s culture. </li>
			<li>Never ever encourage Gotcha Managers. Once you use them for grinding your own axe, they may grind their axes against you not once but many times. </li>
			<li>Gotcha managers turn into Gotcha bosses and create havoc in the organization. </li>
			<li>Take the ‘Gotcha’ incidents seriously. Identify Gotcha managers and counsel them. Tell them clearly that ‘Gotcha’ does not work in my company. Tell them the consequences – demonstrate your guts, and punish managers for their ‘Gotcha’ approach. </li>
			<li>‘Gotcha’ behaviour is highly infectious as well as contagious. It spreads fast. Take serious precautions to ensure your company does not get infected by such Gotcha managers and Gotcha bosses. </li>
			<li>Include ‘Gotcha behaviour’ in the list of grave misconducts. </li>
			<li>Arrange ‘Role Plays’ on ‘Gotcha bosses’ in your training classes. Then, let the group deliberate upon the serious consequences of Gotcha culture. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is great to have a position of power but do not use it. Like any resource, once you use it, it loses its effect in the course of time. Do not force your people to do things or influence them. Learn to praise your people. Offer praise immediately. Do not confine your praise only to ‘performance’ but also praise their behavioural traits like honesty, truthfulness, caring, trust etc.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Gotcha is negative. Negativity cannot be countered with another negativity. The only way to counter the negative response is through your positive response. So, accentuate the positive! </em></p>
