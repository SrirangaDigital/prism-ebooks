		<p>Picture it!</p>
		<p>You have a talented guy who is very competent and committed as well. You have assigned a task to him and given him a deadline. Now, do you let him do his work and simply touch base with him at pre-defined points of time OR do you keep directing him and coercing him by dropping by his desk and sending emails to check his progress? If your style is the latter, then in some way you might be micromanaging the tasks. Micromanaging also mean carrying on with the low-end tasks after attaining a high-end position.</p>
		<p>In many cases, micromanagers have perfectly positive attributes – an attention to detail and a hands-on-approach which they carry to the extreme. There are many reasons for their attitude – either they are ‘control-freaks’ or they do not have confidence in their juniors. In the latter case, they ruin the confidence of their juniors to the point that they might feel it is time to quit.</p>
		<p>Micromanagers operate between two nuances – ‘being involved’ or ‘being over-involved’ in the work of their juniors. Being involved is good; being over-involved is akin to micromanaging.</p>
		<p>Many go up in the hierarchy, higher and higher, still performing the tasks they were doing when they were three levels lower in the hierarchy. They are micromanagers. When they grow to be the boss, they become ‘Micromanaging Bosses’.</p>
		<p>Micromanaging bosses are the victims of their life script. Most of us are the products of our own life script – a story or incident that we encountered during our childhood gets etched in our mind so deeply that this life script dictates our future behavioural pattern. I am providing a sample of a life script. Please read it carefully.</p>
		<p><strong>Sparrows and Baby-sparrows</strong></p>
		<p class="myquote">Two sparrows and their babies lived happily in their nest on the top of a tree. Once, when the parent-sparrows returned in the evening, the baby-sparrows anxiously suggested that they leave the tree immediately because they had heard the farmer murmuring, “I will get my friends and cut this tree tomorrow.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the mother sparrow reassuringly to the frightened baby-sparrows.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Next day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer saying, “My friends deceived me – they never turned up. I will ask my son and wife to help me cut this tree tomorrow.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the father-sparrow reassuringly to the frightened baby-sparrows.</p>
		<p class="myquote">On the third day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer grudgingly say, “My own people ditched me. It is better to spend some money and get the work done. I will hire some labourers and cut this tree tomorrow.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen,” said the parent-sparrows reassuringly to the terrified baby-sparrows.</p>
		<p class="myquote">On the fourth day, the baby-sparrows heard the farmer say, “No one can be depended upon in this world. One has to bear one’s own cross. Tomorrow I will grind my axe to make it sharp and then cut this tree.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">When the baby-sparrows told this to their parents, the parent-sparrows said, “Now the time has come for us to fly away.” Without wasting any time they flew away from the tree.</p>
		<p>Imagine that this story is told to you during your childhood, not once but many times, and you register this story in your mind so deeply that it eventually becomes your life script. Can you imagine what pattern of behaviour will you develop based on this story? As a child you will be convinced that nothing will move unless you squarely deal with the situation yourself. In other words, you will grow up with the belief that things will move only when you put your shoulder to the wheel, otherwise nothing can happen. This will dictate a pattern of behaviour where you manage everything by yourself - small and big - as you want to get results. If you grow up with such a behavioural pattern, the chances are very bright that you will turn out to be a micromanager and later a micromanaging boss.</p>
		<p>This life script happens to many people. This can also happen owing to ignorance of the fact that when they grow in the hierarchy they should also know their priorities. If a General Manager continues to perform the tasks which he or she was performing as a manager, then he still remains a manager but with a higher designation. He does not deserve to be called General Manager.</p>
		<p>Sometimes a manager becomes a micromanager due to his passion for low-end tasks. Creating a good banner on ‘Pages’ may be one of my skills and passion as a Training Officer. I grow to be a Training Manager and continue to design the banners and brochures myself, though others are equally capable of doing this. Then, I reach the coveted position of Vice President (HR).Yet I take pleasure in designing the banners and brochures. Why I am doing so? It is because using ‘Pages’ is my passion. Is it worthy of my position? Certainly not! I am supposed to be doing better things – high-end tasks.</p>
		<p>In one of his articles, Peter Drucker has mentioned that amongst the American Presidents, he found that one of them, who was otherwise a gem of person, suffering from this syndrome of ‘micromanaging’ every task. Can you guess who was this President? It was Jimmy Carter! As per Peter Drucker, Jimmy Carter was a very capable President. He would have contributed more to the nation if he had just given up his ‘micromanaging’ habit.</p>
		<p>In a way I am lucky not to have many ‘Micromanaging Bosses’. Beside Mr RA Sharan, whom I have mentioned in the earlier chapter ‘Stone Age Boss’, I also worked with Linganna who used to micromanage the work on the plea of ‘daily business review’. He was Executive Director of the entire business group. Yet, every day he used to visit each SBU (Strategic Business Unit) for a ‘review’. His day used to start from 8 AM and end late at night. He would visit my factory during his last work-shift , at 4 or 5 PM, and continue bulldozing managers till late in the evening. My General Manager and I found no value addition – during the second half of the day, our people used to go barging around obeying his orders and the next morning, during the first half, they devoted their entire time in preparing and collecting production data to save their skin.</p>
		<p>Once the production manager shared his heart with me, “Mr Siddiqui, where is the time to concentrate on production – half day we prepare data and the remaining half of the day is spent scampering about to furnish data. You cannot run a company by simply collecting data!” He was right. The Executive Director was more interested in the figures than actual production on the shop floor. After sometime, my managers became smarter. They learnt to ‘Say what pleases the King’s ears!’</p>
		<p>Once, after a meeting, my General Manager and I went down the corridor to see him off at 8.30 PM. After waving hands, we were returning. We heard the loud sound of a honk. The guard came running to us shouting that the ED’s car had returned and that Mr Linganna was calling out for me. I rushed. I thought there must be some important message that had made my Executive Director to take a ‘U’ turn. When I reached his car, I saw Linganna leaning out from the rear window and waving his (dirty) pair of socks. I could not understand what he was doing. Then he laughed and said, “Siddiqui, see… I do not have time even to wear my socks. In the morning, my wife gave these socks to me to wear; it is now night and I still couldn’t find time to wear them. Be my witness. I am putting them on now!” We both once again waved our hands to him and his car zoomed off.</p>
		<p>“What a pity!” I thought. “How can this guy manage three factories under his charge when he cannot even manage his time to wear a pair of socks!!” I remembered how once Lee Iacocca had sacked one of the CEOs of his company. Can you guess what was the fault of the CEO? When Lee Iacocca visited the particular factory for the first time, after taking charge as the Chairman of the company, he asked the CEO, “When did you last go on a vacation with your family?” The CEO replied, “Sir, I don’t have time for such luxury. For the last three years I have not taken leave for a single day – no question of my going on vacation with the family.” Lee Iacocca smiled and said, “You are fired – now go and have a nice time with your family.” Then he clarified, “I don’t want guys who do not know how to manage their holidays to head my business. Those who cannot manage their personal time cannot manage the business.” Though this sounds a bit harsh, he was right.</p>
		<p>The CEOs are paid a fat salary not for deciding the menu and venues for corporate dinners. Micromanaging is an unpardonable sin that many corporate Pharaohs commit without any feeling of guilt.</p>
		<p>Here are some tips to identify the micromanaging bosses:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They resist ‘delegation’, let alone empowering their people. </li>
			<li>They immerse themselves in ‘overseeing’ the projects of their juniors even though the guys are capable. </li>
			<li>They are fault-finders always looking for some minor mistakes to correct instead of looking at the big picture. </li>
			<li>They take back the powers delegated to the juniors if they find even one minor or negligible mistake. </li>
			<li>They discourage their juniors from making decisions without consulting them. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>When a boss is reluctant to delegate work, focuses on details instead of the big picture and discourages his staff from taking the initiative, there is every chance that he is sliding towards micromanaging the work. Be alert and try out some of the following suggestions as a remedial measure for such bosses!</p>
		<p><strong>Some Tips for managing micromanaging bosses:</strong> If you are micromanaged by your boss, help him discover that there are many other ways to get better results. Make him focus on his ‘delegation’ skills and learn to trust his people to develop and deliver.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Win the confidence of your boss by demonstrating your competence so that he starts trusting you though initially it will be shakily. </li>
			<li>Come forward and volunteer to take on some projects that you are confident you can handle. </li>
			<li>Make sure that you communicate the progress in the project regularly to discourage him from seeking information. Before he asks, you must provide the data and update him of the progress so that he does not feel the need to micromanage your work. </li>
			<li>Concentrate on helping your boss to change one ‘micromanaging habit’ at a time. Remember how addicts are cured. They are not cured with a sudden withdrawal of the drugs. The process of withdrawal is quite slow. You cannot eat an elephant in a single gulp. But you can eat the entire elephant if you cut him in pieces and eat the pieces, one by one. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>The CEO (Chief Executive Officer) should not reduce himself to the position of COE (Chief Operating Executive). Many do not have this simple wisdom.</p>
