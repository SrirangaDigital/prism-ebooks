		<p>‘Abdication’ is the 180 degrees opposite of ‘Micromanagement’.</p>
		<p>During my assignment in NHPC (National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation) I had another colleague Mr Singh (besides Thakur). He was from Bihar. Both of us were working there as Deputy Manager Personnel. We both were assisting our chief boss, the Chief Engineer, who was the project chief of the Baira Siul Hydroelectric Project. The workload was evenly divided between the two of us.</p>
		<p>I used to go early to work and sit late in the evenings; yet I was not able to cope up with workload. However, my colleague, Singh, used to finish his entire work by noon and come to me only to see that I was still sweating it out trying to cope up with the workload.</p>
		<p>“Siddiqui Ji, you are always busy. Leave your work for a while. Let us have a good chat.”</p>
		<p>“What about you?” I would ask enviously and sometimes even jealously when I saw him in such a casual mood while I was drowning in the sea of the unmanageable workload.</p>
		<p>“I have already finished my job… will you not get me a cup of coffee?” he would ask. I would force myself to take a few</p>
		<p>minutes off, waiting impatiently for Singh to go so that I could get back to my routine.</p>
		<p>When this happened many times, I became eager to know his managing technique. How could he finish the entire task just in a few hours, whereas I used to sweat it out the entire day? I decided to find out the secret of his efficient way of managing the task. Sudesh, who was earlier working in my team, was recently transferred to Singh. I thought of calling him secretly to find out the secret of Singh’s ‘excellent’ managing techniques.</p>
		<p>Sudesh came to me but disappointed me by saying, “Siddiqui Sir, you cannot do what Mr Singh can do!”</p>
		<p>“Do you mean I am so incapable that I can’t even copy Mr Singh’s managing practices?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“Sir, you may feel bad,” Sudesh told me, “ But, believe me, <em>you</em> cannot do what Mr Singh does.” He repeated the sentence. Then he shared Mr Singh’s secret techniques in these words:</p>
		<p>“When I go to Mr Singh carrying a big load of files, he asks me to give them to him, one by one. When I give a file to him he asks me in Bihari Hindi, “<em>Yeh kaa hai</em>? (What is this?) So, I explain the entire case. If I am not able to explain he asks me to go back and come back to him after understanding the file details clearly. After I explain the entire case, he asks the second question, “<em>Hum ko kaa karna hai</em>?” (What I am supposed to do?) So I then suggest what he is supposed to do. If I am not able to suggest anything, he will ask me how I had solved such an issue in yester years. Then I explain to him what we did earlier in such a similar situation. On hearing this he will say, <em>“Waisa hi kar do</em>” ( do likewise). This way, using only these three sentences - (1) <em>Yeh kaa hai </em>(What is this) (2) <em>Hum ko kaa karna hai</em>? (What I am supposed to do?) and finally (3) <em>Waisa hi kar do</em> (Do likewise) - he completes his entire task in one hour and like a donkey I work late into the night to complete the task. He does not even ask me if the tasks were completed or how I completed those tasks! It is none of his concern.”</p>
		<p>“You are right. I cannot do this!” I confessed and both of us had a hearty laugh.</p>
		<p>Like <em>Micromanagement</em>, <em>Abdication</em> is a great corporate sin. These are two opposite extremes. Truth lies somewhere at the middle.</p>
		<p><strong>A few tips</strong></p>
		<p>Abdication is not Empowerment. In Empowerment, first you judge the capabilities of your people – their competence and commitment. You are supposed to empower only when both are positive. If a person is weak in competence, he needs training and coaching. If a person is negative in commitment, he needs counselling to improve his attitude and behaviour. If a person is weak, both in competence and commitment, you have no other option than to control. Once you find your guy is fully competent and totally committed, close your eyes and ‘Empower’ him.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Abdication is not Empowerment, though in both cases you let your people free to handle the situations. In Abdication you shift the buck; in Empowerment you create trust and confidence. </em></p>
