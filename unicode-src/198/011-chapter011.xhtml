		<p>Mohammad Bin Tughlaq is one of the victims of historians. He has been so wrongly portrayed that the connotation ‘Mohammad Tughlaq’ is used as a synonym for foolish and crazy fellows. He was one of the brilliant Kings of the Moghul Empire in India – a man capable of designing the best political strategies. He failed in implementation owing to his anxiety for speedy results. To my mind, he was born before his time. Had he been born in today’s era, where speed is the only Goddess of Worship, he would have proved that he was one of the best strategists.</p>
		<p>PC Neogi was one such mistaken genius. He was highly intelligent, a voracious reader and a man of knowledge. When he joined our company as the Chairman and Managing Director, many (including myself) went back to the basics to get a face-lift.</p>
		<p>PC Neogi was a genius who always spoke ahead of his time. He was a very energetic person bubbling with enthusiasm – honest to the core. Many people could not match their pace with his speed. He wanted his people to fly but most of them were behaving like a herd of clumsy buffaloes. When you do not understand the lofty thoughts of a genius you start making fun of him. This is why his people gave him the nickname ‘Mohammad Tughlaq’.</p>
		<p>Those were days when I was given the assignment by my new CEO to create a ‘Learning Organization’. Once he was taking a flight to Delhi and sent a book to me from the airport because he thought it would make useful reading for an HRD-ian. It was Peter F Drucker’s ‘Managing for the Future’. It was neither the fame of the author nor the text of the book that moved me. It was the ‘highly thoughtful’ gesture of the CEO who sent a book from the airport to an HR person. That gesture deeply touched my soul.</p>
		<p>At home, later, I stood before a mirror – and I found in my image a person covered with the dust of obsolescence. I rolled up my sleeves and decided to get back to the basics of what HRD is all about! Wisdom dawned on me: <em>in the era of nanoseconds I am required to increase my pace. </em>It is a matter of survival. And creating a true learning organization is the only remedy.</p>
		<p>I learnt many things from this Mohammad Tughlaq boss. Learning is breathing in; creativity is breathing out. Those who breathe in are the ones who can breathe out. Such a simple HRD equation but many people do not understand it.</p>
		<p>Again, the ability to learn depends on the learning horizon. For some, learning is space-less and for some, learning is endless – creativity becomes their staple food.</p>
		<p>My CEO always remained an inquisitive learner. He often used to say, “Recharge yourself from the books and learn from everyone and from every incident. Begin your job afresh everyday.” He was very fond of quoting Swami Vivekananda: <em>Every soul is potentially divine! </em></p>
		<p>He untiringly persuaded his people to use the right side of their brain. “The brain is brilliantly uncreative in the sense that it will use the same pattern again and again under all circumstances,” he once explained to me by borrowing the words of Edward de Bono. “Creativity comes from meditation” was his unshaken faith and ‘Management by Meditation’ was his steadfast religion.</p>
		<p>It took me months to follow the flight of his thoughts. What he perhaps meant was, ‘First shape the idea softly, then bake it to harden it with practice.’ Obviously, one needs to go through two phases – imaginative phase and practical phase. I caught the catch phrase: Think of something different to get something original done.</p>
		<p>“Why can’t you make the tractor bonnets out of wood!” he would suggest to an R&#38;D guy, only to see people around laugh up their sleeves. In another meeting he said, “I want slim watches; take a hacksaw and slice these shoddy fat watches.” He suggested this to one of our watch designers in a unit located at a far-flung place. The echo of the soundless laughter of those around him reached me at the corporate office. This still vibrates my eardrums. I still shudder at their ignorance for they did not know the type of thinking pattern the genius was trying to teach them.</p>
		<p>And a day came when he gave a smacking whack on the right side of my head. I had gone to get his approval for campus recruitment to cover the shortage of HRD officers caused by an unprecedented exodus owing to market demand in the private sector. When I submitted the proposal in writing, he just wrote down “Create HRD out of mud”. Reading my face carefully, he pointed his finger towards a beautiful painting of a potter who was training his daughter how to make pottery out of soft clay. The inscription below captured my eyes – A Potter and the Clay.</p>
		<p>I did not ask a single question as I had understood what he meant. Instead of recruiting new guys he wanted me to develop the skills of the existing people who were not gainfully utilized.</p>
		<p>“Don’t look elsewhere to see what everyone is doing – think for yourself and do it,” he said with a pleasant smile and returned the file to me.</p>
		<p><strong>Tips for Mohammad Tughlaq Bosses:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>They must understand that they have been born ahead of their time but this not true for everyone. Many good movies fail not because they were bad; they fail because the moviegoers have not attained the maturity to understand them. Likewise, many management strategies fail, not because of their weakness but for they being ahead of their time. </li>
			<li>The strongest thing in the world is an idea whose time has come. A bright idea fails if its time has not come. </li>
			<li>Good strategies are not enough – we should find the right way and the right people for successful implementation of those brilliant ideas. ‘Shifting the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad’ was the bright idea of Mohammad Tughlaq; yet this ploy failed owing to bad execution. </li>
			<li>For good execution of bright ideas you must keep focus on (1) Strategies (2) People and (3) Processes. All the three are essential for perfect execution. </li>
