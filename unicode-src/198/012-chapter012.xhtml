		<p>Who was this ‘Baba-Yaga’? To know about ‘Baba-Yaga’ Bosses, you must know who was ‘Baba-Yaga’! Before I tell you about Baba-Yaga, let me share a story about the stern mother-in-law.</p>
		<p class="myquote">In a village, a very stern mother-in-law headed a joint family. Her daughter-in-law was being inducted gradually into the family traditions. The young girl often observed the austere and stingy nature of her mother-in-law. In the village, beggars would visit the households on specific days for alms. The young daughter-in-law had seen her motherin-law shoo away the beggars every time they came to their house.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Once, a beggar came to the doorstep when the daughter-in-law was around. As per the ‘family tradition’, she asked him to leave.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Just then her mother-in-law appeared on the scene and admonished the daughter-in-law, “Why did you drive away the beggar?” Surprised at the change of heart in the mother-in-law, the young girl offered to call back the beggar. The beggar expectantly scurried back to the front door.</p>
		<p class="myquote">The old lady thundered, “Scoot off, you bandicoot! Of course, you are not getting any alms from this household!”</p>
		<p class="myquote">Thereafter, she updated the young girl on the theoretical aspects of her peculiar behaviour. “Don’t dare use the power not handed down to you.”</p>
		<p>This beautiful story tells us all about ‘Patriarchy’ – an antithesis to ‘Empowerment’. Patriarchal bosses manage through ‘Command’ and ‘Control’ I call them ‘Stern Mother-in-Law Bosses’. During my active corporate life of over three decades I found such ‘Stern Mother-in-Laws’ everywhere. They exist in the manufacturing industry; they exist in the mining industry; they exist in the IT industry; they exist in the Service and Hospitality industry and they also exist in many Management Institutions. They have a very commanding personality and are highly ‘Power Conscious’.</p>
		<p>During my sessions when I ask, “Do you have any such ‘Stern Mother-in-Laws’ in your organization?’, I do not get an immediate reply. I enjoy watching their furtive smiles which proclaim to me, “How can I say ‘Yes’?” Then I assure them that my question is purely for an academic purpose and their whispers will not reach the ears of the bosses. Only then do one or two delegates muster up courage and share some of their pathetic experiences with their Stern Mother-in-Law type of bosses.</p>
		<p>When I was reading a Russian Fairy Tale of ‘Baba-Yaga’, I found this term ‘Baba-Yaga’ explains ‘Patriarchal’ characteristics much better than the terminology ‘Stern Mother-in-Law’. Whereas the ‘Stern Mother-in-Law’ character can be best understood by Indian managers, the ‘Baba-Yaga’ character has global acceptability.</p>
		<p>Now I will explain who was Baba-Yaga’! Let me narrate briefly the famous Russian Fairy Tale – ‘Baba-Yaga – the Cannibal Witch’!</p>
		<p class="myquote">Long, long ago, in a certain Tsardom, there lived a beautiful girl – Vasilisa. She had a little wise doll which was her true foul-weather companion.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Once, Vasilisa was caught by Baba-Yaga, the cunning and sly witch who gobbled up people in the wink of an eye. The cruel witch lived in a huge castle. The fence around the castle was made of human bones and crowned with human skulls. The gate was not a wooden gate but was made from the bones of men’s legs; the bolts were not iron bolts but were made up of the bones of men’s arms, and the lock was not an iron lock but a lock made from a set of sharp teeth. Baba-Yaga had her own obedient and faithful force – all dreaded creatures, viz. a black-browed maid, a birch-tree, a wild ferocious dog, a wicked gate, and an old Grumbler-Rumbler, the cat. All were groomed to obey her and follow her commands blindly.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Night descended, and many of the eyes of the skulls crowning the fence began to glow and brought light making the night look like the day.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Baba-Yaga returned in the evening. The Earth trembled and rocked beneath Vasilisa’s feet. There was Baba-Yaga flying up in a mortar, swinging her pestle like a whip and sweeping the tracks away with a broom. Vasilisa got frightened but did not lose heart. She decided to face Baba-Yaga boldly.</p>
		<p class="myquote">The cruel witch was very hungry and wanted to eat Vasilisa. She ordered, “Light the stove, black-browed maid, and make the fire hot. When I wake up, I shall roast Vasilisa!”</p>
		<p class="myquote">And Baba-Yaga lay down on a bench, placed her chin on a shelf, covered herself with her foot and began to snore so loudly that the whole forest trembled and shook.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Vasilisa mustered up courage. She consulted her wise doll for advice. The doll whispered something in her ears.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Vasilisa rushed to the black-browed maid and bowed low to her. “Please, black-browed maid, help me!”, she cried, “When you are lighting the stove, pour water over the wood so it does not burn the way it should.” Vasilisa then approached every creature and politely requested them to help her. They expressed their sympathy but were unwilling to help her for their own safety. Vasilisa told them that they were all really powerful creatures. The strength of Baba-Yaga was not really her’s alone but lay in them. They should help her only of they were convinced about this. Once they withdrew their support, Baba-Yaga’s magic castle would collapse like a house of cards.</p>
		<p class="myquote">The black-browed maid and other blind followers of the cruel witch were caught in a dilemma – whether to follow helplessly and unwillingly the dictatorial commands of their dreadful master, the barbarous witch, or to accept the polite request of the little honest girl!</p>
		<p class="myquote">‘Were they really more powerful than their master?’ This strange and chaste thought softy tingled their minds. There was a lull, a moment filled with the mystery and suspense of a ghostly graveyard.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Baba-Yaga woke up and stretched her arms. Seeing that Vasilisa was gone, she rushed out into the passage and shouted out in anger.</p>
		<p class="myquote">“Did you stretch Vasilisa as she ran, Grumbler-Rumbler?” she demanded to know.</p>
		<p class="myquote">And the cat replied coolly. “No, I let her pass for she was polite to me. I served you for ten years, Baba-Yaga, but you never gave me any love or affection.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">Baba-Yaga rushed out into the yard. “Did you bite Vasilisa, my faithful dog?” she demanded to know.</p>
		<p class="myquote">“No, I let her pass for she gave me respect. I served you for ever so many years but you always ill-treated me.”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“Birch-tree!” Baba- Yaga roared in anger, “Did you pull out Vasilisa’s eyes?”</p>
		<p class="myquote">Said the Birch-tree in reply, “No, I let her pass for she bound me with her love and affection. I have been growing here for ten years and you have never even treated me decently!”</p>
		<p class="myquote">Baba-Yaga ran to the gate. “Gate, gate!” she cried, “Did you shut yourself so that Vasilisa could not pass through you?”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“No, I let her pass for she greased my hinges and served my long felt need. I served you for ever so long but you never even put water on them”, replied the gate.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Baba-Yaga flew into a temper. She began to beat the dog, thrash the cat, break down the gate and chop down the birch-tree. Soon she felt so tired that she forgot all about Vasilisa. The beautiful wise girl, who was still hiding in the castle, stealthily slipped out and ran away as fast as she could. On the way she heard a loud sound as though the Earth had been badly shaken. She turned around only to see a blazing castle. The powerful structure was collapsing like a house of cards. All the strange creatures were walking out confidently and safely. Baba-Yaga was nowhere in sight. Perhaps, she had been caught in the fire and was now buried under the debris of her castle.</p>
		<p>I have discerned in this fairy-tale all the elements that exist in a patriarchal environment. The tale carries a strong message for bosses that by not supporting your juniors, you cannot achieve your objectives. By following the rules laid down by a patriarchal system, all the Vasilisas– the high-fliers and achievers - would be lost within the insensitive Baba-Yagas’ patriarchal system and power centres.</p>
		<p>Even your subordinates will withdraw their support once they are convinced that their efforts are not benefiting the company.</p>
		<p>Employees are like shareholders in a company. When the shareholders withdraw their share, the company faces a financial turmoil. However, withdrawal of the employees’ share - comprising of sincere contribution, commitment and whole-hearted cooperation - is not visible to those who do not see the ‘invisible’.</p>
		<p>Like a shareholder, an employee too invests his capacity, ability and emotions in a company. Again, like a shareholder, he seeks returns. He expects a fair return for the work he does, as well as a continually growing career. Since he has made an emotional investment in the company, he also expects a fair deal and fair treatment. An employee, like a shareholder, is capable of moving away from his commitment. “This movement may be a reduction in his commitment. Unless the employee sees some satisfaction in what he is doing and receives respect in return for his service, the commitment will not be made,” observes Albert Low in Zen and Creative Management. The Baba-Yagas in today’s business can ill-afford the luxury of discounting this fact. They cannot take the loyalties, the commitment and the sincere services of black-browed maids and birch trees and Grumbler-Rumbler for granted anymore.</p>
		<p>The Baba-Yaga of the Russian fairy-tale characterizes a typical patriarchal boss who gives precedence to self-interest and self-esteem over the company’s objectives. A halo of egotism always crowns his head. His actions aim at building his own image and gaining personal mileage out of the employees’ work. “We want to be promoted,” writes Peter Block,” to have more responsibility, to have control over more people; in other words, the more power we have, the better off we are.”</p>
		<p>The taste of power to most of us is like the taste of the roasted flesh of Vasilisa to Baba-Yaga. A cannibal tends to appreciate the beauty of a little girl only in terms of the weight of her flesh and bones – beauty is of no concern to him. A patriarchal boss, likewise, tends to seek ego-seduction – productivity and company’s objectives are secondary. Even the high-fliers are not spared in the anxiety of monitoring and persuasion. “It is like whipping a horse that’s already running as fast as it can” write Eli Goldratt and Jeff Cox in ‘The Goal’. Obviously, some of these fast-running horses fall and get injured when they are harshly whipped. While turning around a company or managing a change, a CEO must always remember what Abraham Lincoln once said, “It is best not to swap horses while crossing the river.” Managing change is far more difficult than crossing a river in flood. The high-fliers need extra care at such an hour of test and trail.</p>
		<p>The huge castle of Baba-Yaga, the fence around it - made of human bones and crowned with human skulls - symbolizes the power centres in a patriarchal work environment where managers always hear an unspoken command that permission of their superiors is a must; even before inhaling. They are made aware that the Baba-Yagas have super powers, and can ‘blow out their candle without even taking a deep breath’.</p>
		<p>The reign of fear and phobia snuffs out creativity, ingenuity and intuitive reflexes. Everyone would like to play a safe-game lest Baba-Yaga shower upon them her wrath and curses. In such a work culture, status-quo pays off and the risk-taking urge rests in deep slumber. The more height we gain, the more we look for safety. The desire ‘to hold on to what we already have’ will increase as we climb up the ladder of hierarchy. The greater the tragic fall, the greater will be the desire to restore the status-quo.</p>
		<p>Stern Corporate Mother-in-Laws and Baba-Yaga bosses must understand that Empowerment is a vital management philosophy which motivates and inspires people. It is easier to preach than practise. However, it is a grossly misconceived myopic approach to regard it as being actually simple delegation of work. The formal delegation of authority is a bureaucratic tool which is contaminated and dust-laden. Those who want to empower their people only through delegation of power still seem to be standing on their heads. If they stand back on their feet and have a fresh look at the pyramid, they will see that the pyramid gets inverted. An inverted flattened pyramid can more appropriately be assigned to the philosophy of Empowerment. Empowerment is the antithesis of Patriarchy.</p>
		<p>‘Share power, don’t give it away’ is the key tenet of Empowerment. There are two kinds of power – <em>visionary</em> power and <em>operational</em> power. However, it is the latter type of power which should be shared. The visionary power must lie with the CEO who shapes corporate vision and gives it a sense of direction. This power can be shared with others only on a limited basis so as to get a variety of ideas to hone up and perfect the CEO’s corporate vision.</p>
		<p>Visionary bosses not only help their people to climb up the ladder but also ensure that the ladder is leaning against the right wall. “Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning to the right wall.” says Dr Stephen Covey. Empowerment given to one’s people without showing them the right direction does zero good. <em>Vision </em>should precede <em>Empowerment</em>.</p>
		<p>Baba-Yaga bosses must realize that Empowerment is a movement rather than a concept. It will launch a sustained assault on the patriarchal approach which has been dominating our thoughts right from our school days. Empowerment is not a slogan for preaching. It is an emotion-filled mission, designed to destroy the power centres and to demolish the tall pyramids. “For management, empowerment is the giving up of some control and sharing of additional knowledge of company goals and achievements,” says Marcia Lewis, Principal, Lewis Bruke Consulting Group. For employees, it is the acceptance of risk by taking more responsibility. Both must be prepared to define objectives in terms of business goals. In the entrepreneurial interest, management must allow employees to play an important role in the day-to-day company affairs.</p>
		<p>The patriarchal strategies of Baba-Yaga lie in a systematic well-drawn plan and the clearly communicated orders to the blackbrowed maid to light the stove and make the flame very hot and roast Vasilisa to satiate the gourmet’s taste. They are designed to achieve personal gains in the name of organizational objectives. Obviously, the patriarchal boss resorts to these strategies to get the roasted dish of Vasilisa’s tender flesh cooked by his faithful blackbrowed maids for his exclusive consumption. They forget the simple fact – you can see the real picture only when you take your ‘You’ out of it.</p>
		<p>The harsh treatment meted out by Baba-Yaga to her own loyal and obedient servant, and animals is not merely a simple diabolic characterization of the cruel witch. It is a business piece of metaphor to paint and highlight the patriarchal approach of Baba-Yaga. The Patriarchal Bosses can learn many things from this simple story of the cannibal witch.</p>
		<p>“Do what I say; if you don’t obey, not only your career growth but your very existence in the company will be in danger.” Such unspoken signals are given to the subordinates by the simple blink of an eye or raised eyebrows of the patriarchal bosses.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Baba-Yaga loses Vasilisa – the prime objective of her entire strategic mission! This happens because Baba-Yaga’s concentration shifts from Vasilisa to meting out harsh treatment to her own once-upon-a-time faithful and obedient work-force. When the ego of a patriarchal boss is hurt, he loses sight of his objective. He begins to beat his dogs and to thrash his cats, to break down the gates and to chop down the birch trees. And ultimately he gets so tired that he forgets all about the Vasilisas– the organizational objectives or its vision – the purpose of its very existence!</p>
		<p>In sharp contrast to the patriarchal approach of Baba-Yaga, the beautiful Vasilisa adopts a policy of involvement and honest communication. She creates awareness in the entranced creatures of the patriarchal power centre. She infuses in them the spirit of intellectual integrity which eventually results in an collective assault on the patriarchal system leading to its total collapse.</p>
		<p>Boldness is the key to success. The central tenet of Empowerment is boldness. The eventual independence of the Indian nation too rests on the ‘truth’ of Empowerment without ‘violence’.</p>
		<p>Knowledge, skill, potential, commitment and competence – these positive traits and qualities are the essential prerequisites of an empowered environment where the brave new manager will begin his work. The wise doll of Vasilisa’s epitomises these traits in the fairy tale. Vasilisa’s humility and the doll’s wisdom provide a cross-functional approach to the strategic plan leading to her wonderful escape.</p>
		<p>The most significant aspect of the fairy-tale is perhaps the favourable situation created by the wise and beautiful little girl. The non-transparent and dreadful environment had made the creatures spineless. They were caught in the myth that if they stood up and spoke against Baba-Yaga, the cruel witch would finish them off. But once their spines were straightened and their hearts filled with courage, they stand up and face the challenges boldly. They demolish the entire power centre and manage to come out of the inferno alive (with minor bruises here and there).</p>
		<p>Here is a bold suggestion from Peter Block to face the Baba-Yaga bosses. “If people in power above do not like what I am doing, let them stop me. Better to be seen as stubborn than incompetent,” says Peter Block. “There is quiet revolution taking place in many organizations. It is time managers must know leaning is important – the direction in which they lean.”</p>
		<p>M R Kopmeyer, an American success counsellor, spontaneously comes up with the answer. “Always lean into the storm of life. Lean toward danger – never away from it.” We should acquire boldness to get along with such power-hungry and power-sucker bosses.</p>
		<p>A manager’s leanings determine his real managerial personality. It brands him. His people, juniors as well as seniors, assess him accordingly and know what to expect. “Don’t fall out of fear. Once anyone falls, everybody pushes the falling fence,” says a Chinese sage. One must learn to empower oneself if Empowerment does not come to him by grace.</p>
		<p><strong>Tips to get along with Baba-Yaga bosses</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be bold. </li>
			<li>‘Boldness in business is the first, second and third thing.’ </li>
			<li>Boldness does not mean a trial of muscle power. There is a distinct difference between stretching the risk-muscles and flexing the power-muscles. The former is good; the latter is bad.</li>
			<li>Do not make a vulgar display of egotism. If you do, you must know that you are suffering from a disease called egomania which stems from an inferiority complex. </li>
			<li>Remember – ‘He who doesn’t lose his wits over certain things has no wits to lose’. </li>
			<li>‘Empower yourself, if others cannot.’ </li>
			<li>Use your assertive rights – never complain, never explain. </li>
			<li>Choose autonomy over dependency – learn to be unstoppable. </li>
			<li>It is better to err than not to perform – managers can also be moulded out of faults. </li>
			<li>Show courage rather than embrace caution with the fear of falling from the ladder of hierarchy. Only weak people fall, the fearless managers know how to climb higher and higher amidst all odds. </li>
			<li>Do not forget that ‘People at the bottom have more power than they realize and people at the top have less power than that attributed to them’. </li>
			<li>Ignorance is not bliss – it is oblivion. Wisdom comes to those who are aware of their ignorance. </li>
			<li>Your job ‘is not to reform the boss, not to re-educate the boss, not to make the boss conform to what the business schools and the management books say about what bosses should be like’. </li>
			<li>Defer no time; delays have dangerous ends. </li>
			<li>If you are on the look for security, do not forget – your boss too needs his own security blanket. </li>
			<li>‘He that will not sail till all dangers are over must never be put to sea.’ If you do not want to take any risk, better not remain within the arena of entrepreneurship. </li>
			<li>Study carefully - What are the things the boss does well? What are his strengths? And what are the boss’s limitations and weaknesses – the areas in which the subordinate needs to support, to buttress and to supplement the boss? A manager’s task is to make the strength of his people effective and their weaknesses irrelevant. </li>
			<li>Never underrate the boss! The boss may look illiterate, he may look ignorant – looks are at times deceptive. The lesson, ‘Don’t discount others’ applies to bosses as well. </li>
			<li>Do not behave larger than life-size. A heroic manager is as bad a parasite as is a low performer – both contribute to the decadence of an organization. </li>
			<li>Make sure the boss understands what can be expected of you, the objectives and goals on which your own energies and those of your people will be concentrated upon, what your priorities are and equally important, what they are not. </li>
			<li>The first person on whom a manager’s performance depends upon is the ‘boss’ and the boss is, therefore, the first person for whose performance a manager has to take responsibility… Can you find out what the boss needs and what gets in the boss’s way? This does not mean one must succumb to the patriarchal urges of one’s boss. ‘Sobriety’ is a prerequisite to ‘courage’ – maintain distance between ‘courage’ and ‘aggression.’ You are not supposed to be aggressive with your boss.</li>
			<li>Never ever become a ‘Chocolate-cream soldier’ – a soldier who has never seen action in battle. Battle on courageously. Fighting against patriarchy is a holy war. </li>
			<li>Managers should not forget ‘the real risk is in doing nothing.’ </li>
			<li>Never play too safe. ‘The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions’. </li>
			<li>Remember - ‘He that is too secure is not safe’. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>A coward dies every day – a person with courage dies only once. If death becomes imminent, it should be faced with grace and courage. It is always better to die once rather than see the lurking shadows of death every day. In terms of employment, death is synonymous with being fired or sacked. It is better to be fired for demonstrating your spine by showing courage with sobriety, rather than falling due to spineless inaction or incompetence. ‘If anything can go wrong, it will’. Someone may face the situation boldly, others may raise their hands in total surrender. If the choice is between risk-taking and escapism – choose the former. But ‘the goal is to take reasonable risks, not to commit suicide’.</p>
		<p>Remember, courage and aggression are not synonymous – sobriety contrasts arrogance. Arrogance should always be unwelcome, even if it be the arrogance of intelligence. “Whenever we talk about courage, our minds turn to fantasies of either homicide or suicide,” observes Peter Block. “All we are fighting is bureaucracy, we are not reclaiming the Northwest Territory for our homeland.”</p>
		<p>The key to success of any manager lies in the four Cs – Competence, Commitment, Courage and Courtesy (Sobriety).</p>
		<p>Vasilisa’s courage was neither filled with arrogance nor with aggression. She demonstrated her spine, maintaining sobriety. Her wisdom was her courage and involving others was her strength. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of the fairy-tale is the situation created by the wise little girl – once the entranced creatures of the witch, who had totally surrendered their existence to her, were empowered by Vasilisa, Baba-Yaga could not scare them.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Managers are more powerful than those at the ‘top. Many do not know this fact. When they realize this, the Baba-Yagas do not scare them. </em></p>
