		<p>The Pygmalion bosses are very caring and very loving but keep the bar of expectation from their people quite high.</p>
		<p>Who are the Pygmalion Bosses? For this, first we must know who was ‘Pygmalion’!</p>
		<p>In Greek mythology, Pygmalion was a passionate sculptor. He was the King of Cyprus.</p>
		<p>For some reason, Pygmalion avoided women. In fact, he vowed never to marry. Pygmalion used his wonderful skills to make a statue of a woman in ivory. It was so beautiful that no living woman could match its beauty. He gave it the name Galatea. Pygmalion fell in love with his own creation. During the festival of worship for Goddess Aphrodite, Pygmalion fervently beseeched the Goddess to grant life to the lifeless Galatea, his true love. His prayers were so passionate that Aphrodite accepted his prayers and breathed life into the statue. Galatea became a real, beautiful woman. Pygmalion married her and both lived happily ever after.</p>
		<p>‘Pygmalion Effect’ has become a management metaphor – You get what you expect! Management mavens believe that expectations determine the outcome, not sometimes, always! Many experiments were conducted and it was proved that ‘expectations’ get the matching results. If the boss expects less, people perform less. But if the boss’s expectations are high, people try their best to raise their performance to match their boss’s expectations. The following are the central tenets of the Pygmalion Effect:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What the boss expects from his subordinates and the way he treats them largely determines the subordinates’ performance and career progress. </li>
			<li>A unique characteristic of a superior boss is the ability to create ‘high performance expectations’ that subordinates fulfil. </li>
			<li>Less effective boss fails to develop high expectations and as a consequence of this, the productivity and output of his subordinates suffer. </li>
			<li>Subordinates, like soldiers, more often than not, appear to do what they believe their boss expects them to do. </li>
			<li>The first boss matters. If the first boss is a ‘Pygmalion’ boss, people grow with a loving heart, and they grow up to be Pygmalion bosses. But if the first boss is a Gotcha boss, the subordinates also grow to be Gotcha bosses. Lucky are those who begin their career with Pygmalion bosses; unlucky are those who start their career with Gotcha bosses. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>I am lucky to have had many Pygmalion Bosses.</p>
		<p>AS Chatrath, the Chief Engineer of Baira Siul Project during my NHPC assignment, was a person who assessed my potential. He knew my capabilities which I never thought I possessed. His expectations were so high that many a time I became nervous and thought that ‘this time I will fail’. But he motivated the energy in me in his own way and I used this energy to fly to the height he wanted me to reach. What I am today, I owe it to AS Chatrath – the Pied-piper! He was a tough and demanding boss.</p>
		<p>My second Pygmalion boss was HR Alva, Director HR, HMT. He never gave me an order or instructions. He just used to whisper what he was expecting from me. He was highly supportive and caring. I do not remember ever disappointing him. Like Pygmalion, he expected to get only the best. Like Galatea, I had to be at my best. Unlike AS Chatrath, HR Alva was very soft but highly demanding. Both had their own individual styles of expecting and getting the best from me.</p>
		<p>My third Pygmalion boss was N Ramanuja, Chairman and Managing Director of HMT. He was a born Pygmalion – a very transparent boss. He had high levels of energy and a very loving heart. Although he was the Chairman, and I was only a General Manager (HR), he never treated me as his subordinate. He never called me Siddiqui or Mr Siddiqui. He always used to call me ‘Siddiqui Saheb’. Even today, whenever I meet him or have a chat with him over the phone, he always begins with, ‘Siddiqui Saheb, how are you?’ Unlike both AS Chatrath and HR Alva, he was neither hard nor soft nor demanding; he would just tell you what he expects and stand beside you like a rock to give his full support. No wonder I have never disappointed him.</p>
		<p>Among my Pygmalion bosses, I would also include MK Jaura's name. When for the first time I was given the corporate assignment to manage HR at the macro-level in a premier public sector organization, my boss, MK Jaura, gave me two tips: (1) Never do backseat driving (2) Give credit to your people. In the first day sermon he said, “All through your career you have learnt to face and tackle the problems directly. One way to look at it is like steering the car while sitting in the driver’s seat. But now you are in the corporate office. Remember, there can’t be two persons in the driver’s seat. It is time for you to take the back seat and allow the driver to steer.” He further added, “Your job is to keep your expectations from your SBU people high; share your expectations with them. Keep their morale high and you will see that they live up to what you expected from them.” At that point of time, I did not understand his words. Today, as the author of the popular book, ‘The Pygmalion Manager’ and a course-Director of a 3-day workshop on the same theme, I understand the power of expectations. We tend to opt for backseat driving for we do not trust the guy sitting in the driver’s seat. Our job is to honestly share our expectations and allow the person to drive the car using his or her own driving skills.</p>
		<p>The other lesson that I learnt from MK Jaura was how to grant ‘authentic Empowerment’ to our people. On the very first day, he made his credo clear to me. He told me, looking directly into my eyes, “Moid, this place is new and you will encounter many types of bosses. Listen. When something works out fine, say, ‘I have done it’ and if it misfires say, ‘my boss had asked me to do so’. Take the credit when things work out smoothly ; shift the blame to me when things go wrong.” I was looking at him wondering how to respond. Finally, I did not say anything. Let me confess, many a time he took discredit boldly with a large heart when things misfired due to my mishandling of situations. Credit came to me even for the work which was actually done by my boss.</p>
		<p>Later, when I became the corporate HR boss, I followed the credo that I had inherited from my boss: if something goes wrong, it is my fault; if something turns out great, he or she did it. Give credit to your people. “The group will not prosper if the leader grabs the lion’s share of the credit for good work that has been done,” cautions Lao Tzu, a well-known philosopher from Ancient China. The Pygmalion bosses know the art of managing from within which is different from the conventional management methods. Do not dominate, manifest. I could acquire and develop some traits of Pygmalion because some of my bosses were themselves great <em>Pygmalions</em>.</p>
		<p>“I will tell you what makes a great manager,” shares Reggie Jackson. “A great manager has a knack for making ballplayers think they are better than they think they are. He forces you to have a good opinion of yourself. He lets you know he believes in you. He makes you get more out of yourself. And once you learn how good you really are, you never settle for playing anything less than your very best.” So, help create a positive, strong, mental makeup.</p>
		<p>Remember, Pygmalion bosses are very passionate, loving and caring people. They support and restore confidence in one’s ‘self’. They do this magic through the power of ‘Expectations’, believing firmly that ‘you get what you expect!”</p>
		<p>Forming expectations are natural and unavoidable. High expectations lead to high performance; low expectations lead to low performance. Better performance resulting from ‘high expectations’ makes the leader like his people more. Lower performance, resulting from ‘low expectations’, makes the leader like his people less. The boss tends to feel uncomfortable with people who do not meet his expectations, whether high or low.</p>
		<p>Pygmalion Management is all about expectations – high and low. The end-result is the outcome of these expectations. What the boss expects from his subordinates and the way he treats them largely determines on his subordinates’ performance. A unique characteristic of a superior boss is his ability to create high performance expectations that subordinates ultimately fulfil. Less effective boss fails to develop high expectations, and as a consequence, the subordinates realize a lower output. Subordinates, more often that not, appear to do what they believe they are expected to do.</p>
		<p>Pygmalion bosses know how to get the best from their people. They make their people become Galatea. When Pygmalion expected Galatea to acquire life, Galatea lived up to his expectations when God made her a living being. Thus, as a Pygmalion boss you must know how to get the best from your people. And as a Galatea subordinate you must know how to give off your best to meet the expectations of your boss and the organization.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> Create in yourself a Pygmalion first. If you want your people to perform better, simply raise the bar of your expectations articulately, honestly and in a supporting spirit. But keep the bar of appreciation low – praise them even for small achievements. </em></p>
