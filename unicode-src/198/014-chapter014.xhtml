		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">14. </span>The Achiever</h1>
		<p>The Achievers are achievers, subordinates, managers, bosses or the CEO of an organization. ‘Achievers’ are a different variety altogether. For this reason I am not suffixing the noun ‘Boss’. The achiever is always an achiever; the hierarchical status makes little difference.</p>
		<p>Achievers look for achievements. Their achievements are the real motivating force for them – recognition of their achievements are more motivating than some monetary award. They do not work for career-growth; career-growth is bound to happen if they prove by their actions that they are achievers. It comes by default, as a by-product of their contribution. Achieving their aim gives them greater personal satisfaction than receiving praise or recognition. Neither job security nor status is the prime motivator for them. They seek constant improvement on the principle ‘Better your Yesterday’ and ‘Better the Best’. They are very logical in their approach.</p>
		<p>As mentioned, ‘achievement’ is the key driver for the Achievers. They are very realistic – they always keep their feet on the ground and understand ground realities. ‘Challenging goals’ excite them. They seek advancement in career proving their capabilities and giving results. Yet, more than career advancement, the sense of accomplishment gives them the utmost satisfaction.</p>
		<p>The achievers enjoy ‘doing something not done before’. They also enjoy ‘successful completion of difficult and challenging tasks’. They look for achieving success by ability rather than by chance. If they get success by chance, they refuse to take the credit and never relish such a success. They can perform only those tasks with make ‘sense’ to them and has ‘meaning’ for them. They are highly organized and they expect their people to be fully organized.</p>
		<p>At this point, when I look back to identify my achiever bosses whose profile and success stories can be quoted, a tall personality comes to my mind, again and again. I thought of postponing the citation about him in the beginning because he was not my boss. However, as his characteristic traits are in sync with what I have stated it would do injustice to this chapter if I spoke about him at the end and not at the beginning.</p>
		<p>A person who perfectly fits into the mould of an ‘Achiever’ is RH Khwaja. I know him for the last one decade, from the time he was the Chairman and Managing Director of SCCL – Singareni Collieries Company Limited. He is an IAS officer, but I will not call him a ‘bureaucrat’ because he possesses high-quality entrepreneurship competencies. Later, he went back to assist the Government of India as Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests. Currently he is the Union Tourism Secretary, Government of India (He has been recently posted as Secretary, Ministry of Mines, Government of India). I have a very good relationship with him – more profound than a blood relationship. He is the co-author of my tenth Management book, “The Acrobatics of Change”, which is targeted for a sale of over 10,000 copies.</p>
		<p>I know all about Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) and its working culture. Before I met RH Khwaja, SCCL was one of our prestigious clients when I was the Director (HR) in Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML). As a public sector person, I knew SCCL was one of the toughest mining companies to work in. Later, when I floated my own consulting company ‘Intellects Biz’, SCCL had welcomed me and sought my assistance for conducting workshops at their different mining complexes.</p>
		<p>My meeting with RH Khwaja was accidental. Once I had received a call from the former Group General Manager, HR, SCCL. He wanted me to conduct a retreat in which his Chairman, Directors, and top team would participate. He wanted me to keep the ‘Balanced Scorecard’ as the central theme. When he shared with me that his CEO was from the IAS, I gave him some convincing excuses to avoid the assignment. Bureaucracy and I do not gel together. Even as a Director (HR) of a public sector company, I could never establish a heart-to-heart relationship with my <em>sarkari </em>bosses – the bureaucrats.</p>
		<p>The HR Chief, however, was persistent, and I could not find an escape route. I met RH Khwaja for the first time at the resort where the retreat was organized. The whole day he remained on my mental scanner. I was watching him from all angles. Externally he seemed tough but his inner core was very soft. He was a highly disciplined person with great humility. I found him hard like a coconut shell on the outside and soft as its inner kernel.</p>
		<p>Later I met Khwaja Saheb many times. To my mind, he is a great entrepreneur with qualities of ‘performing’ leadership. He is one of the great achievers I have met and worked with. He is highly focussed with a sharp memory. He took SCCL to greater heights yet gave wholehearted credit to his predecessors and his people for the turnaround. I am witness to many turnarounds. I have also read many turnaround stories. But this is a mining company which suffered many ailments -from Union militancy to Naxalite insurgency in those areas where its mining projects are located. One can use one’s leadership skills for taming the Union and managing good industrial relations. But how can one fight or negotiate with those who know only one language – terrorise and get your demands fulfilled? Managing such a mining company was itself a Herculean task, let alone taking it to greater heights and making it profitable and breaking all the performance records of the past. He could do this by managing from the heart.</p>
		<p>Those who have read his ‘The Singareni Love Story’, the second part of the book ‘The Acrobatics of Change’, will appreciate the hardships, delicacies and the challenges involved in such turnarounds. ‘The turnaround, as they call it, was my romance with nature and the people of Singareni who have now got an identity as <em>Singarenians</em>’. He created ‘bonding’ among the Singarenians by not only giving them a unique identity but also wisdom through his slogan: ‘One Family; One Vision; One Mission’! While sharing the story of success, he did recognize the contribution of his predecessor, APVN Sarma, calling him ‘a bold and visionary leader’. He gave the lion’s share of success to his team, not in a generic or cursory manner, but by mentioning each name and that person’s contribution in the turnaround.</p>
		<p>“I was deeply touched to see the inherent optimism, sincerity and dedication of our underground workers when I inspected the mines. I promised myself that I would try my best to improve their working conditions. After all our underground workers constitute the backbone of coal mining operations in SCCL,” he correctly observed. He located the backbone of the organization, considered its worth and determined to strengthen it so as to strengthen the entire organization.</p>
		<p>His Achiever’s characteristics come out clearly when he writes, “Yes, my ‘quiet conscience’ was making me stronger. I could feel that. My enthusiasm was getting renewed with each cockcrow. I felt a strange soothing effect in my heart and a new happiness which was until now unknown to me.” This is what I have mentioned in the beginning of this chapter – the real achiever is inspired by his achievements and results, not by monetary rewards or material gains.</p>
		<p>As you will find out later, one of the deficiencies which has been assigned to achievers by many management Gurus, including David Clarence McClelland who is known for discovering three motivational drivers of leaders, is low-ebb on the HR front. It is believed that since the Achievers are highly focused and result oriented, many times they fail on the ‘human front’. Yet, there is a very insignificant minority of Achievers that works well on both fronts – results and people. RH Khwaja falls in the category of this insignificant minority. He is a high achiever with a humane heart. He is very vibrant and vigorous in his efforts yet very humble and kind to people.</p>
		<p>Against this backdrop, I will place RH Khwaja at a level a bit higher than Achievers – at level 5 of Leadership. As mentioned, many Achievers suffer from certain weaknesses. Though Achievers are very good in getting results, many times they get it by compromising with human aspects. However, Khwaja Saheb is a paradoxical blend of ‘personal humility’ and ‘professional will’.</p>
		<p>“We are surprised, shocked really, to discover type of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one,” writes Jim Collins in his book ‘Good to Great’. “Compared to high-profile leaders with big personalities who make headlines and become celebrities, the good-to-great leaders seem to have come from Mars. Self-effacing, quiet, reserved, even shy.” Their recognition is the paradoxical combination of ‘humility’ and ‘will’. Most interestingly, the level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves. It is not that level 5 leaders have no ego or self-interest; they do have it. But they subordinate the self interest to their goals and objectives. For them, their ‘ambition’ is first and foremost for the company or institution, not for themselves. Level 5 leaders build enduring <span>greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. All those companies who have witnessed a turnaround had ‘level 5’ leadership at the time of transition. These leaders are different kind of achievers – they cut against the grain of conventional wisdom, They discard the belief that we need ‘largerthan-life’ saviours with big personalities to transform companies. They are practical people. They are role models – strong-willed, humble and fearless. Khwaja Saheb possesses all these leadership traits. </span></p>
		<p>Assertiveness with humility is a very rare leadership trait — the leadership of the 21st century belongs to those who are unstoppable yet humble and kind.</p>
		<p>Achievers live up to the challenging situations – they love challenges and put their mind, heart and soul to grab success. Now let me write something about one of my bosses whom I consider to be a great Achiever boss.</p>
		<p>The Himalayas have nostalgic memories for me. I found the valley the native place of wisdom. I do not refer here to the <em>yogis</em> or <em>saints;</em> I going to tell you the real story of a high achiever. He was HC Bharadwaj, Superintendent Engineer of NHPC – National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation. The place was the Baira Siul project in the Himalayas.</p>
		<p>I recall, it was an unprecedented cold winter when the fury of weather brought destruction where I was working as Manager (Personnel) during the mid- seventies of the preceding century. One of our sites – Tissa Dam – was totally cut off by landslides. It was just a chance factor that the senior-most person available at the Headquarters in the valley for taking crucial decisions at such a stressful time was a Superintendent Engineer, ranked equal to a Deputy General Manager in terms of conventional hierarchy.</p>
		<p>The very first step that HC Bharadawaj took was that he shifted his place of operation from his carpeted, well-structured and safe room to a wireless control room which was located in the landslides zone. This jacked up the morale of the project people. He demonstrated his risk by flexing his muscles and fearlessness.</p>
		<p>“Most of the workers and their families are rendered homeless” was the first problem posted to him by wireless from the Tissa Dam Site</p>
		<p>“Convert all the official complexes into rehabilitation centres, not only for our workers but also for the <em>Pahadis </em>(people who live on the mountains) who have been rendered homeless” was HC Bharadawaj’s decision given without any hesitation.</p>
		<p>“The grief-stricken families need medicines.” This problem was posed to him the next day.</p>
		<p>“Take medicines from the project medical stores even for those villagers who are not eligible under the company’s policy,” he ordered – a quick and bold decision.</p>
		<p>“The store is locked. The pharmacist is not traceable for the past two days. Yet a private doctor is available who is willing to render his services voluntarily. “</p>
		<p>“Break open the medical store,” was his precise and firm reply, demonstrating that the executive exists to make sensible exceptions to the general rule. “Let the private practitioner decide upon the distribution of medicines free of charge. See, our objective is to save lives.”</p>
		<p>“There is no improvement in the weather conditions. Our ration is exhausting fast. We are afraid that many people, especially the children, may die of hunger.” This problem was posed to him on the 7th day.</p>
		<p>“Take the rations from the officers’ houses who are away on leave or tour.”</p>
		<p>“Their houses are locked,” said the voice on the wireless, shaky with fear and not from the piercing cold of the winter wind.</p>
		<p>“Break open the houses,” retorted HC Bharadawaj, coolly. This fearless decision broke all the norms of management and civil administration.</p>
		<p>“It will be an illegal act,” said the voice on wireless, nervously.</p>
		<p>“Don’t bother about legality, I take full responsibility. I repeat – break open the locks and take all the ration available in those houses.” His orders were absolutely clear – he did not mince his words nor did he give any pause to the count of ten.</p>
		<p>Later, HC Bharadawaj organized aerial food drop by seeking the assistance from the Air Force and other decisive action much beyond his delegation of powers.</p>
		<p>Under the ‘play safe’ strategic environment, widespread in most of the companies today, the saga of professional bravery exhibited by these type of leaders appear to be like fairy tales. Let me hasten to add that Peter Block’s <em>Empowerment</em> was not known to the leaders of those days.</p>
		<p>This is a true story of an achiever which has taught me the wisdom: Unusual situations can be dealt only with unusual decisions. One cannot fish for a whale by using an angling rod!</p>
		<p>Achievers are risk-takers but they take a very calculated risk. But here was an achiever, who took on risks to the extent that he could have been jailed. Later, when the papers went to the Chairman, NHPC, for obtaining his ex-post-facto sanction, the Director (Finance) raised objections about whether a manager could take such important decisions, involving huge financial commitments, on his own authority. He suggested that an explanation be sought before the case was processed. But when the file went to the Chairman and Managing Director, he wrote, “I overrule the observations of Director (Finance) and grant ex-post-facto approval. I wish my managers must follow the spirit of Mr HC Bharadwaj.” He was Major General TV Jagannathan, PVSM &#38; AVSM (Retired), a renowned military man who was decorated with many gallantry awards during his active stint in the Army.</p>
		<p>The Achievers are not gamblers. They watch, assess, analyse and take a highly ‘calculated’ risk. No wonder that in ‘risk-taking’ their success rate is very high.</p>
		<p>Following are some of the specific characteristics of Achievers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Doing something not done before </li>
			<li>Successful completion of difficult tasks </li>
			<li>Achieving success by ability rather than by chance or factors beyond their control </li>
			<li>Preferring jobs where they can meet the objective </li>
			<li>Achieving goals individually rather than through team-effort </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Many management Gurus have mentioned that one of the major problems with many Achievers is that they are so focused and overwhelmed about their achievements and targets that many a time they compromise on human aspects and social relationships. But the great Achievers are those who are not only focused on their goals but also care for human aspects while achieving the result.</p>
		<p>The Achievers want to prove their individual capabilities. They want to achieve by proving their own competence and worth, and therefore, some of them prefer an individualistic approach rather than a collective approach. But the real Achievers take care of their people and build up their teams. They are indeed a very rare species!</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em><strong>Master Tip:</strong> As a tiger will never eat the grass, the Achiever will never let the project or mission fail. As the Singaporeans say in ‘Singlish’, “Die, die, must do”, the Achievers will never leave their mission unfulfilled. They are ‘unstoppable’. </em></p>
