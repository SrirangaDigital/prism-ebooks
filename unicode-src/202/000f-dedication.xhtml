		<p class="myquote"><em>“The highest truth is this: God is present in all beings. They are his multiple forms. There is no other God to seek… It is a man making religion that we want… Give up these wakening mysticisms and be strong… For the next fifty years… let all other Gods disappear from our minds. This is the only God that is awake, our own race, everywhere. His hands everywhere, his feet everywhere his ears; He covers everything….The first of all worships is the worship of these all around us…He alone serves God who serves all other beings.”</em></p>
