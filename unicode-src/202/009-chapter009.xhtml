		<p><span class="bigletter">T</span>he reasons and excuses for our slow growth or under achievement for these many years are dime and dozen.</p>
		<p>Few of them attribute to the colonial rule that we were subjected to for more than three centuries, some of them point to our society divided on caste, creed, religion, economy and lack of co-operation and few others accuse the lack of application of science and technology in the early years of our independence. Yes, all the above and few other reasons may have impacted our journey of growth but what is more shocking and disappointing is when people surrender accepting all this as one’s fate and God’s will.</p>
