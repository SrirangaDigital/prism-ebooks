		<p>The whole world is passing through an Energy crisis. Some countries more than others.</p>
		<p>India has an acute shortage of energy and it is likely to get worse if we do not do something soon.</p>
		<p>Almost all the energy that we use now came from the sun. It has been flowing in over billions of years ever since the earth spilled out of the sun and started orbiting round it.</p>
		<p>Some of that energy has been stored inside the earth as what are called fossil fuels. Coal, oil and gas are the main fossil fuels that were stored under the surface of the earth.</p>
		<p>Life has grown in this planet of ours by sheer accidental combination of events that were favourable for the growth of life. We are very fortunate that every thing was right. We have the right temperature, right atmosphere, plenty of water, right magnetic field to ward off harmful radiations that destroy life. It is near miracle that humans evolved, humans who have large enough brains to think, to learn, to create, to love but sadly to hate also. We have tried to make our lives comfortable through various inventions but in the process squandered what the earth had stored for us.</p>
		<p>Some sources of energy cannot be renewed once we have used them up and the store has been getting emptier. These are non-renewable energy like coal and oil that took millions of years to be processed and stored. There are others which are constantly renewed like solar energy and all other forms of energy like wind and rain that solar energy gives rise to. It would be good to know how different sources of energy were formed and how we learnt to make use of them. Stories of these discoveries are always exciting. It will also be interesting to learn about the inside of the earth and the atmosphere that shields us, and protected in this comfortable planet of ours, how restless human minds invented the ways to live in greater comfort, to light up the dark nights and travel faster and faster.</p>
		<p>All these endeavours use up energy and we have waken, rather late, not only to control our energy use from fossils but also use “Alternative forms of energy” that are constantly renewed and will not run out like fossil fuels.</p>
