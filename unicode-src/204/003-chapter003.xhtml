		<img src="images/008.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>It is only a star, our sun. One of many billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky-Way which is one of many billions of galaxies in this universe, created, as is postulated, after a <em>big bang</em> about 13.7 billion years ago.<em> </em>Ever since then the universe is expanding, the galaxies are moving away from each other. That is another exciting story.</p>
		<p>Let us now focus our attention on our sun, the provider of heat and light for the small planet that we inhabit and also the gravitational pull that keeps the earth orbiting round the sun along an almost elliptical path.</p>
		<p>The sun is a fiery mass of gas made mostly of hydrogen (94%) and helium (6%). Its diameter is 1,391,980 km, 109 times larger than the earth. The temperature of the surface of the sun is about 5200&#9900;C. Rays of heat and light radiate continuously from there. Where does the sun get so much energy? We shall come to that story when we discuss nuclear fusion.</p>
		<p>Let us remember that heat, light, ultra violet and various cosmic rays belong to the same family of electromagnetic waves that James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79), the great Scottish physicist had mathematically shown to exist all over the universe and they all have the same incredibly large speed of 300,000 km per second. Out of the entire spectrum of Electromagnetic waves, visible light is a tiny section, extending as you know from red to violet. The distance between the peaks of two successive crests or troughs (or one cycle of a wave) is the wavelength and frequency is a measure of how many times the wave oscillates in a second. In the visible spectrum, red has the longest wave length (700 nm) and violet has the shortest length (400 nm), nm is nanometre which is one billionth of a metre.</p>

		<p>(Sound waves do not come in this category. Sound waves are much slower,340 metres per second and need a medium to carry them. Light waves can pass through vacuum.)</p>
		<p>Heat is the Infra red section that we can feel but cannot see. Its wavelength is larger than that of red and its frequency is lesser. Out of the total electromagnetic radiation that reaches the earth approximately 45% reaches us as infrared or heat, 53% as visible light and about 2% as other rays. Ultra violet rays that are harmful for us are largely trapped by a layer of ozone that surrounds the earth and we shall study how earth’s magnetism helps to deflect other harmful cosmic rays. In sum, the earth receives light and heat enough for life to grow and thrive.</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) -</strong> A great Scottish Mathematician, Maxwell is classed with Galileo, Newton and Einstein as one of the four greatest physicists of the world.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Born to an aristocratic family of Scotland, he initially studied at home and when he joined school, he was somewhat lonely. His mathematical talents were soon recognized, especially after he won the school medal when he was barely 13 years old. His main education was in the University of Edinburgh under the tutelage of scientists like Sir William Hamilton and Professor Thompson.</p>
		<p class="myquote">He had made major contributions to subjects like Heat and Thermodynamics but the most profound contribution that Maxwell made to Physics was his publication of “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.” He showed mathematically from some experimental results already published, that oscillations of electric and magnetic fields produce Electromagnetic waves that travel at a speed of 310,740 km/sec, much too close to the speed of light known at that time and he derived, with the help of his equations that light was also a section of electromagnetic waves and so are radio waves, as was experimentally proven by Heinrich Hertz and Jagadish Chandra Bose. This discovery has been termed as the second great unification in Physics after Newton’s Laws. Maxwell’s discoveries helped to usher in the era of modern physics laying the foundation for such fields as the Special Theory of Relativity and Quantum mechanics. According to Richard Feynman, Maxwell’s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics was the most important event of the 19 th century.</p>
		<p class="myquote">Maxwell served as a Professor in the University of Aberdeen and King’s College, London during early years of his life and became the first Cavendish Professor at Cambridge. He had very high regard for Michael Faraday whose experimental results helped his derivation of Electromagnetic Theory. Faraday, forty years his senior, had high regard for Maxwell also. Maxwell died young, like his mother, at the age of 48 from abdominal cancer in the year 1879.</p>

		<p>Is it not amazing that in this vast Universe of countless galaxies and stars, there exists this tiny planet of ours receiving the right amount of energy from a star that helped the growth of bacteria,vegetation and other living beings including all of us?</p>
		<p>And we are made of tiny molecules, tinier atoms and we live and think and we are conscious! Next time you go to a beach and see the vast spread of sand, take a handful. You may have picked up billions of grains of sand. Let all the sand run through your fingers and take a look at just one grain. If that single grain is our earth then all the sand around you may be imagined to represent this universe. I know it is a crude analogy but just a way to comprehend our insignificance in the cosmic vastness.</p>
