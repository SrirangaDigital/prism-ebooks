		<p>A short piece of thin magnet, suspended from a string or supported on a pivot makes a magnetic compass which is believed to be a Chinese invention.</p>
		<p>It changed the face of Western Europe and subsequently of the world. Lode stones having magnetic properties were known earlier and there were many myths associated with lode stones.</p>
		<p>Europe was emerging in twelfth- thirteenth century A.D. from the Dark age that followed the glories of Greco-Roman civilization.</p>

		<p>Sea voyages beckoned but they were not safe.</p>
		<p>Imagine a ship, out in the Atlantic, with nothing to guide the sailors except the pole star or some other stars.</p>
		<p>On an overcast night, there was no guiding star in view for the ancient navigators. Magnetic compasses came to their rescue. The Italian born Spanish explorer Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) sailed westward in the quest of the spice rich India and landed in America and that is how the West was discovered.</p>
		<p>Vasco da Gama (1460-1524), the Portuguese explorer, succeeded in reaching India. Sea voyages increasingly became common and combined with the invention of fire arms (also a Chinese invention) led to colonization and brought a lot of wealth to Western Europe. Universities were set up as centres of knowledge. An illustrious product of Cambridge in England, during the realm of Queen Elizabeth 1, was William Gilbert. (1544-1603)</p>
		<p>Gilbert was a physician by training and profession. Physics was his hobby. Because of his great reputation in medical practice, he was appointed the queen’s personal physician.</p>
		<p>Dr. Gilbert seldom accepted myths and he asked basic questions.</p>
		<p>One of the questions that bothered him was why should a compass needle point towards the North and South direction? He also observed that the needle was not horizontal. It dipped. The farther north he went the more it dipped.</p>
		<p>“Is the earth itself a magnet?” asked Gilbert. He made a spherical magnet, called it “Terrella” and got a very tiny compass made. He observed that this tiny magnet behaved much the same way on the surface of the Terrella as an ordinary magnetic compass does on the surface of the earth. The tiny magnet pointed towards the poles of the spherical magnet and also dipped. At the poles the needle dipped by 90 degrees. His experiments proved quite convincingly that the earth is indeed a magnet but Gilbert did not, at that time, have an answer to the question of what makes the earth a magnet.</p>
		<p>His book “<em>de magnete</em>” published in the year 1600, was an excellent scientific treatise and is still considered to be an outstanding study on magnets and static charges considering the time when it was written.</p>
		<p>“What makes the earth a magnet?” The answer to this question is linked to what you learnt in the previous article. Remember you had learnt that the earth has a solid core and around it flows a thick layer of molten nickel and iron? The core of the earth is a magnet and a very strong one at that. This magnet produces what is known to be a magnetic field. This field <em>deflects</em> some of the harmful rays that come from the sun during solar flares. If the earth were not a magnet and these cosmic rays were to reach the earth, would life have been possible?</p>
		<p><strong><em>Every thing seems to have been just right on this planet of ours so that life could start and we could evolve!.</em></strong></p>
		<p>In this chapter, we have written about William Gilbert at some length, since he was described as the father of electricity and magnetism. Queen Elizabeth liked her physician and admired his talents. She bequeathed a substantial amount of money to Dr. Gilbert to help set up a good library and laboratory. Gilbert continued as a Royal physician after the queen’s death in 1603. But not too long.</p>
		<p>He fell a victim to Bubonic plague (1603) and sadly, his library and laboratory perished in the Great London Fire (1666).</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> (31 October 1451 – 20 May 1506) was an explorer, navigator, and colonizer, born in the Republic of Genoa, in what is today northwestern Italy. He completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general European awareness of the American continents. Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola, initiated the process of genocide and Spanish colonization, which foreshadowed the general European colonization  of what became known as the “New World”.</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>D.  Vasco da Gama </strong>(1460 - 1524), 1<sup>st</sup> Count of Vidigueira, was a Portuguese explorer, one of the most successful in the Age of Discovery  and the commander of the first ships to sail directly from Europe  to India. He is one of the most famous and celebrated explorers, being the first European to reach India  through sea. For his contributions he was named as the Governor of India, under the title of Viceroy, and given the newly created County of Vidigueira  in 1519.</p>
