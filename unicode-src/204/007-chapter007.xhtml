		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">THE BLUE FIRMAMENT THAT SHIELDS US</h1>
		<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>It is a sphere of air and vapour. In fact that is the origin of the word <em>atmosphere</em> in Greek. (<em>atmos &#126; vapour, sphaira &#126; ball</em>). It is like a 4.5 meter thick concrete roof over this earth protecting us from all hazards that may come from the outer space, like harmful rays and meteors and keeps us nicely warm from freezing at -50&#9900;C, the temperature in the outer space. The gravitational pull of the earth prevents the gases from flying away since the earth keeps spinning at about 1675 km an hour at the equator, to go one round of nearly 40,000 km, the perimeter of the earth at the equator, in 24 hours. There is almost no matter in the space, no friction and the earth has not slowed down over billions of years. Remember Newton’s first law about inertia of rest and inertia of motion? It states “<em>Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by an external impressed force to change that state.</em>” If you kick a ball it comes to rest because friction causes it to stop.</p>

		<p>The outer space is dark and cold although the electromagnetic waves, the visible light and the invisible infrared and other rays from the sun pass through the space. There is hardly any matter to reflect the light and make it visible since we see things only in reflected light. There is very little matter to absorb the heat, get warm and exchange heat.</p>
		<p>The atmosphere is divided broadly into four unequal parts.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">TROPOSPHERE</h2>
			<p>The <em>Troposphere </em>stretches from sea level to about 16 km on the equator and 6 km on the poles, <em>an average </em>of 10km. This is the most important part of the atmosphere for us. This is where the clouds are formed, gases and water vapour get mixed (In Greek <em>trope </em>means overturn and that is what happens when the gases keep turning over) and provide the right combination of air for us with 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, argon, carbondioxide, water vapour and trace gases all adding up to about 1%. Jet planes usually fly at a height of 10km where the density of air is less than half of the density at sea level , the friction is less and less fuel is consumed. Turbulence is also minimum here.</p>

			<p>We hardly ever realize that we are at the bottom of an ocean of air which exerts a pressure of about 1kg per square centimetre on us at sea level, reducing as we go up. The force on your stretched palm due to the weight of the air would be about 125kgs. You do not feel the force because there is an equal and opposite force on the back of your palm cancelling it.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">STRATOSPHERE</h2>
			<p>Beyond the Troposphere is the <em>Stratosphere </em>which stretches up to about 50 km. Nearly 90% of the ozone in the atmosphere is concentrated in this section and helps to protect us from the harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>

		<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.03">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">MESOSPHERE</h2>
			<p>The mesosphere stretches up to about 85km above sea level. This is where most meteors burn out due to friction on entering the atmosphere and it saves us from being bombarded by meteors.</p>
			<p>The space shuttles have to be carefully monitored as they enter the atmosphere at about 17000 miles per hour, the temperature rising to about 1500&#9900;C due to friction and only specially made material can withstand such a temperature.</p>
			<p>In the year 2003 the Columbia Space shuttle burnt out because of some fault and that is when Kalpana Chawla, the Indian Astronaut, lost her life.</p>

		<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-007.04">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">THERMOSPHERE</h2>
			<p>The thermosphere stretches up to about 700 km. The air is highly rarefied here. The International space station orbits in this layer at about 320 - 380 km. This is where the <em>IONOSPHERE is mainly located.</em> This is where the atoms get <em>ionized</em> or electrically charged due to solar radiation (UV light).The Ionosphere helps to reflect long and medium range radio waves and send them around the curved surface of the earth.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Why is the sky blue?</h2>
			<p>We cannot complete this article without briefly answering this question that often come to mind.</p>
			<p>We have discussed electromagnetic rays and visible light which we all know is a spectrum of <em>VIBGYOR </em>When light waves pass through gas atoms and molecules they get scattered. Shorter the waves length the larger is the scattering.</p>
			<p>Larger the wavelength lesser is the scattering.</p>
			<p>Have you ever wondered why all danger signals are red?</p>
			<p>Red waves being the longest visible wave are least scattered and can travel longer distances just as water waves in an ocean. Small water waves break down easily but long waves can travel long distances.</p>
			<p>As white light comes directly from the sun, and meets with gas atoms and molecules up above, the violet and blue get scattered early and blue reaches our eyes from all directions of the dome giving the impression of a blue sky.When the sun sets, the sun being on the horizon, the solar rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere. Most colours get scattered and initially the western sky looks yellow and when the sun is further down and looks like an ellipse (do find out why), orange and red reach our eyes and make some sunsets so rich and resplendent.</p>
