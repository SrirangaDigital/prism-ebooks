		<p>If you travel about 325km from Bangalore, either to the east or to the west you will see the blue seas. You see the Bay of Bengal if you go east and the Arabian sea if you travel west. They appear endless and seem to meet the sky in the horizon.</p>
		<p>Winds sweep across them. Waves rise and keep rolling in and crashing on the shores. Surely, you know that oceans cover 70% of the earth and land mass covers barely 30%. From sea levels land may rise as mountains. Mount Everest stretches up to about 8.8km. The average depth of the oceans is about 3.5 km going as deep as 6 km at places. The Atlantic and the Pacific are the largest oceans and of course there are the Indian Ocean, Baltic ocean and a few others. The Pacific Ocean alone covers the same area as the land on earth. Nearly 97% of all the water is contained in the oceans, about 1.6% in the glaciers and ice caps and the rest in rivers and lakes and in the clouds.</p>

		<p>Where did all this water come from? That is not an easy question to answer. It was believed earlier that the oceans must have originated from the steam in the atmosphere. As the earth cooled it rained for thousands of years and the oceans were formed. It was found later that the oceans hold much more water than the atmosphere could possibly provide.</p>
		<p>It was then believed that under compression enough water came out of the mantle of the earth made of liquid rocks. Moisture from the molten rocks in the earth moved up and cooled and then it rained continuously and filled the craters to make the oceans. This is not believed to be entirely true either.</p>
		<p>It was believed earlier that the moon has no water. Chandrayan, the Indian satellite sent to the moon detected the presence of water in the moon. Where did this water come from? The moon, because of its low gravitational attraction, does not have an atmosphere and it is constantly bombarded by celestial bodies. A number of scientists believe that water came to the moon, the distant planets of the solar system, in some of the moons in the Jupiter primarily from Comets and debris from space that constantly bombard the planets and the moons. Some water in our moon must have come with the matter that came from the earth.</p>
		<p>Water on the earth, it is now believed, came primarily from outside. This is plausible since after the supernova explosion, stars in our galaxy and planets were formed from celestial debris. The volume of the earth is 800 times the volume of water in the oceans. If the earth could be formed from debris from space, so could the oceans. (<em>see the news item below</em>)</p>
		<p>Water has many strange properties. For example, most liquids contract when they freeze, or the volume of the solid is lesser than its liquid form. Surprisingly, water contracts to its minimum volume at 4&#9900;C and then there is a sudden reversal and it expands, reaching a volume 10% higher than liquid water as it freezes into ice at 0&#9900;C In other words, ice is lighter than water and therefore it floats in water. Would you believe that this freak of Nature has enabled the earth to nurture life? If ice was heavier than water, it would sink. The bottom of the oceans would begin to get filled with ice and there would not be any floating ice blocks to keep the oceans reasonably warm for marine life to thrive. Had there been no marine life could life on earth ever begin? The surface of water is, however, warmer than it is deep down. At the tropics there may be a difference of 20 -25&#9900;C. This may be exploited for extracting energy.</p>
		<p>Sea water, as we know is saline, and we cannot drink it. If you keep boiling sea water you would be left with common salt, which is sodium chloride.</p>
		<p>If we drink sea water there would be excess salt in our system. That would eventually break up the cells that make our body and we would die. Many sea farers stranded in the oceans have died without water. Less salt in our system is equally hazardous. <strong><em>Indeed life hangs on a critical balance</em></strong>.</p>

		<p>From where do we get our drinking water? More than 10 billions of litres every day for all the people in the world! There is a beautiful cycle that goes on to provide salt free water for us. Solar heat produces water vapour from the oceans. Being lighter than air, vapour goes up and forms clouds and comes down in rains to form glaciers at the poles. Rains fill lakes, feed rivers and provide ground water which we draw, drink and stay alive.</p>
		<p>Life is not possible without water: that simple chemical bond of two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen atom. Strange when you come to think of it!</p>

		<p><em>A brief news item from the Times of India (24.4.13) </em></p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>“The mysterious traces of water in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter came from a comet that smashed into the largest planet of the solar system in 1994, the European Space Agency (ESA)has found. ESA’s Herschel’s space observatory solved the long- standing mystery as to the origin of water in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, finding conclusive evidence that it was delivered by the dramatic impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy9 in July1994.”</em></p>
