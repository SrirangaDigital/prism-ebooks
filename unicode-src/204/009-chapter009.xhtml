		<img src="images/032.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>The Greeks believed that wind is nothing but the earth breathing in and out.</p>
		<p>Wind was deified in the early civilizations. Vayu, Pavan, Marut were the names of wind gods in India, the Greeks had Boreas, the purple winged god of the North wind of the four directional Anemoi. Vayu is described as having exceptional beauty and moving noisily in his shiny coach driven by two or forty nine white and purple horses.</p>

		<p>The Chinese had Feng Bo.</p>
		<p>Mythologies are fascinating to read. Realities are somewhat dull in comparison. Still, let us get into it.</p>
		<p>Remember we learnt that we are immersed in an ocean of air?</p>
		<p>The air does not stand still, particularly since the earth is not heated uniformly by the solar rays that it receives. The equatorial and tropical regions receive heat more directly and are much hotter than the polar regions which are perennially covered by ice. As the air in the equatorial region becomes hot, it becomes lighter and moves upwards, almost up to the end of the troposphere leaving a low pressure belt below. At that high altitude the air gets cold and dense and moves towards the north and the south poles where low pressure belts are created as the cold and tense air from the poles move towards the low pressure region created at the tropics and the equator. The cooled air from troposphere comes to fill the airspace in the poles. The cycle is thus complete. <em>Wind is nothing but moving air.</em></p>

		<p>The movement of air is not as simple as we have just described. It does not simply flow from the equator to due north and due south and back. Rotation of the earth affects its movement to a considerable extent, due to what is known as <strong><em>Coriolis effect</em></strong>. At the equator, the earth rotates at 1675 km an hour moving from west to east, dragging the atmosphere with it. As we move away from the equator to <em>higher latitudes</em>, to the north or to the south, the ground speed decreases, becoming almost zero at the poles (In Delhi the speed of the earth is about 1400km an hour.) <em>The earth rotates counterclockwise when observed from the North Pole and clockwise when observed from the South Pole</em>. At the North Pole, the air, instead of flowing due south, is deflected to the right and at the South Pole is deflected to the left. <em>Unlike buses, winds are named not by their destination but by their origins</em>. So the north wind becomes north-east wind (because that is what appears to be the origin of the north wind deflected to the right from its path from the north) Likewise, the wind from the South Pole appears to originate from the south-east. (<em>see below for further illustration of Coriolis effect</em>)</p>
		<p>Add to it local factors like the presence of seas, lakes and mountains and forests all of which affect the movement of air. The picture gets more and more complicated due to seasonal variations caused by the 23.5 degree tilt of the earth and you know why the job of a meteorologist who makes weather forecasts, so hopelessly difficult since the moving air carries water vapour and causes rains and also affects the temperature.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">THE MONSOONS</h2>
			<p>Land masses get hotter or cooler faster than masses of water. During the hot months of summer in India, land mass of the Deccan area heats up considerably more quickly than the water in the Arabian Ocean. As the hot air from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra begins to rise, the cool air from the ocean begins to flow loaded with water vapour. It is the south - west monsoon which moves toward north and north- east during the months of June, July and early August. It causes <em>Monsoon rains</em> on which India’s agriculture depend heavily. During winter months, landmass of the country cools down while the water of the oceans still remains warm and makes a low pressure belt. North-east wind begins to blow towards South- west. A section of the wind collects water vapour from the Bay of Bengal and rains on the Deccan Plateau. This gives the <em>winter monsoon rains</em>.</p>

			<p>Monsoons give us food. The summer monsoon some time causes devastating floods, especially in Bengal and Assam.</p>
			<p>Winds take surprisingly different forms! From gentle breeze to catastrophic tornadoes! Hence perhaps the concept of forty nine horses of Vayu.</p>
			<p>There was a time when winds were the only means of navigation across the oceans. Trade winds were generally used for navigation for trading purposes. Then there are the cyclones and typhoons that cause devastation.</p>
			<p>What is the source of wind energy? It is the Sun again. The enormous heat engines that carry heat and water from one place to another with the help of winds is driven by the SUN.</p>

			<p>A French Mathematician and mechanical engineer . He was born in the year 1792 and died in 1843. He was a Professor of Mathematics and Physics and is famous for his contribution called <em>Coriolis effect</em>.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">CORIOLIS EFFECT:</h2>
			<p><em>Let us assume there is a target T on the equator, to be shelled from the North Pole. The shell is hurled due south along the longitude where T is located. Since both the shell and the target rotate with the earth, it is expected that the shell will hit the target. Will it? Let us see</em>.</p>
			<p>As the shell S takes off, it is subjected to three forces. One, the force along the longitude due to the firing of the cannon , the other is the gravitational pull and the shell takes a parabolic path due to these two forces and is expected to land on the target. There is, however, a third force due to the rotation of the earth imparted to the shell by the atmosphere which,( due to the earth’s gravity), moves with the ground and drags the shell with it . As we have stated earlier, the ground speed changes, being almost zero at the Pole and being 1675km/hr at the equator. As the shell takes off from the Pole, <em><strong>the effect of the third force on it is minimal, increasing slowly as the shell approaches the equator where the ground speed is maximum</strong>. The target, right from the start, had kept moving at the maximum speed, being located at the equator, and the shell which had a slow start sidewise would fall behind, unable to catch up and <strong>will miss the target</strong></em>.</p>
			<p>To an observer at O, the shell will appear not to have come from the north, heading due south, but will appear to have come from north-east because he sees that the shell lands behind i.e. west of the target T. Let us remind ourselves that, observed from the North Pole, the earth rotates counter-clockwise. Same thing will happen if the shell is targeted from the South Pole It will appear to come from south-east moving westward.</p>
