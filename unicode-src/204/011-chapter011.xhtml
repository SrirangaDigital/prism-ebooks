		<img src="images/041.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p><em>KENTS CAVERN </em>is a long cave formed underground in Torquay in the south of England about 400 million years ago. It was discovered over 180 years back. Bones and jaw bones found in the cave showed that homo sapiens and neanderthals lived there along with bears and other predators</p>
		<p>It was a very sunny day outside when we entered the cave. We were led deeper and deeper inside by the guide who used a powerful torchlight to show the path. All on a sudden the guide turned off the light. It became pitch dark like I had never seen before. There was a hushed silence! All we could hear was the sound of dripping water as it has been dripping for thousands of years. The darkness seemed impenetrable. Just as suddenly as he had turned off the light, the guide struck a match and held it over what looked like a plate. Almost instantly, the cave lighted up.</p>

		<p>“This is a sea shell” said our guide. Our ancestors filled shells like these with dry moss and animal fat and struck a fire using two pieces of marble. It took them many thousand years to learn this. Until then they lived in the pitch darkness that you experienced just now. Can you now imagine what transition it must have made to their lives when they learnt the use of fire for having sustained lighting? They had already learnt the use of fire for cooking. Making a fire for the purpose of cooking by using a special variety of dry wood or by striking pieces of marble was a great step forward in human civilization when ancient humans learnt to control fire rather than be scared by it like all other animals. To be able to cook meat in a lighted cave and be able to fend off predators with fire was followed by the next step of being able to make weapons out of sharp pieces of stone that they could collect in the lighted cave. Fixing them to a long piece of wood was the next step forward.</p>
		<p>“When and how did they learn cooking?” was a question from a young boy in the group.</p>
		<p>“That must have been an accidental discovery. If a fire started in a forest, many animals would get burnt and the homo sapiens who escaped found that roasted meat of burnt animals tasted better than raw meat. When it happened is somewhat difficult to say.”</p>
		<p>“Could a fire start on its own?” was the persistent question from the same boy.</p>
		<p>“Yes, it could and it still does. If two dry branches keep rubbing against each other, heat caused by friction may easily start a fire. Sometimes, sunrays passing through a drop of water that act like a lens may fall on dry leaves and start a fire.” said the guide</p>
		<p>Out of the caves, into the sunny holiday resort, we stopped for a meal at a restaurant and watched a barbeque being cooked. Things have remained so much the same in so many respects and I could not help thinking how hundreds of thousand years later, women in our country still collect firewood, the most primitive medium for cooking, and about 400 million people still do not have access to electricity and have to depend on lamps to light up dark nights. The only difference is that they use kerosene and not animal fat for their lamps.</p>
		<p>Fire is the oldest form of energy that humans have been using. Wind has been used much later. Fire has been burning inside the earth ever since its creation and still does. Volcanoes underneath the oceans and above the earth spew fire. But these fires are destructive and except from a very long term perspective it is of no use for us. Apart from cooking or being used for fighting, fire had little use until metals began to be used by smelting with fire. Smelting ushered in the Bronze Age (3300BCE-1200BCE) and Iron age (around 1100 BCE) and human civilization took yet another giant leap forward.</p>
		<p>One of the longest leaps was in boiling water and using the power of steam. This was started more than 2000 years ago but possibly not put into practical use.</p>
		<p>From Torquay we boarded a train pulled by a steam engine that was about 100 years old. There was a big boiler and coal was continually fed into the fire that heated water. Black smoke continuously came out of the chimney.</p>

		<p>Out of the train, we boarded a steamer that brought us to Dartmouth. There, inside a park, is preserved a model of the first Newcomen engine. Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) with his assistant John Calley, invented what came to be known as the first steam engine which some believe was the precursor to the Industrial Revolution. The Newcomen engine was intended for pumping out water from inside the coal mines. Coal was widely used at that time for heating, cooking and for industrial furnaces. It was however not a very efficient machine and was superseded by the engine made by James Watt (1736-1819). Steam locomotives were slowly developed and by nineteenth century became the main mode of transportation along with steamers.</p>
		<p>The most important use of fire in modern days is the production of steam for driving turbines that run generators to produce electricity. All these will be discussed in detail later as we talk about the production of electricity that has now become the main source of energy for lighting, heating or cooling, our rooms and also widely for cooking purposes.</p>
		<p>Thousands of years have passed since our ancestors used to sit in caves, lighting them by burning animal fat on dried moss while cooking on wood fire. Extravagant energy use by some of us is presenting problems that we shall address later.</p>
		<p>What we have done in our story telling so far is to describe briefly the five classical elements that according to our ancient scriptures considered constituted this world. They are:</p>
		<p>Kshiti (the earth), Byom (the sky), Ap (water), Marut (Wind) and Agni (Fire) and above all the Surya, the SUN the ultimate source of most of our energy.</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>Thomas Newcomen</strong> (shortly before 24 February 1664 – 5 August 1729) created the first practical steam engine for pumping water, the Newcomen steam engine. He was an ironmonger  by trade. He was born in Dartmouth, Devon, England, near a part of the country noted for its tin  mines. Flooding was a major problem, limiting the depth at which the mineral could be mined. Newcomen’s great achievement was his steam engine, probably developed about 1710, combining the ideas of Thomas Savery  and Denis Papin. The ‘fire engine’ was not very effective and could not work beyond a limited depth of around thirty feet. Newcomen replaced the receiving vessel (where the steam was condensed) with a cylinder containing a piston. Instead of the vacuum drawing in water, it drew down the piston. This was used to work a beam engine, in which a large wooden beam rocked upon a central fulcrum. On the other side of the beam was a chain attached to a pump  at the base of the mine. As the steam cylinder was refilled with steam, readying it for the next power stroke, water was drawn into the pump cylinder and expelled into a pipe to the surface by the weight of the machinery. Newcomen and his partner John Calley  built one of the first engines at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley  in the West Midlands. A working replica of this engine can be seen at the Black Country Living Museum  nearby.</p>
