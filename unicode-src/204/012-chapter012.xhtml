		<p>As we came out of the <em>400 million year old dark caves of the Kents Cavern</em>, into a bright sunshine, there was a pleasant breeze blowing outside. Tall eucalyptus trees in the forest nearby swayed in the wind.</p>
		<p>“Were there any trees and forests here 400 million years back?” I wondered. It is difficult to say but near about this time, may be a few million years later, plants had begun to grow on land. First there were green algae and later seeds and still later plants evolved.</p>

		<p>How life was formed from the various chemicals like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, about two billions of years ago is another story. Chlorophylls had most certainly formed earlier. Chlorophyll is a biomolecule. In Greek, <em>chloros</em> is green and <em>phyllon</em> is leaf. This pigment is a poor absorber of Green and the near green portions of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These are abundantly present in leaves. Since Chlorophyll is a poor absorber of Green, leaves usually look green since an object reflects the colour it cannot absorb.</p>

		<p>Chlorophyll is vital for <em>PHOTOSYNTHESIS</em>. It helps to convert carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) into Glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and Oxygen in the presence of light. This process has been going on in nature for millions of years, helping algae to grow into plants and for plants to grow bigger and bigger as a storehouse of energy absorbed from light energy from the Sun as may be described by the simple chemical equation:</p>

		<p>This apparently simple chemical reaction is of unusual importance. It provides food for plants to grow and converts carbon dioxide into oxygen which is the breath of life. The Green leaves of the plants and the green grass help to feed us and produce oxygen that keeps us alive.</p>
		<p>About 300 million years ago, trees that had grown, and died after some years fell and sunk in swamps. Being buried under water they were cut off from Oxygen and did not decay or get destroyed by insects. Under pressure, these formed what is called <em>PEAT</em>. With time, the water inside the buried trees or the Peat was continuously squeezed out and the Peat increasingly hardened and the percentage of Carbon kept increasing in the process. Layers were formed over layers and coals of different varieties were formed.</p>
		<p>The soft brown varieties are the <em>Lignite</em> which have 25-35% of Carbon and 35% of water, the next is <em>Sub-bituminous</em> coal with 35-45% of carbon, the next layer is <em>Bituminous Coal</em> with 45-85% Carbon and <em>Anthracite</em> is the hardest variety with 85-90% Carbon content and they were buried with all the energy in <em>Sunlight</em> the trees had absorbed millions of years earlier.</p>
		<p>Coal was not used as a fuel until relatively recently. But Charcoal has been used as early as 5000 B.C.</p>
		<p>“What is charcoal?” Charcoal is formed when wood is slowly burnt in the absence of oxygen. In early years charcoal used to be made by burning wood in shallow hearths covered by earth. Wood burnt slowly and the moisture was removed leaving almost pure carbon.</p>
		<p>Some spectacular cave drawings in charcoal as far back as 30,000 years have been discovered. It is unlikely that men knew how to make charcoal in those days or put it to any other use. Probably, charcoal was picked up by them from where trees had got burnt in some forest fire.</p>
		<p>As has been stated earlier there is evidence however, that charcoal was used as a fuel as early as 5000 B.C. The use of Charcoal significantly increased when metal extraction came to be known. Bronze age, referred to earlier, demanded high temperatures, much higher than about 800 deg.C that burning wood could provide. Charcoal could provide 300 deg.C more. The Iron age (1100 B.C. onwards) increased the need of an enormous amount of charcoal and special forests were cultivated for growing trees for making charcoal. The Greeks and later the Romans during the first centuries A.D., began producing huge amounts of iron, both for arms and sculptures and developed sophisticated methods of producing charcoal.</p>
		<p>Charcoal tars found much use in house building and also in ship building as useful joiner and in view of the absorptive capacity of charcoal it began to be used for purifying air and water and other chemicals.</p>
		<p>The major use of charcoal was still for fuel and for metal production until the nineteenth century when concerns were expressed about the use of thousands of acres of agricultural land for growing trees for charcoal production when the technology for Coke production from relatively low grade Bituminous coal was invented.</p>
		<p>In England, coal fields were discovered in various places. New Castle was one of them. The discovery of a huge source of energy stored underground spurred on industrial activities. New tools were invented for going deeper. Steam engines were invented and we have already mentioned the first <em>NEWCOMEN ENGINES </em>that began to be used for pumping out mine water. As time passed, coal began to be used as the main source of energy. The use of coal in rail engines changed transport system. Animal power was replaced by steam power obtained by burning coal and <em>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS USHERED IN</em>. With abundant coal underground and steam power from engines made by innovative engineers, Britain surged ahead of other countries. Railways were set up in various colonies including India. The first passenger train in India chugged out of Bori Bunder in Bombay to Thane in the year 1853.</p>
		<p>Today, Indian Railways transport over 7 billion passengers a year.</p>
