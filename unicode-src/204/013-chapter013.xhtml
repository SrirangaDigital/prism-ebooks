		<p>As we stepped into the boat moored at some point at the bank of the Chester Canal, I found a leaflet lying on a table inside the boat describing the origins of this canal. It read as follows: “Started in 1772, at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the Chester Canal was intended to link the city of Chester with growing centres of industry and trade and also the midlands.” The canals were dug for carrying goods and passengers from one part of the country to another. Barges were loaded with goods and horses were harnessed to pull them. On the Ganga and on other rivers in India big boats were used to transport goods. Sher Shah Suri had the Grand Trunk road re-built during the 16th century (which has been now modernized and stretches from Guahati to Amritsar). Horses and elephants were used for transporting goods.</p>
		<p>The Industrial revolution (1760-1850) is believed to have started in England after animal power began to be replaced by steam power.</p>
		<p>Coal mining had become a major activity at that time. Coal appeared to offer an endless source of energy. Conversion of coal into coke was a major achievement in that even low grade coal could be used in industries which began to flourish. Iron industry thrived and with it other metal industries.</p>

		<p>It so happened that many innovators with great enterprise appeared on the industrial scene. Automation increased production. Textile industries thrived. Steam began to be used increasingly but not effectively. Mining industries, especially for coal and iron demanded a huge labour force. Men, women and even children used to go down into the mines for digging the ores and even carrying them up on their backs. Underground water often flooded the mines and they had to be manually carried out. Most of the labourers lived near the mines and industries in appalling conditions and they had to put in nearly twelve hours of labour a day for small wages. The Newcomen engines, referred to in an earlier section was a blessing. It particularly helped in pumping out water from the mines.</p>
		<p>Newcomen engines were indispensable but were inefficient. It would be said that a Newcomen engine needed an iron mine to make and a coal mine to run it. It was James Watt who appeared on the scene and significantly improved the efficiency of steam engines.</p>
		<p>James Watt (1736-1819) was a Scottish instrument maker. He could not attend school in view of his poor health and was taught by his mother at home. It is said that James Watt used to watch the kettle in the kitchen while he had his lessons from his mother and got interested in the power of steam. While he was working as an instrument repairer in the University of Glasgow, he was deputed to repair a Newcomen engine. While working on it, James Watt instinctively realized that a Newcomen engine was grossly inefficient because it threw out and wasted much of the hot steam produced.</p>
		<p>James Watt designed a much improved version with an additional condenser to avoid wasting hot steam and with the help of partners he made an improved version of steam engine which was patented. It is believed that, “James Watt’s improvement to the steam engines converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
		<p>James Watt was not only a mechanical engineer but also a chemist and made significant contributions to Thermodynamics. His services were acknowledged by naming the unit of power as “watt” as in a 60 watt or 100 watt electric bulb or a 500 mega watt generator.</p>
		<p>The James Watt engine was not adapted to run as a locomotive. There were a number of innovative engineers trying to make steam locomotives. Perhaps the most useful and efficient of these turned out to be the ROCKET ENGINE made by George Stephenson (1781-1848)</p>
		<p>Stephenson could not go to school and was virtually illiterate until the age of 18. His father was a poor miner who made 15 shillings a week and support a large family. George Stephenson used to work for a pittance to eke out the family income. At the age of 14 he started working in the mine . He was highly innovative and since mines are filled with dangerous flammable gases, Stephenson made a safety lamp totally unaware that Sir Humphry Davy was involved in making what came to be known as the “Davy’s safety lamp.”</p>
		<p>George started attending evening classes to educate himself. A few years later, with the help and support of the owner of the mine, he developed a steam locomotive to lift coal from the mine. By the year 1830, with relentless efforts and great ingenuity, Stephenson made steam locomotives that could run at 29 m.p.h. George Stephenson died in 1848. By then Steam locomotives had spread in England, Europe and America. In India the first train started in 1853. By March, 2011, 1,20,000 kms of railway lines have been laid</p>
		<p>When we were young, steam engines were the only ones that were used. Diesel or Electric locomotives had not come into the market. Coal was continuously fed into a fire to make steam in boilers and the steam used as effectively as possible in those days to haul a train of carriages. Smoke and coal dust were continuously thrown up. By the time we reached our destination we would be covered with coal dust. In those days no one seemed to worry about atmospheric pollution.</p>
		<p>Coal engines, the great discovery of Newcomen, James Watt , George Stephenson that ushered in the Industrial revolution and changed the face of the world were slowly phased out all over the world and replaced by diesel and electric engines.</p>
		<p>The last major steam locomotive in India puffed out in 1984.</p>
