		<p>The word ‘mumiya’ in Arabic means bitumen and the word ‘mummy’ is said to have been derived from it. You can see the pictures of mummies, especially the Egyptian mummies on your computer. More than 6000 years back, some of the dead humans. mainly from royal households, were mummified all over the world and particularly in Egypt, wishing immortality for the departed. Bitumen that would ooze out of the earth in certain places in Egypt, Greece, Israel, Russia and several other places and turn into pitch was found to be a very good preservative and used for making mummies. It was also a good binder for securing wooden structures as a joiner. In many countries and India was no exception, Temples were constructed around eternal flames which were nothing other than a copious flow of oil or gas (mainly methane) from under the earth. Once ignited oil or methane, a flammable gas, would continue to burn and awe-struck worshippers deified these flames as something divine.</p>
		<p>We have seen how coal was formed over millions of years from trees buried in swamps and being fossils of trees, coal is classified as a “fossil fuel” and so are crude oil and gas formed from organic materials buried under the ocean-beds. Organic materials called zooplankton and algae that grew absorbing solar energy give up the solar energy in the form of heat and light millions of years later when we burn a candle or use a gas oven. Some believe that carcasses of sea animals also contribute towards the formation of oil. As sand and mud accumulate on the organic materials these are “cooked’ in heat and under pressure in the absence of oxygen to make what is called “Kerogen”. The kerogen molecules eventually break into shorter and lighter molecules made almost entirely of carbon and hydrogen.</p>
		<p>If there is more gaseous content, it forms natural gas and if it is mainly liquid, it forms what we call “crude oil’ a black and waxy material. The crude oil and gas when formed under pressure and heat ooze through porous rocks and rest in traps of what are called sedimentary rocks.</p>

		<p>It is interesting that the name <em>Petroleum</em> is derived from the words <em>Petra</em> (Greek for stone) and <em>Oleum </em> (Latin for Oil). So the source of oil was well-known. The Chinese were drilling oil from relatively short depths of about 800 ft. with bamboo poles as early as 300 century A.D. and burning this to extract salt from sea water and much earlier than this, the Egyptians used pitch as preservatives and binders, the Persians paved the roads with pitch in 8<sup>th</sup> century and it is believed the Chinese and Japanese began using gas for heating and lighting as early as the 9<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
		<p>You may have heard of Marco Polo the famous traveler and he wrote during his visit to the Azerbaijani city of Baku on the Caspian Ocean in 1264, that he saw shiploads of oil being produced there. It is interesting that in 1806 some engineers in the U.S. in West Virginia were drilling wells for brine or salt water to be used for some medicinal purposes and were annoyed when they found some black oily mass mixed with brine. They were annoyed and abandoned the wells. They did not realize that the oily mass would one day provide petroleum which is now called liquid gold. The first well for oil in the states was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859.</p>
		<p>Both crude oil and natural gas are mixtures of various compounds. Natural gas is a compound of methane, ethane, propane and butane. These may be described by the simple chemical formula C<sub>n</sub> H<sub>2n+2</sub>, n being 1,2,3 etc.methane being CH<sub>4</sub>, the simplest of them. Oil is made of various complex compounds and these may be separated by what is called fractional distillation. When the oil is heated petrol having the lowest boiling point evaporates first and is separated and condensed to provide what is called the aviation fuel, at slightly higher temperature the petrol used for motor cars separates out, then diesel then kerosene and the last in the list is bitumen that we have talked about in the beginning. In the middle of the nineteenth century, petrol was not in demand but kerosene became very popular since it was cheaper than <em>whale oil </em>used for lighting. Different distillates of oil are used for various medicinal purposes.</p>
		<p>In England and also in some of the cities in India gas was being used widely for street lighting. In some affluent homes gas would be piped in for cooking purposes. Aeroplanes were widely used in the second world war (1939-1943), marginally for postal purposes but not very widely for passenger services. Motor cars were very limited and only the very affluent people in India could afford motor cars. Horse-drawn carriages were common as you may have seen in some old movies. Tram cars had been introduced in cities like Calcutta and public buses had just about started. Cycle and hand-drawn rickshaws were common modes of travel for personal use and are still prevalent in many towns and cities in our country.</p>

		<p>From 1950 s there was a dramatic change in the use of oil all over the world and the use of coal for transport and heating became less as years passed. The use of oil for aviation has increased dramatically. Motor cars and two wheelers have made travelling dangerous as you see in any of our cities. These use plenty of oil apart from the atmospheric pollution they cause.</p>
		<p>Are we not running out of petrol? We are, unless some options are found or what some Russian scientists have been saying about the earth being a huge store of <em>abiogenic oil</em> that may be stored deep inside the earth.We shall touch upon this in the next section.</p>
