		<p class="text-center"><strong>“EARTH PROVIDES ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVERY MAN’S NEEDS,NOT EVERY MAN’S GREED’</strong></p>
		<p class="text-right"><em>Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
		<p>You will be amazed when I tell you that all over the world, we consume about 13 billion litres of oil every day. (Have you ever thought how long it will take you to count up to one billion? It will take you more than 12 years of non-stop counting to count one billion.) This huge amount of oil and more are being pumped out by us from inside the earth every day, partly to meet our needs, partly to indulge in our extravagance, our love of speed and comfort and sadly, to a significant extent, for defense purposes.</p>
		<p>We seldom stop to think that the oil reserve which took millions of years to accumulate is being squandered by us and will run out in less than 70 years in the middle east where a huge amount of oil is stored and in about 30 years in the rest of the world. Libya, Venezuela, USA, Russia are some of the relatively oil rich countries but considerably less rich than Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq. India’s oil reserve, as identified so far, is poor.</p>
		<p>Apart from the thoughtless exploitation of oil, finishing off in 125 years what Nature had taken over millions of years to make, we need to take serious note of the <em>Greenhouse Gases</em> that have been resulting from burning oil, gas and coal.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to figure out how we end up using 13 billion litres every day! That would mean each person on earth uses on an average 2 litres of oil every day! That can’t be true!</p>
		<p>It does not work out that way. First, various chemicals are extracted from crude oil. Main fuel guzzlers are cars and aeroplanes. Power generation also takes a fair amount of gas and petrol.</p>
		<p>Can you guess how much aviation fuel is used by a plane carrying say 400 passengers from Bombay to London (7200km) in a non-stop flight? It would be about 65,000 litres, each passenger using up 160 litres in 9 hours! But he covers 45km for one litre of petrol which makes flying much cheaper than travelling in a car even with three passengers! Isn’t that surprising?</p>
		<p>However, it is only a limited number of people in a developing country who can travel in a car or fly. A very large number have marginal access to oil and use may be a few litres of oil in a month to light up their dark nights.</p>
		<p>Of all countries, US is the largest consumer of oil (almost 3 billion litres a day) and was the largest polluter of the atmosphere until overtaken by China recently.</p>
		<p>In India we use approximately 480 million litres every day. It was almost 100 years ago that oil was found in Digboi in Assam. One of the largest producers of oil in India is the Bombay High field in the Arabian sea producing nearly 50% of India’s indigenous production of crude oil. A large amount of oil has to be imported by us and the price of oil in India is one of the highest in the world. The import of oil causes a great strain on India’s economy.</p>
		<p>Since oil is preferred to coal for transport, its demand has been increasing and possibly oil will run out sooner than we anticipate. Coal continues to be used widely for power generation and atmospheric pollution has been going on unabated. These issues have been engaging international attention for some years but no solution seems to be round the corner.</p>
		<p>In India explorations have been going on to find more indigenous oil and help our economy by reducing oil import. Apart from explorations in various coastal areas, explorations are on in Assam and in Northern Assam. In this context, it may be interesting to note that in Borholla, Assam, the possibilities of <em>abiogenic fuel</em> have been suspected.</p>
		<p>What is <em>abiogenic fuel</em>? We have described in our earlier article how oil and gas have been formed from degradation of ancient biological substances such as algae which grew in sunlight and is called <em>biogenic fuel</em> due to their biological origin.</p>
		<p>There were suggestions in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century that there may be oil available that do not have biological origin. The same suggestion from Russian scientists was made in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the latest in 1951 that hydrocarbons were there in the mantle at the time of formation of the earth which produced huge amounts of petroleum trapped deep down under impervious rocks like granite. The theory of petroleum of <em>abiogenic origin</em> has not been accepted by a large number of geophysicists but is mentioned here in view of the enormous possibilities it holds out if it comes to be true.</p>
		<p>Whether oil and gas are <em>biogenic or abiogenic</em> in origin, the largest part of the end product after use will be CO<sub>2</sub>, one of the main gases producing <em>Green house effect</em>.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</h2>
			<p>Have you been inside a Green House? In Bengaluru, in Lalbagh, there is a sort of a Green House where temperature higher than ambient temperature is maintained. Sun light comes through the glass and absorbed by the soil. The re- emitted infra red does not flow out easily and the temperature inside increases, helping certain types of plants to grow. (Green houses are fairly common in the US and Europe where moist atmosphere at temperatures higher than the ambient are maintained to help tropical plants to grow.)</p>

			<p>Burning of coal, oil and gas have been producing huge amounts of water vapour, CO<sub>2</sub> and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) which accumulate in the atmosphere that re-emits infra red, resulting in temperature rise. Although the mechanisms are somewhat different from what happens in a Green house, the analogy caught on. Studies over decades do indicate that the average temperature of our planet is slowly going up. This may cause the ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic to melt with devastating consequences threatening this planet.</p>

			<p>Other products of carbon have been causing a different kind of damage to our planet. We have mentioned in an earlier chapter how layers of ozone in our Stratosphere protects us from adverse effects of ultraviolet rays. Production of CFCs or Chloroflurocarbons for refrigerators made holes in our ozone layers, letting in undesirable amounts of ultraviolet rays creating health hazards.</p>

			<p>As we discussed earlier , several accidents helped our planet, the Mother earth, to nurture life. As her most intelligent inhabitants can we afford to destroy life in this privileged planet? We have to make determined efforts, cutting across national boundaries and rising above politics to protect our planet from man-made disaster.</p>
