		<p>It was amazing! Searching for the history of Internal Combustion or IC engines, to find among hundreds of names, the name of Tipu Sultan.(1750-1799),the Tiger of Mysore who fought the British army of the East India Company and gave his life, fighting to the end, in a treacherous war. What would Tipu have to do with IC engines? Not the IC engines for automobiles that we are going to discuss. His rockets which terrified the British were, in a way, an IC engine since the gun powder used in his rockets had a combustion chamber in which gunpowder would be burnt .The enormous thrust so produced would hurl a rocket to a great distance.</p>

		<p>The early automobiles were driven by steam and not by internal combustion.</p>
		<p>These were tried out in the continent and also in England where a legislation sealed their fate. In order to ensure the safety of pedestrians a man with a flag was required to walk in front of a car which travelled at about 3 miles per hour. Obviously, these cars were not very popular. It is interesting to note that while steam engines were mainly developed in Britain as described in an earlier chapter, IC engines and automobiles were developed mainly in Germany.</p>

		<p>IC engines began to be developed towards the end of the nineteenth century Initially, coal gas was used, to be replaced later by gasoline. What are IC engines? In essence, in an IC engine a mixture of gasoline and air is injected into a cylinder and compressed by a piston, when an electric spark ignites the gasoline it tries to expand and the high pressure generated pushes the piston down to do mechanical work. Chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy.</p>
		<p>A four stroke IC Engine was developed by the German inventor Nikolaus August Otto (1832-91) after twenty years of intensive research and the important particulars of this are the same as the petrol engine of today. This was called the “silent Otto” gas engine. A four stroke engine comprises 1) Downward intake stroke: where gas and air enter the piston chamber 2) Upward Compression where the piston compresses the mixture 3) Downward Power stroke when Electric spark ignites the fuel mixture and as the hot gas expands it delivers power 4) Upward Exhaust stroke: releases burnt gas from the piston chamber.</p>
		<p>There were two other Germans who came up with improved and better versions of Otto’s four stroke engines. They were Karl Friedrich Benz (1844-1929) and the Gatlieb Daimler (1834-1900), both around the same time.</p>
		<p>Nikolaus Otto had used coal gas . Benz and Daimler used gasoline. Benz invented the carburetor for fuel and air injection. His obsession with cycles possibly led him to produce three wheeled automobiles ( looking much like the rickshaws) with light IC engines mounted on the shaft. Karl Benz got a patent for his automobile in 1888. Benz is immortalized in Mercedes Benz, one of the most popular cars in Europe.</p>
		<p>Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900), a workaholic and a relentless perfectionist who drove himself and his co-workers mercilessly made the modern four wheeled motor car driven by Otto’s four stroke IC engine, powered by gasoline. He made his machines particularly light and small and fitted one to a bicycle producing the first motor bike in the world. Daimler, it is said, hated driving and never drove one of his cars.</p>
		<p>One person who cannot be left out of this episode is Bertha Benz, wife of Karl Benz who became quite familiar with the engineering details of her husband’s invention and one morning in 1888,without telling anything to her husband Bertha set off for her mother’s house 106 km away, with her two sons in their “motorwagen” which had never been taken for a long run. There were technical problems which she fixed herself. At a steep slope along the way, the brakes did not hold so well. She stopped and got hold of a shoe maker to nail leather straps on the brake blocks. That was the first time ever that brake shoes were made. When she reached her mother’s home she sent a telegram to her husband and later, on her advice, an additional gear was fixed in the car. Every two years, in a vintage car rally in Germany, the cars drive down the Bertha path to celebrate the first longest journey in an automobile.</p>

		<p>In 1892, another German engineer, Rudolf Diesel (1858-1913), patented what came to be known as Diesel engines. The main difference between diesel and gasoline engines is the way the ignition takes place. In a gasoline engine, fuel is mixed with air, compressed and ignited by sparks from spark plugs. In a diesel engine air is taken in and compressed to a high level so that it becomes very hot. Fuel injected at that point self ignites without sparks. This permits the use of inferior grade oil. Diesel engines consume less oil than an equivalent petrol car and have become very common all over the world.</p>

		<p>Automobile industry was still in its infancy around the turn of the century, but rapid developments were taking place when two industrialists, Charles Stewart Rolls and Frederick Henry Royce met in the Dining Car of the train to Manchester from London and there the agreement was struck for manufacturing what came to be known as the Rolls-Royce, the most prestigious cars ever to be made. It was on the 4th of May 1904, only 16 years after Benz got his patent for the car that looked like a rickshaw.</p>

		<p>The most remarkable development of automobile industry took place in America where Henry Ford ( 1863-1947) founded Ford Motor Company and for the first time introduced what came to be known as “Assembly Line” technology for mass production of motor cars. That was less than a hundred years ago.</p>
		<p>The number of cars and lorries now add up to almost one billion, using about 3.5 billion litres of petrol and diesel per day. Can we sustain this enormous consumption?</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>Henry Ford</strong> (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, the founder of the Ford Motor Company, and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production. Although Ford did not invent the automobile, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford to buy. He revolutionized transportation and American industry. As owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with “Fordism “: mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation.</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel</strong> (March 18, 1858 – September 29, 1913) was a German inventor and mechanical engineer, famous for the invention of the Diesel engine. Diesel was born in Paris, France  in 1858 the second of three children of Elise (née Strobel) and Theodor Diesel. His parents were Bavarian immigrants living in Paris. Diesel understood thermodynamics and the theoretical and practical constraints on fuel efficiency. He knew that as much as 90% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted in a steam engine. His work in engine design was driven by the goal of much higher efficiency ratios. Eventually he obtained a patent for his design for a compression-ignition engine. In his engine, fuel was injected at the end of compression and the fuel was ignited by the high temperature resulting from compression.</p>
