		<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI: the name evokes sheer awe even five hundred years after the man ceased to live. Da Vinci, the Old master who had, among several other great paintings, created <em>Mona Lisa, </em>the woman with an enigmatic smile, unsurpassed as a piece of art and specially preserved in Louvre, in Paris. Who could think that Da Vinci was a great scientist and a superb craftsman who was among the first to design an Aeroplane? He made 100 sketches, filled a note book with details about how to make it. It is not certain whether Da Vinci actually made an aircraft or he had just left the drawings. That is not very important. What is important is that Italy did not forget to name the International airport of Rome after Da Vinci.</p>

		<p>The flight of birds has always evoked man’s urge to fly. Almost every child spreads his hands and runs pretending to take off and fly. Many lives have been lost in man’s attempts to fly, with some kind of improvised wings and jumping from a height.</p>
		<p>There were many who believed that “some thing heavier than air cannot fly.” (not counting birds of course).Some religious leaders subscribed to this belief.</p>
		<p>In the Ramayanas, however, Ravana is said to have flown in his “Pushpaka Vimana” while abducting Sita. This was of course poetic imagery.</p>
		<p>Flying kites was very popular in China as far back as 400 A.D.</p>
		<p>Hot air balloons began to be used in Europe with two brothers Joseph (1740-1810) and Jacques Montgolfer (1745-1799) taking lead. The first passengers were a few sheep and goats that were flown a mile at a height of 600 ft. The first manned flight in a balloon took off with the brothers in November 1783.</p>

		<p>It was about the same time that gliders were being tried in attempts to fly.</p>
		<p>Sir George Cayley (1799-1850) is considered to be the father of aerodynamics. He made gliders.</p>
		<p>Count von Ferdinand Zeppelin (1838-1917) of Germany started making airships filled with Hydrogen gas which is much lighter than air. It is a story of relentless efforts and skill and after, several failures, the airships began to fly long distances eventually becoming the first airline connecting the US and Europe. Crossing the Atlantic from Germany to the east coast of the US in two days with 50 passengers dining in luxurious cabins, these airships that were over 300 meters long, 52 meters in diameter cruised gracefully at 125 km per hour across the blue oceans until one morning on May 1937 shortly before docking at Lakehurt, New Jersey, the Airship Hindenburg, burst into flames and in a matter of minutes reduced to ashes killing 35 passengers.</p>

		<p>There ended the history of airships, the dream of Count Zeppelin.</p>
		<p>The history of people trying to fly, heavier than air, is an endless list. It was realized that by using muscle power a man will not be able to fly as a bird does and power from an engine would be essential. But how does an aeroplane keep afloat against gravitational pull?</p>
		<p>Take a thin strip of paper about six inches long and hold it just under your lower lip. The strip bends down under its weight. Begin to blow straight and you will notice the strip of paper lifting up. It remains almost horizontal as long as you keep blowing. This follows <em>Bernoulli’s principle</em> named after Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) the most outstanding mathematician of the family of Dutch-Swiss mathematical geniuses who showed that where a fluid flows at a high velocity the pressure drops. When you blow straight above the paper, the pressure of air above the top surface drops and the pressure of air under the surface being higher, the paper strip is pushed up. The wings of an aeroplane has a special shape called aerofoil. When the plane speeds up, the velocity of air on the upper surface of the wings exceeds the velocity on the lower surface. The air pressure on the top surface, according to Bernoulli’s principle, becomes less than that on the lower surface. This produces an upward force called <em>lift</em>. Which increases approximately proportional to the square of the velocity of the aircraft. When the plane speeds along the runway to the required value, enough <em>lift</em> is produced to counter the downward gravitational pull and the plane takes off. This of course is an approximate account of how a plane flies.</p>

		<p>Did the Wright brothers, Wilbur (1867-1912) and Orville (1871-1948) know the details about <em>lift </em>and <em>drag</em> ? (another force that is created on the aerofoil as the plane speeds up). They did. They knew for certain that muscle power would not provide the necessary power to fly and the use of engines was essential. They made meticulous study of all the airplanes and gliders that were tried earlier. Their engineering skill as repairers of cycle helped them a great deal.</p>
		<p>The Wright brothers first made a number of gliders and studied their performance and then they made a plane fitted with an engine. On the 17<sup>th</sup> of December at 10.30 a.m. Orville flew for the first time and the flight lasted only 12 seconds, covering 120 ft. On the fourth attempt, it was Wilbur who covered 852 ft in 59 seconds and</p>

		<p>Wright brothers made history flying the free controlled, sustained flights in a power driven, heavier- than-air machine.</p>
		<p>Aviation has moved a long way from then. Today a Boeing 747 weighing more than 300,000 kg smoothly glides into the air with more than 500 passengers, only with two pilots, computers mostly in control. As you learnt in an earlier section, it will need 65,000 litres of fuel to make a journey of 7200 km. With thousands of aircrafts travelling all over the world all the time, how can we sustain this unavoidable extravagance? Hindenburg disaster had shown that hydrogen is no answer as a fuel unless it is made safe. Researches are on and hydrogen may become the fuel for tomorrow.</p>

		<p><strong>The Wright brothers, Orville</strong> (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and <strong>Wilbur</strong> (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who were credited with inventing and building the world’s first successful airplane  and making the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight, on December 17, 1903. In the two years afterward, the brothers developed their flying machine  into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. The brothers’ fundamental breakthrough was their invention of three-axis control, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.</p>
