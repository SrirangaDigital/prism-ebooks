		<p>Good Universities usually act as incubators where talents are hatched. There are many examples but in the present context let us focus on two,</p>
		<p>1) The University of Bologna (Italy)—It is the oldest <em>continually functioning</em> University in the World established around the year 1088. Among a large number of very distinguished alumni was LUIGI GALVANI. (1737-1798); 2)The University of Pavia (Italy) estd. 1361…among several distinguished alumni features ALESSANDRO VOLTA (1745-1827), Professor, Pavia Chair of natural sciences (1769-1804).</p>
		<p>Let us begin with Galvani. A shy, quiet but a brilliant man of great integrity, he wanted to join the church. But his father being a medical man may have prevailed on him to go for medicine. Galvani excelled as an anatomist and was offered a faculty position in the University of Bologna. He became the Director when he was barely 42 years old. His wife Lucia Galleazzi, joined Galvani as his assistant.</p>
		<p>As the story goes, Galvani had been working with frogs for many years. He was keen to observe the effects of static charges on frogs’ muscles. One day he accidentally touched a sciatic nerve of a frog fixed to a metal tray with steel knife and the frog violently kicked as if it were alive. Galvani was perplexed and excited to see this.</p>
		<p>There were discussions then going on in Europe as to how our body catches signals from the brain. For example how does the hand lifting a cup from a table receive the signal from the brain to do so? Galvani on noticing how frog’s muscle twitched announced that it was <em>animal electricity</em> present in the nerves that conveyed these signals to control muscular movements. Being a meticulous scientist, he carried out extensive tests and made careful notes. Finally he published a book but for some reason did not print more than twelve copies, one of which he forwarded to Alessandro Volta.</p>

		<p>Galvani and Volta were of opposite nature. Volta was flamboyant and adept in self-promotion which Galvani abhorred. Soon after receiving the book from Galvani, Volta opened a tirade of criticism of Galvani’s work. As it turned out, Volta was correct and Galvani was wrong in interpreting the experiments he had reported.</p>
		<p>Volta concluded that electricity is not inherent in the muscles. There is nothing like <em>animal electricity</em> as Galvani claimed but chemicals or muscles placed between <em>different metals cause electricity to be produced</em>.</p>

		<p>Very few have heard of Johann Sulzer, a professor of mathematics who, somewhere around the year 1750, sandwiched his tongue between two pieces of metal, one of zinc and the other of copper and noticed a pungent taste and had a tingling sensation. That was precisely Volta’s finding. Two different metals with a chemical (or a biochemical) make charges to flow from one metal (anode) to the other (cathode), through an acid or flesh. Sulzer did not pursue what he observed and missed the opportunity of earning immortality. This often happens in science.</p>
		<p>Galvani’s explanation was wrong but who would deny it today that electric signals from neurons do pass through the nerves and give us sensation and help us to control our muscles?. But these electric pulses are caused very differently.</p>
		<p>Alessandro Volta lost no time in widely publicizing his findings after he made what came to be known as “<em>Volta’s pile</em>”. Volta showed how he could, by chemical means, produce electricity. In his pile he kept small discs of zinc and copper stacked alternately, separated by cloth soaked in acid and sparks could be produced by connecting one end of the pile to the other end through a conductor and even current made to flow. That was the first battery (1800)</p>
		<p>It did not escape Volta’s attention that his pile produced what is now called <em>current electricity</em>, for, he wrote: “<em>This endless circulation of the electric fluid (this perpetual motion) may appear paradoxical and even inexplicable, but it is no less </em><em>true and real; and you may feel it, as I may say, with your hands.</em>”</p>
		<p>Needless to say, the flow of charges which constitutes <em>electric current was termed electric fluid</em>. (it is not <em>perpetual motion</em> as conceived by Volta. It decays due to resistance of a circuit unless there is a voltage or pressure provided by a battery to sustain it.)</p>
		<p>What then is the difference between static charges and electric current? We shall offer a simple analogy. Think of a water tank placed at a height. If the tank bursts all the water will fall to the ground at once. This is like static charges stored in the clouds and in a lightning - burst the charges flow to the ground. On the other hand, if we have a pool of water from which water is pumped out, made to flow in pipes and allowed to flow back to the pool it is like current electricity. The pump is analogous to the battery.</p>

		<p>We started this chapter with the stories of Galvani and Volta and their inventions. Let us end with their stories. You must have heard of Napoleon Bonaparte.(1769-1821) Like several other European countries Italy was invaded and occupied by Napoleon. Luigi Galvani refused to owe allegiance to Napoleon’s rule and was sacked from his University position. Galvani was without any job and any income. His wife passed away in the year 1790. Galvani was heart broken. He died in 1798 in abject poverty. Volta lost no time in owing allegiance to Napoleon and became his favourite and was showered with grants and was made a count.</p>
		<p>When we describe electrical pressure we use the unit of Volts named after Volta. Galvani had galvanized the world of science and Galvanometer is named after him.</p>
