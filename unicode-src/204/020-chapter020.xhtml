		<p>It seems amazing when we think that between the year 1800 and 2000, exactly within 200 years, the dramatic changes that have taken place in every sphere of human life when, previously, centuries passed and hardly any changes took place. The single discovery this dramatic changes may be attributed to was that of <em>Current Electricity</em>.</p>
		<p>It was, without a doubt, Volta’s pile that triggered off this scientific revolution. The first outcome was <em>Electrochemistry</em> and discovery of many elements. This was followed by <em>Electromagnetism</em> and <em>Electromagnetic Power generation and Drives</em>. Once electricity became widely available <em>Industrial Drives, Communication and Computers which are all driven by electric current</em> developed and changed the world beyond recognition.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Electrochemistry:</h2>
			<p>As soon as current electricity became available a new method of chemical analysis was ushered in. As a result, a number of elements that were known about but existed as chemical compounds were isolated, one by one, with unimaginable impact. Chemistry changed and our lives changed with it. Prior to the introduction of <em>Electrolysis</em> i.e. chemical decomposition by action of current, complex chemical methods were used to isolate various elements. Let us begin with hydrogen which is one of the most important of all elements.</p>
			<p>It was Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) who is credited as the discoverer of hydrogen, the first element on the periodic table. He observed that hydrogen was a highly flammable gas and on burning produced water. You may remember the disaster of Hindenburg when the hydrogen inside the Zeppelin burst into flames.</p>
			<p>Cavendish came from a highly aristocratic family of dukes and duchesses. Being a pathologically shy person he kept almost completely to himself. But he was designated to be the “richest of all the learned and the most learned of all the rich.”</p>

			<p>The famous Laboratory in Cambridge where Cavendish studied was named after him.</p>
			<p>Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) was a great experimental scientist who is said to have named hydrogen from the Greek words hydro (water) and gene (generator) which showed Lavoisier was aware that hydrogen could be derived from water. During the French Revolution he was guillotined and the great mathematician Lagrange said in bitter comment, “It took but a moment to cut off the head. It will take a century to grow another like it.”</p>
			<p>The English scientist Joseph Priestly(1733-1804), the discoverer of oxygen also deserves credit for producing water by burning hydrogen. Hydrogen was a landmark discovery before electrolysis started and Cavendish, Lavoisier and Priestly were the pioneering scientists during the late eighteenth century.</p>
			<p>Soon after Volta’s pile was announced by Volta, W. Nicholson and Prof. Anthony Carlisle carried out an experiment of passing electric current through water and found gas bubbles coming out of the two electrodes. One was hydrogen and the other oxygen.</p>
			<p><em>How does a Galvanic Cell or a Voltaic Cell Work?</em></p>
			<p>A combination of two metals (the electrodes) in an aqueous solution for producing electrical energy from chemical energy is sometimes called a Galvanic cell. One such cell may be called a Voltaic cell. A battery is an assembly of such cells.</p>
			<p>Let us have a glass jar and fill it with dilute sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) (the Electrolyte) and insert a zinc rod and a copper rod inside. Zinc dissolves in the acid and zinc sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) is formed. Hydrogen with positive charge is released from the reaction and (2H+) drifts towards the copper rod which gets positively charged. The zinc rod gets negatively charged. If the two electrodes are connected externally, electrons from the zinc rod flow to the copper rod through the external circuit. The electrolyte conducts current which completes the electric circuit. Hydrogen atoms keep drifting to the copper rod and (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>- -</sup>) to the zinc rod and the current continues to flow. (Not really. In this case a film of hydrogen soon forms around the copper rod and the flow of current slowly decreases.)</p>

			<p>The pioneer in Electrochemistry turned out to be a wood carver’s son, brilliant, precocious, dynamic and ambitious. It was Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829).</p>
			<p>He was born and brought up in Penzance in Cornwall, England. Davy’s education was not planned. To quote Davy, “I consider it fortunate. I was left much to myself as a child and put upon no particular plan of study. What I am I made myself.”</p>
			<p>Davy was a poet of no mean caliber. To quote the famous poet Coleridge, “If he had not been the first chemist he would have been the first poet of his age.”</p>
			<p>But Davy chose science and excelled in it.</p>
			<p>Davy joined the Pneumatic Institute in Bristol where “medical powers of various air and gases had to be tested. Davy tried a number of these on himself and was almost killed trying to inhale too much of nitrous oxide ( laughing gas) which was later found to be a suitable gas for anaesthesia. Davy received an offer of Asst. lectureship at the Royal Institution and joined it and eventually became its Director. Davy isolated several alkali elements. The first was potassium by sending electricity through caustic potash (KOH) and the same year (1807) he isolated sodium. He isolated several other elements like calcium, barium and boron. Davy appointed a young book binder as an assistant for washing test tubes and other appliances. He was Michael Faraday. Faraday accompanied Davy as his valet to the Continent and together they discovered iodine while in France. Faraday made major contributions to Electrochemistry but is remembered more for generating electricity, a fascinating story that we shall tell you very soon.</p>
			<p>Humphry Davy died in 1829 in Geneva where one can visit his grave.</p>
