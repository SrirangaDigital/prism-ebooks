		<p>When we discussed Magnetism and Electricity in earlier chapters, we treated them separately as though they are totally different entities and so was the thinking until almost 200 years before now. It was known that static charges attract or repel static charges, magnets also attract or repel magnets, but static charges do not attract magnets and magnets do not attract bodies that are electrically charged until one day on 21 April 1820, a Danish Professor called Hans Christian Oersted noticed the deflections of a compass needle close to a conductor through which electrical current from a Volta’s battery was switched on or off. Does the current flowing through a conductor behave as a magnet? Is there a link between electricity and magnetism?</p>

		<p>While travelling around Europe on a travel scholarship that he had won, he came to know a number of scholars who believed in symmetry in Nature and suspected that a close link between electricity and magnetism may exist and Oersted for the first time, came upon its evidence by sheer accident. Having a trained mind he did not overlook this evidence.</p>
		<p>Hans Christian Oersted was born in Denmark on 14 August 1777. His father was an apothecary and Oersted learnt a lot about drugs and their application, and he developed his interest in science from there. He and his brother Anders received most of their early education through self-study and when both brothers joined the University of Copenhagen, both of them excelled academically. Hans Christian earned his doctorate in 1799 in Metaphysics at the age of twenty two and during his travel round Europe, he developed interest in Physics. Oersted became a Professor at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
		<p>Oersted did not immediately publish his observation of the effect of voltaic current on magnet. He wanted to observe things more closely.</p>
		<p>After three months of extensive experiments he realized that magnetism is symmetrically distributed around the conductor rather than being radiated as heat or light are radiated.</p>
		<p>Oersted’s publication of his studies in the month of September 1820 was immediately picked up by Andre-Marie Ampere who carried out a mathematical analysis of electromagnetism and within seven days, submitted his comprehensive paper on it.</p>
		<p>You must be familiar with the unit of current. It is Ampere. We learnt earlier that the unit of voltage is volt, after Alessandro Volta.</p>
		<p>Voltage &#215; Current = Power.</p>
		<p>The unit of power is watt after James Watt.</p>
		<p>If you have a 100 watt lamp and apply 250 volts to it, the lamp will emit 100 watts of power while drawing 100/250 = 0.4 ampere of current.</p>
		<p>Current in ampere = Charge in coulombs/ time in seconds.</p>
		<p>Coulomb is the unit of electrical charge. Each electron carries a charge of minus 1.6 &#215; (10)<sup>-19</sup> coulomb. You can easily calculate how many trillion electrons will flow in 0.4 ampere of current in one second.</p>

		<p>Ampere was born near Lyon in France on 20 January 1775. He was a child prodigy. His father taught him Latin and helped his learning of mathematics, history, philosophy and natural sciences. Ampere had a phenomenal memory and the ability to grasp mathematics. By the time he was eighteen years old, he is said to have learnt all the mathematics that was known till then.</p>
		<p>When Ampere was barely fourteen years old the French Revolution (1789-1799) broke out. The fortress of Bastille where arms were stored fell on the 14<sup>th</sup> of July, 1789. French revolution was a revolt against the monarchy, aristocracy and Church.The king Louis the 16<sup>th</sup>, the queen and many members of the aristocracy were executed. Some of the liberals who led the revolution became autocrats and many innocent and talented individuals were sent to the guillotine. In the previous chapter you learnt about Lavoisier, who was guillotined.</p>

		<p>Ampere’s father felt that he would be safe with his family at Lyon while the revolution raged in other parts of France. Lyon was soon taken over and Ampere’s father was appointed the <em>Justice of Peace. </em>He was later arrested for what the revolutionaries considered was a wrong judgement by him and Ampere’s father was guillotined in 1793. This was such a shock for Ampere that he went into depression and stopped his studies.</p>
		<p>Ampere recovered from it after about a year and continued with his pursuit of mathematics. Ampere gained great proficiency in mathematics and physics and gave private tuition. He married a woman called Julie whom he loved dearly, but she was somewhat cold towards him. In 1801 Ampere left his infant son and ailing wife for Bourg where he had received an offer of Professorship. His wife died when he was away and Ampere never forgave himself for the death of his young wife.</p>
		<p>In 1804, Ampere got a professorship at the University of Lyon and moved back to Lyon and published a number of papers in mathematics. His seminal work on electromagnetism was published, as stated earlier, only seven days after Oersted’s paper appeared. In fact Ampere’s work was far more comprehensive than Oersted’s and placed the theory of electromagnetism and electrodynamics on a firm footing. Ampere demonstrated to the Academy of Lyon, how voltaic currents flowing through two parallel wires placed close to each other influence each other. If the voltaic currents flow in the same direction the wires attract each other and if the voltaic currents are in opposite direction, they repel each other.</p>
		<p>So the journey had begun and it was for Michael Faraday, an assistant of Humphry Davy, to step in and in a few long strides take electromagnetic Induction and electrodynamics to a stage when by rotating an electromagnet one could produce electricity.</p>
		<p>We still do so and typically rotate an enormous electromagnet 3000 times in a minute and produce 500 megawatts of electricity enough to light up 5 million 100 watt lamps.</p>
