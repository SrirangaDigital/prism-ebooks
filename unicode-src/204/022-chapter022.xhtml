		<p>It was a cold evening in London in the year of 1813. A carriage from the Royal Institution stopped in front of a book binder’s shop. Gas lights on the cobbled roads had been turned on. The candles in the bookbinder’s shop had been turned off except for the one in the attic where Michael sat with a book that he had just finished binding when he heard an impatient knock on the door downstairs. Michael ran down and opened the door and was handed over a letter with the emblem of the Royal Institution.</p>
		<p>The letter was from Professor Humphry Davy, asking Michael to meet him.</p>
		<p>Some time earlier, Michael had received free tickets to attend the lectures of Humphry Davy and had taken careful notes. At the end of the lectures, he copied and bound three hundred pages of the notes and presented the volume to Humphry Davy requesting him for a job. Davy had nothing to offer immediately but at the first opportunity appointed him as a Chemical assistant.</p>

		<p>Michael Farady (1791-1867) was born in Surrey to a very poor family. He sold newspapers when he was very young. His father could afford only three months of school education for him. Michael was very keen on learning and when he got an apprenticeship at George Ribeau’s shop for book binding and selling, he used every spare moment to read, particularly books on science.</p>

		<p>Although Michael had joined as a chemical assistant required to wash beakers and test tubes and keep the laboratory clean, he was soon found to be highly capable and motivated. Davy took him along in his continental tour as a valet since Davy’s actual valet was unable to come. Unfortunately, Davy’s wife Jane Apreece who was very conscious of her aristocratic status, ill treated Michael since he was a commoner. Michael however greatly impressed the scientists whom he met during the Continental trip.</p>

		<p>As has been discussed in an earlier chapter, Davy was one of the pioneers in <em>Electrochemistry</em>. Michael quickly picked up the trick of the trade and he made major contributions to this field. A number of laws in Electrochemistry carry his name. He discovered benzene and several compounds of chlorine and invented the first version of the Bunsen burner.</p>
		<p>Faraday was greatly interested in electricity and made his own Volta’s pile for carrying out experiments. It was around 1821 that Oersted’s and Ampere’s work were getting to be known widely. It is said that Professors W.H. Wollaston and Humphry Davy were one day discussing how to make an electric motor when Michael happened to be present. Michael instinctively realized that Wollaston and Davy, were going along the wrong track in their plans to achieve electromagnetic rotation. He designed and made a device where, for the first time, electromagnetic rotational motion was achieved. That was the precursor to today’s electric motor. When he published his work, Michael was accused of plagiarism by his mentor Humphry Davy and Michael, upset that he was so accused, stopped publishing his work on electromagnetism as long as Davy was alive (1830).</p>
		<p>It was Faraday who first observed that if there are two coils, one connected to a Volta’s pile and the other closed through a meter to record a current (ammeter) were placed close by facing each other, switching on current in the first one caused a momentary current to flow in the second coil. This phenomenon is called <em>INDUCTION</em>. Transformers which are very commonly used for stepping up or stepping down voltages and currents are based on the principle of <em>Induction</em> or more precisely <em>Mutual Induction</em>.</p>
		<p>Faraday also observed that a coil whose terminals are connected through an ammeter shows a momentary current if a magnet is moved in to or out of the coil. Faraday hypothesized that a magnet (or an electromagnet) produces a <em>MAGNETIC FIELD</em> and when a coil is moved through this field a voltage is <em>induced in the coil which causes a current to flow if the coil is closed</em>.</p>
		<p>From these observations it may be summarized that:</p>
		<p><em>A <strong>Magnet</strong> in <strong>Motion</strong> can produce <strong>Electricity.....Generator</strong></em></p>
		<p><em>A <strong>Magnet</strong> and <strong>Electricity</strong> produce <strong>Motion..........Motor.</strong></em></p>
		<p>Faraday’s classic paper published in the year 1835 paved the way to making Electric Motors and Electric Generators. Faraday did not express his findings in terms of equations but it was James Clerk Maxwell whom we have discussed earlier, put Faraday’s experimental findings in the form of an elegant equation which goes by the name of <em>FARADAY’S LAW.</em></p>
		<p>It was discussed in the last chapter that a typical generator of today may produce hundreds of millions of watts of power based on Faraday’s findings. Transformers help in transmitting electricity across hundreds of kilometers at times at 400,000 volts or even above.</p>
		<p>Michael Faraday, described as the best experimental scientist in the entire history of Science, received many awards. He turned down Knighthood because he did not want to dissociate himself from the humble background that he came from. He refused to work for the British Government to develop war weapons during the Crimean war (1853-1856) on ethical grounds. He believed in bringing science close to the public and introduced what came to be known as the <em>FARADAY LECTURES</em>.</p>
		<p>Faraday is said to have denied consent to be buried in the Westminster Abbey, reserved for the Royalty and men of great eminence (Newton was buried there) and a very humble memorial stone shared with his loving wife Sarah Faraday (1800-1879) who described herself as the “pillow for his mind”, adorns the Highgate Cemetery in London.</p>
