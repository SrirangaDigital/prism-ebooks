		<p>The cleaners of the hotel kept seeing the “Please do not disturb” notice and did not enter the room for a couple of days until the matron decided to walk in, only to find the body of the tall 86 year old occupant who lived alone.</p>
		<p>So had died the man who changed your life and mine. He could have been as rich as Bill Gates but died bankrupt. Today his elegant statue near the Niagara falls in New York draws hordes of travelers. He was Nikola Tesla (1856-1943).</p>
		<p>Tesla was born in Serbia, once a part of Yugoslavia. His father was a pastor. It was his father’s wish that Nikola should join the Church. Nikola wanted to become an engineer. Nikola fell seriously ill a number of times in his early life and once, when he was almost unconscious, his father is said to have shouted into Nikola’s ears,</p>
		<p>“Nikola, you get better. I shall make you an engineer.” Nikola recovered and became one of the greatest engineers the world has ever had. To Tesla we owe many essentials of life operated by electricity and electricity itself.</p>
		<p>Look up and you will see your ceiling fan quietly running for hours. Switch on the electric motor, or the refrigerator or almost any appliance. They are mostly made with <em>INDUCTION MOTORS</em>. It was one of many inventions of Nikola Tesla.</p>
		<p>Faraday was the first one to show how the motion of a magnet produced electricity and electricity combined with magnet produced rotary motion. Other engineers used his principle and commercialized the production of electricity. Edison was one of them and he showed how to produce light with electricity. Tesla showed how you can send electricity to long distances and run motors efficiently.</p>
		<p>When Tesla was in college studying engineering, crude versions of motors operated by Direct Current (DC) were in the market. Tesla did not like these machines which kept sparking and were inefficient. He kept thinking whether Alternating currents (AC) could be used for making better motors. As the story goes, Tesla was once convalescing from a serious illness and his friend took him to a park to watch the sunset. As he saw the sun go down, Tesla was overtaken by emotion and began to recite from Goethe’s <em>Faust</em></p>
		<p class="verse">“ <em>The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;</em><br /> <em> It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;</em><br /> <em>Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,</em><br /> <em> Upon its track to follow, follow soaring” </em></p>
		<p>And suddenly it came to him in a flash, the idea of a rotating magnetic field and an induction motor.</p>
		<p>After graduation Tesla took a job in a company of Edison in Paris. After some years he wanted to leave for the US, then the “New World” He was carrying a letter of introduction to Edison from a close associate of the latter. When Tesla met Edison he handed over the letter which read: “I have met two great men in my life. One is you and the other is the bearer of the letter.” Edison appointed Tesla for $18 a week and is said to have told Tesla, to design and make some special motors. “There is $50,000 for you if you can make it.”</p>

		<p>Tesla worked night and day, handed over the machines to Edison and claimed the promised sum. Edison laughed it off as an American joke he had made and refused to pay. Tesla was shocked and left Edison. For quite some time Tesla worked as a trench digger until one day his boss spotted his talents and together they started a company.</p>
		<p>Ideas came to him in flashes as Tesla described in his autobiography. And most of these ideas bore fruit. It is not widely known that Tesla was one of the first persons to send wireless signals. Marconi got the 1909Nobel prize for radio. Both Jagadishchandra Bose and Nikola Tesla had preceded Marconi. Bose did not patent his invention, Tesla did. Marconi infringed Tesla’s patents and used Bose’s coherer for the “Receiver”. There were endless litigations between Tesla and Marconi. Marconi lost at first but somehow he got the judgment turned into his favour; but in 1943, the Supreme Court of the US announced, rather too late, that the credit should have gone to Tesla and not Marconi. Marconi had outstanding skills for publicity, Bose did not want any publicity and Tesla was busy in his inventions and did not have the support of the upper echelons of the society which Marconi had and used to the maximum extent.</p>

		<p>Tesla never married and spent his entire life in hotels. He used to feed pigeons and he loved a particular white pigeon. Tesla was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda and the philosophy of <em>Vedanta</em>.</p>
		<p>Tesla’s major contribution to humanity was Alternating currents in preference to Direct currents as we shall discuss in the next chapter since it is essential to understand their difference in the context of Alternative sources of Energy.</p>
		<p>Tesla gave up his royalties for AC machines that Westinghouse had bought from Tesla so that AC could win and help science and society. Sadly, he had to declare bankruptcy in 1916.</p>
		<p>When Tesla was in failing health, he remembered one day that he owed some money to two secretaries who used to type for him, Tesla asked them to search his drawer and take the money out of there. Only a few dollars were found and Tesla asked them to take instead a heavy gold medal that he had received. The girls refused to take it and left.</p>
		<p>One evening, when it was snowing outside, his white pigeon came, fluttered her wings as if to tell Tesla she was dying. Tesla was soon to follow.</p>
