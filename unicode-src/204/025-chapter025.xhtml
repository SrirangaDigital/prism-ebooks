		<p>As we stood on the deck of a launch, covered in blue plastic overalls and approached the falls, its thunderous noise grew louder and despite water spraying all over us we could see the Niagara Falls, in its fullest splendour. A mist hung on it but we could see the enormous amount of water rolling down to great depths. What a huge amount of potential energy must be there getting converted into kinetic energy and then into electrical energy!” I thought.</p>
		<p>The same thought must have motivated a number of engineers and industrialists almost 120 years ago when hydroelectric generators had become a reality. The sordid tale of the “ War of currents” crowded into my mind. DC or AC? General Electric or Westinghouse? Edison or Tesla?</p>
		<p>When Alessandro Volta created history in 1800, after his invention of Volta’s pile it was Direct Current or DC (unidirectional current) that was first made to flow. From chemically produced electric current, to electromagnetically produced electricity was yet another epoch making invention by Faraday in 1831.</p>
		<p>Edison lighted up the Menlo Park, having developed parallel circuits, drawing two cables out from a generator, and connecting two ends of a bulb to different points along the two wires and that was how houses within a couple of kilometers from the generator were easily electrified by drawing two cables. Electrification, mainly of affluent homes, was being carried out from DC generators driven by oil.</p>
		<p>Water falls presented a great source of power to turn turbines to rotate the rotors of generators for producing electricity.</p>
		<p>The first hydroelectric station is believed to have been set up in Austria in 1860.</p>
		<p>The first Hydel generator in India was installed in Darjeeling in 1897 and the second was in Shimshapura near Mysore in 1902 (it is still in operation).</p>
		<p>The Niagara falls presented a huge source for hydroelectric power and different companies were bidding for the rights. The main contenders were General Electric of Thomas Edison and Westinghouse Company of Westinghouse. Edison wanted to produce DC mainly to protect the revenue he earned from his DC patents. Besides, he knew very little about AC systems. About Tesla’s AC system. Edison said, “Tesla’s ideas are splendid but are utterly impractical.”</p>

		<p>The electricity harnessed from the Niagara was too large to be used locally or within a few kilometers. But even 1000 kilowatts of power produced at 500 volts, needed the transportation of 2000 amperes of Direct currents( for DC, I = P/V) to supply industries at Buffalo, at a distance of say 30km.This called for very thick copper conductors which are very heavy and extremely costly. <strong><em>Voltage and current cannot be stepped up or down with DC but can be easily done in an AC system using TRANSFORMERS</em></strong>. 500 volts of AC voltage stepped up, say twenty times, using a transformer to 10,000 volts, reduces the current to a little more than 100 amperes and easily transported.</p>
		<p>What is the difference between DC and AC? Look at a simple cell used in a torch light. There is a protruding end and the other is flat. The protruding end is always Positive and the flat side is always negative, and electrons will always flow from the Cathode(-) to the Anode(+) and the current remains almost constant. Now look at the two holes in the socket in your room.(usually there are three holes, the larger at the top is for earthing.) The two lower holes keep changing their polarity. The current will <strong><em>not</em></strong> flow in the same direction as in DC but keep alternating 50 times in a second. In India and Europe the frequency is 50c/s or 50 Hz. In USA and Canada, 60Hz is used.</p>
		<p>Westinghouse realized that AC would be the only answer and Tesla had the right design for the <strong><em>Generation, Transmission and Utilization in an AC system</em></strong>. Tesla’s Induction Motor was the perfect machine for Industrial Drives. It may be relevant to mention in this context that an AC system may be divided into two phases or three phases. In a three phase system a generator has three sets of coils into which three voltages separated by 120 degrees are produced. Three phases fed to a motor produce a rotating magnetic field which makes the rotor rotate. That is the basic principle of an Induction motor. For small domestic motors single phase is split into two to produce the rotating magnetic field. In its simplest form generated voltage from an AC generator is stepped up using a transformer. If the voltage is ‘stepped up’, the current is ‘stepped down’. Low current is transmitted across a long distance, the voltage is then stepped down in stages and finally a single phase is fed for domestic use and three phase for Industrial or agricultural use.</p>

		<p>Edison realized that his DC system had no case. He started a massive anti AC campaign.</p>
		<p>He wanted to show that an AC system was lethal. He coined the word “Westinghoused” to mean “Electrocuted”. People started losing their pets which were later found electrocuted. The meanest effort was to make secret payments and have AC used for an Electric chair prevalent in those days for Capital punishment. The first man to be executed in New York, did not die immediately since the executor was unused to AC. The condemned man suffered so much that newspaper reporters were aghast to see this brutality.</p>

		<p>Despite all these campaigns, fortunately for humanity, AC won. Had DC won the day, electrification would have been much more slow, inefficient and limited.</p>
		<p>Tesla gave up his royalty to enable Westinghouse to introduce AC system and as we know died alone in abject poverty.</p>
		<p>When J.C. Bose was asked as to who invented the radio, Bose said, “An invention is more important than the inventor.” and as we know Marconi got the Nobel prize along with C.F. Braun. Bose and Tesla were not even mentioned.</p>
		<p>True, but it does not seem fair that Edison’s last breath was collected in a test tube and preserved in a museum while no one knew when Tesla breathed his last.</p>
