		<p class="text-center"><strong><em>An Alternative source of Energy!</em></strong></p>

		<p>Have you taken a careful look at the veins of a leaf? The sap which is sucked by the roots and transported to the leaves distributes itself all over the leaf through a network of veins for photosynthesis to take place with solar energy. Nature seldom wastes. If you look at how electricity is distributed in our country you will not find any pattern. It is haphazard. As a result nearly 20% of electricity is wasted in its distribution.</p>
		<p>But before we come to distribution we have to go through other stages.</p>
		<p>Let us take a coal based thermal plant. Coal is washed, crushed and fed into a boiler where steam is produced by boiling water. The pressure and temperature of steam are increased and forced into turbines at different stages and rotate a shaft on which the rotor (the electro-magnet) of the generator is mounted and rotated at 3000 r.p.m (3600 r.p.m.in countries that use power at 60 Hz). These days producing 500MW of power at about 15 kV is common. ( At Raichur the generators produce 220MW each).The voltage is stepped up to say 400kV with the help of a transformer and transmitted to long distances. After it reaches its destination the voltage of the electricity is stepped down in a couple of stages to 11kV and finally to 440 volts before distributing electricity to a number of houses or shops or for running Irrigation pumpsets. We do not get all of 440 volts to our homes available between any two lines or phases but 250 volts between one of the lines (or a phase) and the fourth line called the neutral.</p>

		<p>Losses take place at every stage and in our country the losses are often larger than usually happen in most countries. If we feed 100 units of energy through the coal, only 35 units come as electricity into the transmission line. About 3 units are lost in transformation and high voltage transmission and we are left with 32 units.</p>
		<p>Almost 10 units are lost in distribution (about 30%) and out of the 22 units that reach home nearly 90% is lost as heat in an incandescent bulb and we get barely 10% as light. This means from coal to an incandescent bulb from 100 units of energy we get only 2 units.</p>
		<p>This is not very exciting.</p>
		<p>What can we do about this? Generating companies do their best to make power generation more efficient. Much depends on the quality of coal. As has been mentioned earlier, the quality of coal in our country is poor and causes a lot of pollution. Considerable amount of water is required to run a thermal plant. Most modern plants re-circulate water to the extent possible. High voltage transformers and transmission are also reasonably efficient. When it comes to distribution at 11000 volts and 430 volts the system as we have mentioned above is grossly inefficient and produces huge losses. It is incumbent on the Electricity companies to modify the distribution network, taking cue, if need be, from how a leaf distributes its sap and cut down the losses. In most countries Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) losses are about 10%, whereas in India, varying from one state to another, losses come to more than 30%. If we can even reach 15%, which is not a tall order, we shall have 27 units coming home instead of 22 and we can do with 160,000 MW instead of 200,000 MW in the next 10 years as we had stated earlier.</p>
		<p><em>So, saving losses mainly in distribution would amount to not having to generate 40,000 MW of power which is more than one seventh of our installed capacity of 250,000MW and nearly eight times the power we generate from Nuclear power plants.</em></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Our role in energy saving:</h2>
			<p>What should be our role? There is a lot that we can do. Let us get back to the incandescent lamp that Swan and Edison had made 130 years back and we have still been largely using those bulbs. An incandescent lamp, as these are called, are very inefficient. Have you touched a bulb after it is switched off ? Do not try it. They are very hot. Almost 90% of the electrical energy that an incandescent lamp absorbs turns into heat. Only 10% portion turns into light.</p>
			<p>So we have to try to replace the inefficient incandescent lamps by Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) for the time being. We hope to have LED s or Light emitting diodes in future. We shall discuss these later. We shall be saving a considerable amount of energy and cost by replacing incandescent lamps.</p>
			<p>What about fans? Ceiling fans consume about 100 watts of power. If we keep a fan turned on continuously for 10 hours, we consume 1 kWh of energy. For 30 days it would come to 30 units</p>
			<p>And if there are two fans running in your house all night during summer months, 60 units are already spent. It is better to avoid using air coolers.</p>
			<p>We must make it a point to switch off fans when we do not need them. If you have the big resistor type of regulator to control the speed of a fan, you will notice that the regulators become very hot. That shows energy is being wasted as heat. Small and cheaper electronic regulators do not consume much electricity and are better if made by a good company.</p>
			<p>What about a refrigerator which most urban houses use these days? Their wattage (or power) is about 300 W, depending on the size. Make sure the door is closed after you have opened the fridge. Never place any hot food inside. The motor and the compressor would run for a short while to bring down the temperature to the set value and will not consume much electricity if the door is kept closed.</p>
			<p>There are other ways to save energy and we shall discuss these since energy saved means less energy generated and is the best Alternative energy source.</p>
