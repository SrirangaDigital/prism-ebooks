		<p>We often leave home with the TV turned on. A very careless thing to do. Our TV consumes about 200 Watts of power and in 5 hours uses 1.0 kWh or one unit of energy for nothing. Every unit counts.</p>
		<p>A geyser consumes 1500 to 3000 Watts, depending on whether it is a storage type geyser or an instant geyser. Whatever it may be, it is a power consuming device since using electricity for heating is one of the most inefficient modes of using electricity. We should keep the geyser turned on just as long as it is necessary since a number of families in cities or in towns turn on the geyser around the same time in the morning. The sum total of this simultaneous demands is a large value and the power suppliers find it hard to meet the demands of all consumers. Sooner we turn off the geyser the better for all of us. The best thing would be to install and use a solar heater and use geysers only on cloudy days.</p>
		<p>Lighting constitutes a relatively large part of the energy that we consume if we use incandescent lamps. If five such lamps, 100 Watts each, are kept on at the same time for 4 hours, we end up consuming 500x4= 2000 kWh or 2 units a day and 60 units a month.</p>
		<p>It is far better to use Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL), each of say 23 Watts. Our electricity consumption will come down by almost 45 units a month! CFLs are no doubt more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps but they last much longer and cost significantly less to run. When Light emitting diodes (LED), now available in torch lights, become commercially viable for domestic use, electricity consumption will be still less.</p>
		<p>We told you the story of Edisonâ€™s producing incandescent lamps and lighting up Menlo Park one evening. It was considered a miracle in those days in 1890s. Strangely, incandescent lamps have been in use for over 125 years with marginal changes. The carbon filaments originally used by Edison were replaced by Tungsten filaments making filament lamps last relatively longer.</p>
		<p>When a current flows through the filament, trillions of electrons flow every second through the maze of atoms of the filament. In the filament of a 100 Watt, 250 volt lamp, 1.57 trillion electrons flow every second. The friction produces heat and also light. Nearly ninety percent of the electrical energy is lost as heat.</p>
		<p>Fluorescent lamps give us cold light. In a Fluorescent lamp, mercury vapour and some inert gas ( e.g. Argon) are introduced and the inner side of the tube has a coating of fluorescent paint. A stream of electrons is made to flow from one end to the other. The electrons hit the mercury vapour and dislodge electrons from mercury atoms which hit the fluorescent paint and produces light which is cold. The history of its discovery is rather long. Fluorescence by electrical discharge was studied by many scientists going back to Michael Faraday. Even Edison had tried to produce fluorescent lamps but gave up after many attempts. Fluorescent light commonly called <em>neon light </em>were initially used for advertisements. They still are used for the same purpose.</p>

		<p>Fluorescent lamps or <em>Tube lights</em>, as they are commonly called, came into Indian market in 1950s. They save a lot of electricity but are costlier than filament lamps which still cost around Rs 15/-. The ballasts that are used in Tube lights are used to convert 50 Hz power supply into DC and then into high frequency AC to start the electron flow. These were also costly but have now been replaced by cheaper electronic ballasts.</p>
		<p>Tube lights are being progressively replaced by narrow helical tubes which are small and are easily fitted into sockets made and used for filament lamps. These, as you may guess, are <em>Compact Fluorescent Lamps or CFLs</em>. These are small, efficient and are rapidly replacing Incandescent lamps, despite the fact that they are much costlier. Average life of a CFL is about 15000 hours as against 1000 hours for a filament lamp.</p>
		<p>The problem with CFL is its disposal after its life. Since the inside of the tube has mercury vapour, it is harmful to dump it and break it,</p>
		<p>CFLs are likely to be replaced by Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs in not too distant future. LEDs consume very little power and will reduce electrical energy consumption to a considerable extent.</p>
		<p>Before we close this section on domestic energy conservation, let me quickly go and check if I closed the door of the refrigerator properly.</p>
