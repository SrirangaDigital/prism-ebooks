		<p><em>It was 8.15 in the morning on the 6<sup>th</sup> of August 1945. A B29 American plane flew over Japan and dropped a bomb on a Hospital in Hiroshima. Instantly, there was a huge flash and a ball of fire rose like a mushroom, covering the sky. 70,000 people died. Of those who did not die instantly, some died later, having lost parts of their skin, some died months later, having suffered acute agony. Another bomb was dropped three days later on another city called Nagasaki. Another 50,000 people died. Japan surrendered and the second world war came to an end.</em></p>
		<p>The bombs were nuclear bombs made in America and killed nearly 1.5 lakhs of innocent people.</p>
		<p>Other types of bombs, gun powder or explosives are results of chemical reaction. Nuclear explosions are totally different in nature. Before we go into this let us glance through the story of atoms and the basics of nuclear energy.</p>
		<p>It was Kanad in India and Democritus in Greece around 500 B.C. who conceived of atoms as the ultimate indivisible matter. <em>Kana</em> is a particle in Sanskrit and <em>Atomos</em> is indivisible in Greek.</p>
		<p>It was not until the early nineteenth century (1766-1844) that John Dalton, son of a weaver in England, proposed an atomic theory.</p>
		<p>J.J. Thompson in Cambridge, England, showed in 1897 that an atom is divisible and discovered a particle 1/1834 lighter than a hydrogen atom and this particle possessed an electric charge. This charge was assumed to be negative and called <em>Electron</em>. Eventually the existence of <em>Proton</em> which has nearly the same mass as a hydrogen atom and has a positive charge and <em>Neutron</em> having the same mass as proton but no electric charge, were discovered one after the other. We owe our present knowledge about the structure of an atom to Ernest Rutherford (1911), Niels Bohr (1913), James Chadwick (1932) and many other great minds of the early twentieth century.</p>

		<p>Rutherford visualized an atom as a solar system, with electrons, like planets, orbiting a heavy positively charged nucleus. Niels Bohr modified the rather simplistic but the revolutionary model by Rutherford. He also showed that electrons are on shells. If an atom receives energy, the electron jumps from an inner to an outer shell and from an outer to an inner shell if energy is emitted in packets (later called photons).</p>
		<p>Hydrogen, is the simplest of all elements. It has no neutron and has only one electron on the first shell which is capable of accommodating two. An atom is electrically neutral. If there are two electrons in the outer shell like in helium, there are two protons, in the nucleus balancing the charges. There are also two neutrons in the nucleus. Neutrons and protons are bound together by a strong nuclear force.</p>
		<p>To give you an idea of the size of an atom 100,000,000 of hydrogen atoms placed side by side stretch up to <em>one centimeter</em>.</p>
		<p>An atom is mostly empty space. The nucleus is heavy but 100,000<sup>th</sup> of an atom in size. If an atom is as large as a cricket stadium, the nucleus is like the cricket ball and electrons are as large as mustard grains. Atoms combine together and make molecules. A simple example of molecular formation is given below.</p>
		<p>An oxygen atom has two electrons in the first shell and six in the second shell which can accommodate eight electrons. The outer shell of an oxygen atom, therefore, has two vacancies. Two hydrogen atoms with one electron each in their shells combine with one oxygen atom in such a way that they are accommodated in the vacancies of the oxygen atom to give a very stable and wonderful molecule H<sub>2</sub>O which is water.</p>
		<p>There are a number of elements that are identical in every respect but have different number of neutrons in the nucleus. These are called <em>Isotopes</em>. Ordinary hydrogen that pervades the universe has a single proton but no neutrons, as has been stated earlier. It has two other isotopes, one of them is Deuterium and the other is Tritium. Deuterium has one neutron and one proton and tritium has two neutrons. We shall refer to these later.</p>
		<p>Uranium is a heavy element and has different Isotopes. Uranium 235, is an Isotope of uranium with 143 neutrons in its nucleus,(but 92 protons, i.e. 51 extra neutrons) If the nucleus of U-235 is bombarded by a neutron, it splits or fissions into two almost equal halves and three neutrons are produced which fly out and if they can hit other nuclei, more neutrons are produced and more and in no time, an <em>uncontrolled chain reaction may set in. This is called FISSION REACTION</em>.</p>
		<p>There is a small reduction of mass when a U235 nucleus fissions and as was shown by Albert Einstein by a simple equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, a very large amount of energy may be produced from a minute reduction of mass since c, the velocity of light is 300,000 km/second and c<sup>2</sup> is 90,000,000,000. A nuclear reaction may produce millions of times of energy compared to that of a chemical reaction that takes place at the atomic or molecular level. In a nuclear reaction some of the <em>binding energy</em> that holds the nucleus together may be released.</p>
		<p>The enormous energy that is released does the instant destruction. Lethal radiations keep emanating afterwards, leaving its cancerous stamp on humans and animals.</p>
		<p>The so-called simple and oft quoted equation relating mass and energy apart from accounting for the huge amount of energy release from a nuclear fission holds other intriguing concepts relating <em>mass and energy</em> and particle physicists often consider these as two names of the same entity.</p>
		<p>A brief reference to Madame Curie may not be irrelevant in this context. Fission involves heavy elements some of which emit lethal radiations.</p>
		<p>Madame Curie, a Polish scientist who spent many years of her life working on <em>Radioactive elements </em>and discovered <em>Radium and Polonium </em>got the Nobel prize twice. But having worked all the time experimenting with lethal radiations fell a victim to cancer. So did several other experimental scientists as we shall describe later.</p>
		<p>Albert Einstein a young man, with long disheveled hair and a shabby jacket, ran no such risks since he worked only with paper and pencil, drawing of course upon great experimental results reported by others and upon his exceptional mind.</p>
		<p>Albert was unceremoniously thrown out of his school at the age of fifteen because his Greek teacher thought that this boy would come to nothing and he was an undesirable example for other students in his class.</p>
		<p>So, Albert Einstein, thrown out of his school, wandered around for a year and with difficulty managed to get into a University and got a degree. He procured a job of a grade III clerk in a Patent office.</p>
		<p>It was there that he worked in his spare time on some basic problems in Physics and in the year 1905 he published five papers which ushered in a new era in physics.</p>
		<p>Albert Einstein, it is believed, grieved in his later years blaming himself to some extent for the Nuclear Bomb that killed so many innocent people. As we shall see in the next section, it was he who had advised the U.S. President that research should be undertaken for making nuclear bombs to preempt the Germans. But was he to blame or the war mongers who decided to drop the bombs on Japan?</p>

		<p class="myquote"><strong>Albert Einstein.</strong> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup> (which has been dubbed “the world’s most famous equation”), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>
