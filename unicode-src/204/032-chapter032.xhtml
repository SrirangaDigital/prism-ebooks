		<p><em>Compton : The Italian navigator has landed in the New World</em></p>
		<p><em>Conant :  How were the natives?</em></p>
		<p><em>Compton : Very friendly</em></p>
		<p>The Italian Navigator was Enrico Fermi, an outstanding Italian Physicist, Arthur Compton, his assistant and James Conant was of the National Defense Research Commission, U.S., date 20<sup>th</sup> December 1942, place Chicago and the New World was the first controlled nuclear fission. The coded communication was imperative since the second world war was going on. It was apprehended that Germany was trying to make nuclear bombs. Einstein at the instance of Szilard wrote to the US President Roosevelt in 1940 urging him to initiate research on nuclear bombs. That is how the Manhattan project came up where the first atom bomb was tested. Even in 1938 the greatest physicists in Europe were not sure whether fission reaction could actually take place until Lise Meitner, an outstanding physicist, hounded out by the Nazis for being a Jew, let down by her friend Otto Hahn whom she always helped in problem solving, showed mathematically that Nuclear fission was feasible. Enrico Fermi, who earned the Nobel prize when he was 37 years old came to settle in the US. He was allotted a disused squash court by the University of Chicago to carry out his experiments on nuclear fission.</p>

		<p>Fermi built his reactor with carbon blocks to slow down neutrons and ensure fission. He made arrangements to control the fission reaction and true to his expectations and much to the excitement of the Physicists around him, the reactor began to work. The first nuclear reactor was thus built in a disused squash court. In those days, the scientists were not aware of the damages radiations could cause. Fermi died of stomach cancer at the age of 53 and so did two of his research students, Madame Curie also fell a victim to the radiations that she was exposed to during years of experiments with radio activity as we mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>

		<p>True, that Fermi’s experiments helped the construction of the atom bomb but it also started off researches for producing electricity from nuclear fission. There are 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries today, providing 16% of the world’s electricity demand. In India we have 4780 MW of nuclear power generation which is less than 2% of India’s installed capacity for generating electricity.</p>
		<p>How does a nuclear reactor operate?</p>
		<p>The fuel used in a reactor is uranium. India, like her other energy resources, is short of uranium and has to import much of it even to keep our reactors in operation. The next requirement is the moderator which helps to slow down the neutrons. Heavy water is frequently used for this purpose. Next comes control rods used for controlling fission reaction which in turn controls the heat that needs to be produced. The heat generated is used for producing steam that turns a turbine. The turbine rotates the generator, much like a coal based system.</p>
		<p>In India Nuclear power very marginally helps to produce the basic demand of the day. The basic demand or the base load at present exceeds 100 GW. The demand reaches a peak in the morning for water heating and another peak in the evening, mainly for lighting loads. The base load is largely met from Thermal power. It is difficult to rely entirely on Hydroelectric power, since a failed monsoon may seriously jeopardize power supply situation. Since we intend to reduce our dependence on coal-based power plants over the years, we need some source of electrical energy to meet at least our base load. Until recently, it was our plan to increase Nuclear power generation, eventually depending on Thorium of which India has a very large deposit. It was the recent Fukushima Daiichi disaster which has made the world sit up and re-think plans of meeting the future energy needs with reduced dependence on nuclear power.</p>
		<p>The first nuclear disaster was at the Three mile Island in the US in 1979, followed by the one in Chernobyl (1986). These accidents alerted the scientists and engineers and measures of safety were enhanced significantly. The Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 has caused maximum concern among the planners. Unfortunately, the Tsunami happening at the same time greatly worsened the situation at Fukushima. The moot question now is whether Nuclear power should be enhanced or closed down as Germany has planned to close down all Nuclear reactors by 2022. France incidentally had more than 70% of its electrical energy coming from Nuclear reactors. It is now slowly phasing out its dependence on nuclear power.</p>

		<p>It is very difficult to come to any definite decision in India. The demand of electricity will go on increasing even if moderate economic growth has to be sustained and provide at least the minimum amount of electricity to the 400 million Indians who have no access to electricity. Where will this energy come from? Let us see.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">NUCLEAR FUSION</h2>
			<p>Nuclear energy may also be obtained from FUSION instead of Fission. In fission, a heavy atom is split and in Fusion two very light atoms are fused. In both cases a small mass loss produces large amounts of energy as discussed earlier. Some may not know that the Sun has an enormous Nuclear fusion reactor operating all the time. The fuel in this case is hydrogen.</p>
			<p>There are three isotopes of hydrogen as mentioned earlier. The basic form of hydrogen as we know has a single proton, one electron and no neutron and its other isotopes are <em>Deuterium</em> that has a proton <em>and</em> a neutron in the nucleus and the third variety which has two neutrons and one proton. It is called <em>Tritium</em>.</p>
			<p>If deuterium and tritium are <em>fused</em> or made to unite, we shall have two electrons in the first shell, two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus <em>which gives helium</em>, a very stable element.</p>
			<p>There is a mass loss and a huge energy production as a result of this fusion, mostly as heat.</p>
			<p>Inside the core of the sun, hydrogen atoms undergo some transitions and at an enormous pressure at about 15 million degrees kelvin, fuse into helium atoms. There is again a mass loss that turn into energy and believe me it is this fusion energy which for over 4.5 billion years is being radiated into space and keeping our planet nicely warm and half of it, facing the sun, brightly lighted up. This is expected to go on for another 5 billion years before our star, the sun runs out of its fuel, mostly hydrogen and becomes a dead star or a White dwarf. But that is a little far into the future for us to be worried about.</p>
			<p>Can we not produce energy by fusion since we believe we have sufficient amounts of deuterium and tritium freely available in nature, in sea water for instance. That should meet all our energy needs for millions of years. You must have heard of hydrogen bombs which are far more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. These are based on fusion energy. Decades of research have been going on but with limited success so far to produce controlled fusion energy, even in a laboratory, since we have to produce and contain plasma at about 80 million degrees of temperature for fusion to occur and that has been the biggest impediment so far.</p>
			<p>We are still far from our goal which as I just said, with very little side effects will meet our energy needs for millions of years. We have to keep trying but <strong><em>until such time let us keep using the energy being produced in a huge Fusion reactor 150 million kilometers away from us</em></strong>.</p>
