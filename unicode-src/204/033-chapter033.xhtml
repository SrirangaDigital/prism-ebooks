		<p class="text-center"><em>More on Global warming</em></p>
		<img src="images/130.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>We studied in an earlier section that most of the world’s energy resources are from conversion of the energy incident from the sun’s rays. Every day, for the last 4.5 billion years, almost 80 thousand trillion watts or terawatts (TW) of power has been lighting up and heating almost half the face of the earth for nearly 12 hours. Nearly half of the incident energy into the earth is reflected back from clouds and snow covered areas and also radiated back into space.</p>
		<p>The earth slowly became warm and reached a thermal equilibrium. Life began to thrive. Man began to burn wood and later fossil fuels. This produced carbon dioxide and methane, the green house gases, but there were enough trees to absorb carbon dioxide and the equilibrium continued. It was after the industrial revolution and all the inventions that we described so far gave us speed, electricity, comfort and entertainments. Our emphasis is on producing electricity which is the most clean and versatile form of energy at the point of use.</p>
		<p>We have been using up the fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas at such a rapid rate now that the fuels accumulated over million of years will run out in a few hundred years. Production of electricity has rapidly increased, primarily by burning coal. This has been leading to a huge production of carbon-dioxide.</p>
		<p>Carbon-dioxide and methane that are being produced cannot be absorbed at the same rate. The problem is made worse by the indiscriminate felling of trees. The earth is becoming a green house which we had described earlier. The earth and the oceans are absorbing some of the heat that are unable to escape into outer space. As a result, earth’s temperature is gradually increasing. This is described as Global Warming. It has been seen that the global mean temperature has increased by 0.7 degrees centigrade over the last century and is expected to slowly increase by 2 to 4 degrees. If drastic measures are not taken to slow down the use of fossil fuels, there may be extreme weather events and rapid melting of glaciers. When global temperature increases, the volume of water in the oceans will increase and the water level may increase as much as a metre in some places. Low lying countries like Maldives, Singapore, Bangladesh will be inundated and a significant land mass will go under water.</p>
		<p>Can we reduce our electricity generation? Not really. Once we get used to a certain level of convenience and comfort, we cannot easily come down from them. In fact the growth and prosperity of a nation have been found to be closely related to the consumption of electricity. Besides, our primary task is to light up homes of one third of our population who have no access to electricity and almost live like the cave men I had told you about during our visit to Kent’s cavern.</p>
		<p>All these would mean that more electricity needs to be produced and our installed capacity of about 250GW in India has to be doubled in 10 years although we have to keep making our energy use more efficient by reducing wastage.</p>
		<p>Since coal is our main energy source for producing electricity we cannot but use coal for several decades to come but it may cause irreparable damage to our environment.</p>
		<p>What is our choice?</p>
		<p>Nuclear energy may be considered to be an alternative source of energy, but it comes with its cost, its pollution and dreadful risks.</p>
		<p>We have belatedly awoken to the urgency of using alternative, renewable and non-polluting energy sources. Various studies have been made worldwide to estimate the potential of alternative energy. Some studies are overly ambitious and project a scenario where all our present and future energy use, much of which come as oil for transport, electricity for industries, domestic and commercial use, may be replaced within a couple of decades, by alternative energy sources such as Wind, Water and Solar (WWS). Electricity obtained from these sources will meet most of the needs, including a part for transport. At present the maximum power consumed world wide is 12.5 TW according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and is projected to reach 16.9 TW of power by 2030 as global population and living standards rise. The requirement will come down to 11.5 TW since in WWS without any fossil fuels, losses are much less. Out of this requirement Solar is estimated to provide 4.6TW, Wind 5.8 TW, Water including Tidal Turbines, Geothermal plants and Hydroelectric Plants to provide 1.1 TW.</p>
		<p>Other studies provide other estimates.</p>
		<p><em>What is a common concern is that business as usual will be catastrophic for this planet of ours</em></p>
		<p>Solar power may be used mainly in two ways. In one, sun <em>light</em> is directly converted into electricity using solar cells (<em>Photovoltaic cells</em>). In the other solar <em>heat</em> is concentrated to heat water to produce steam and generate electricity in the conventional way.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The History of using Solar Power</h2>
			<p>We started talking about the Sun being the source of almost all our energy but we have not discussed how men started using solar power to meet their needs. Using solar energy to dry food is almost as old as when men started growing food. Back to the 7<sup>th</sup> century before Christ there is evidence of men using sort of magnifying lenses to focus solar power and start a fire. As the story goes, Archimedes, the famous scientist and Philosopher, used the polished bronze shields used by soldiers to focus solar power and burn wooden ships from Rome trying to besiege Syracuse. That was in the year 212 B.C. The Greek navy tried to verify this in 1973 and recreate the situation. They did succeed in burning a wooden boat at a distance of 50 metres. Roman bath houses were heated using solar energy and the Roman aristocrats enjoyed the luxury of bathing there. In all theses attempts clever men tried to make use of solar power to heat or start a fire with a lens, a religious ritual in many countries a couple of thousand years back.</p>
			<p>A Swiss Scientist named Horace de Sanssure built the first solar collector in 1769 and Sir John Hershchel cooked in solar cookers that he improvised during his South African expedition in 1830.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS</em></h2>
			<p>What about producing electricity from sunlight?</p>
			<p>We had to wait for a 19 year old, born in 1820, to discover photo-electricity for the first time. He was Alexandre’ Edmond Becquerel (1820-1891) who belonged to an illustrious family of scientists in France. Edmond, as he was commonly called, was the son, a pupil and assistant of Antoine Cesar Becquerel, a distinguished physicist. Edmond helped his father in experiments and also carried out his own. Once he was working with Silver chloride in an acidic solution in an electrolytic cell and he noticed that a voltage appeared across two platinum electrodes immersed in the solution when light fell on the solution. The voltage disappeared when light was withdrawn. No one till then had noticed this and it came to be known as “Becquerel effect.”</p>
			<p>Many others like Heinrich Hertz experimented with photoelectric effect. Heinrich Hertz who was trying to see whether electromagnetic waves can travel through space as Clerk Maxwell had predicted mathematically, observed that ultraviolet rays affected the length of sparks in the gap of a metal ring when electromagnetic waves passed through the ring.</p>
			<p>Philipp Lenard, a Hungarian physicist took up experiments on Photoelectric emission and he found in 1902 that the energy of the photoelectrons emitted by shining light depended on the frequency of the light. This observation could not be explained by wave theory of light which was by then firmly established.</p>
			<p>It was then that Einstein came out with a bold theory (1905). He quantized light and proposed a <em>Corpuscular theory</em>. (By light we do not mean only the visible section but the entire electromagnetic spectrum that we have discussed earlier). If monochromatic light of frequency f passes through vacuum at velocity c, Einstein suggested that the light is made of packets or <em>quanta</em> of energy (later called <em>photons</em>) where the energy e of each <em>photon</em> is given by e=hf, h is Planck’s constant which relates the f of wave nature of light with its quantum nature (e) on the left side of the equation. Light of higher frequency is made of high energy <em>photons</em>. When light is more intense or the amplitude of the wave is large, it indicates there are large number of <em>photons</em>.</p>
			<p>Let us now try to understand <em>photoelectric effect</em> that had been experimentally observed by several scientists over decades.</p>
			<p>In the <em>photoelectric effect</em>,  electrons are emitted from a material when light is incident on its surface. An electron is ordinarily bound to the material unless sufficient energy is supplied for it to escape from the surface. In order to be emitted, an electron must receive from a <em>photon</em> a minimum amount of energy which is called the <em>Work Function</em> (W) of the surface. If the incident <em>photon</em> supplies energy that exceeds the work function, the electron escapes with greater kinetic energy given by e-W= hf-W. When light is shone on a shining metal plate, the knocked out electrons captured in an electric circuit produce a voltage difference which makes electric currents to flow. When the light is more intense there are more <em>photons</em> which knock out more electrons and that is how in a solar panel we receive maximum electrical energy during mid-day.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s theory was received with skepticism but proved to be right, paving the way to Quantum theory. Einstein received the Nobel prize in 1921 for his photoelectric theory.</p>
			<p>That sunlight can be used to produce electricity for commercial use and to be a major source of energy was beyond anyone’s dream at that time. It was in the year 1954 that Bell Laboratories made the first photovoltaic cell. The use of these cells for energy production was still far from being a commercial proposition until 1959 when Explorer satellite was launched with 1600 PV cells (1cm2cm each ) and served in charging up the battery inside. Solar cells became a regular feature in space satellites since in the absence of alternative sources, cost of the PV cells were inconsequential. Further researches led to more efficient solar cells and the cost has been progressively coming down.</p>
			<p>A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity (dc or direct current). The practical Silicon solar cells were developed in Bell Laboratories around 1960. Their efficiency has been improved from an initial 4% to over 25% which means, about one quarter of the incident solar energy may be converted into electricity. The electricity that may be produced from one square meter panel of solar cells is 250 Watts. In other words, 4 hectare (1ha=10,000 sq.metre) of solar panels can produce 1MW of power. Roof tops in domestic, commercial and office buildings are at present very marginally being used to install solar panels. The cost of solar panels have now come down to 7-8 crores per MW from 15 crores a couple of years ago, (as against about 3-5 crores for 1MW for coal-based power production) and is distinctly less than real costs of installing nuclear power plants.</p>
			<p>Solar power generation is non-uniform, starting from zero in the morning peaking at mid day and becoming zero again on sunset. On an average it provides 10-11hours of energy in tropical countries. The unusually low cost of fossil fuels, especially of oil till the “oil shocks” of 1973 and 1979, nations were complacent and very little work was done to promote alternative sources of energy which did not seem cost-effective.</p>
			<p>Solar panels need to be covered by glass to protect them from being abraded, especially in desert areas where sand storms are common. This adds to the cost.</p>
			<p>Solar energy not being available during evenings ought to be stored to meet the needs of lighting.</p>
			<p>Storage of solar energy in storage batteries enhances the cost significantly and has been a strong disincentive for the use of solar cells. The improvement in inverter and metering technology now enables direct current from solar panels to be inverted into ac to be “fed” into the grid, “for safe keeping”. Domestic users of solar panels may also “ store” energy in the grid system, drawing from there as required.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>SOLAR HEATING</em></h2>
			<p>A number of homes in India have installed solar heaters on the roofs and the morning peak load for water heating is partially reduced as a result. Apart from the distributed solar heaters for water heating, large scale use of heat from the sun to produce electricity is a serious option. Heat from the sun is concentrated in CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) and used to heat water to produce steam which in turn produces electricity in the usual way <em>without any carbon emissions</em>. The land mass required for using solar heat is about the same as in producing electricity from solar panels.</p>
			<p>Solar panels with PV cells are also fitted with tubes through which water is circulated. This achieves water heating and electricity production simultaneously and becomes more cost-effective.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>HYDROELECTRIC POWER</em></h2>
			<p>Hydroelectric power, the conventional ones, that we began our journey with into the electrical world has been exploited to a reasonably large extent. World over it exceeds 900 GW (1GW=1000MW) including small hydel plants of which China has 58%. Canada is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world. The trend in both Canada and the United States has been towards microhydel plants because these have negligible environmental impacts.</p>
			<p>Tidal energy is an energy form which does not originate in the sun. It comes mainly form earth-moon interaction. Tidal barrages are built to hold water during high tides and release at low tide. Considerable amount of renewable energy is inherent in it. Tidal turbines are to be used to produce electricity.</p>
