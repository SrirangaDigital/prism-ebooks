		<p class="text-center"><em>Wind Energy</em></p>
		<img src="images/132.jpg" alt="image"/>
		<p>If you visit some villages in the Netherlands or some islands in Greece, you will see old windmills still being used, not for producing electricity but mainly for threshing corns. In two earlier chapters we had learnt about wind, how it is produced and how it helped sailing across oceans.</p>
		<p>The potential of wind as a major alternative energy source has been recognized relatively recently and a 30% annual growth rate has been achieved. The present installed capacity exceeds 200 GW and the total amount of economically extractable power has been estimated to exceed the total installed capacity from all sources at present.</p>

		<p>Usually, a wind farm consists of 100 or more wind turbines in a row, feeding electricity to a common transmission system. The generators used are usually <em>Induction generators</em> which do not need a separate dc excitation. Unlike in solar cells, electricity generated by wind power is alternating current, feeding into an ac grid.</p>
		<p>Wind usually drops during the day and blows after evening. Hence wind power and solar power are complementary to each other, wind power being higher during evenings and night when solar power drops to zero. The plant load factor (plf) of wind power varies between 20 and 35 per cent. What is plant load factor? It is the ratio of the total units (kWh) of energy generated in a year divided by the total energy in kWh the generator can produce if it runs full capacity for the total number of hours in a year (8760 hrs.) It is estimated that wind energy provides 430 TWh of electrical energy globally at present. Nearly 19% of electricity used in Denmark comes from wind power. China, Europe and the United States have been making more use of wind power more than other countries and plan to enhance their wind power capabilities to a very significant extent.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>Storage of wind energy</em></h2>
			<p>It has been envisaged that with suitable transmission network wind energy during evenings may take over when solar power is unavailable. In view of the uncertainty of wind power availability, storage of energy is essential. <em>Pumped storage scheme </em>is a convenient way of storing electrical energy. In this scheme machines placed at lower levels pump water to a higher level when surplus power is available and stored in a reservoir. The stored water is allowed to run down and produce electricity when required. The motor/ pump system used to pump up water is used as turbine/ generator to produce electricity.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>Offshore Wind Power Generation</em></h2>
			<p>Europe leads the rest of the world in off shore wind power generation. There are 39 offshore wind farms already in operation in western Europe with 2396 MW installed capacity. More than 100 GW of offshore projects are already planned and being installed there. United Kingdom (UK) has a large number of offshore wind farms. Canada has been installing a number of offshore farms on the lakes and a 400MW of suspended wind farm is planned over the lake Ontario. Wind speed is usually higher over the sea and electricity is available for longer hours. Off shore wind farms are much less obtrusive than those onshore.</p>
			<p>Small onshore wind power, even those which are owned individually are being encouraged by electric companies which buy up or “store” wind power for smaller agencies.</p>
			<p>Solar Power and Wind power are planned as major sources of alternative energy and substantive investments are being made for both. Wind power costs about Rs 5 crores per MW, less than what solar power installation costs at present.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>Geothermal energy</em></h2>
			<p>Remember when we took a peep into the inside of the earth? We had seen hot gases and molten lava. There are places where geothermal energy erupts as volcanoes and hot water geysers where hot water mixed with steam gushes out. Geothermal energy may be used for producing heat and indirectly saving electricity used for heating water. Geothermal energy is also being used for producing electricity. The worldwide installed capacity for producing electricity adds upto 11GW as of now. Future projections vary as widely as 35GW to 2000GW.</p>

			<p>One of the major deterrents in extracting geothermal energy, apart from creating seismic disturbances, is emission of CO<sub>2</sub> which is about 400kg per MWh of energy. This is much less than that from a coal-based power plant but it brings forth other noxious gases like Methane, Hydrogen Sulphide and Ammonia.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>Ocean Thermal Energy</em></h2>
			<p>The temperature difference between the surface of the ocean and at a depth may be as high as 20 degree Celsius in tropical regions and may be utilized for energy production. A substance like Ammonia with low boiling point may be evaporated by using the difference in temperature and circulated to run an engine to produce electricity. This, however has low thermal efficiency.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><em>Bioenergy</em></h2>
			<p>Bioenergy or biofuels are used for producing electricity and also as bioethanol, a substitute for petrol. Bioenergy is derived from plants or plant waste which had absorbed energy from the sun and stored it. Bagasse, the fibrous waste of plants are used as fuel in furnaces to produce electricity. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel. Today it constitutes only a very small portion of the overall energy supply. Biomass electricity is on the rise in a number of European countries. The total installed capacity in the world is estimated at 50GW.</p>
			<p>Bioethanol is being produced in Brazil and US and biodiesel largely in Germany. Annual biofuel production in the world exceeds 50 billion litres.There is a concern that production of biofuel may affect food production in a country like India and needs to be planned carefully.</p>
			<p>Solar thermal and photovoltaic, offshore and onshore windpower, large and small hydropower will be the largest providers of alternative energy. Biofuels, Ocean energy, thermal and mechanical (tidal) will also provide their shares.</p>
