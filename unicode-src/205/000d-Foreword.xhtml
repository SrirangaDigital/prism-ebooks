<p class="text-center">RAJAJI ON RAMA RAO (1877 – 1960)<br />C. Rajagopalachari</p>
<p>Navaratna Rama Rao and I met in 1892 when we were both in our early teens in the Central College, Bangalore. I sought him out and left a letter in his room on the top of an eating house, asking for his friendship. Eating houses were of a wretched quality in those days and students who had no home in the city hired wretched rooms to sleep in and ate poor meals in what were called hotels which were as far from the hotels we know now as a twelve anna rush mat is from a Persian Carpet. My letter must have been a very boyish document. But in the romance of adolescence it was a serious adventure. I was attracted by his brains, his brightness, his lovable exterior, and by his being better read than all the rest of us in the college and as fond of great English literature as myself. Rama Rao accepted and we were friends from then on until death parted us on 27 November 1960 after sixty-eight years of unbroken attachment. We read a lot together—Byron, Shakespeare, Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thackeray, Dickens and many other classic authors’ books. He was the greater connoisseur of the two of us and his taste was superb and guided me like a mesmerist. We laughed and enjoyed humour and talked metaphysics and educated each other continuously. Our friendship was an astonishment and mystery to our college mates but they tolerated it and gathered round both of us in admiration.</p>
<p>My boyish instinct was right and I am thankful for it. Our mutual affection made us nobler and better and stronger and happier than either of us would have been without it. We were each the external life of the other as Valmiki puts it in respect of Lakshmana for Sri Rama. All life is a mystery and I realize it more and more every day and as one after another of my friends and colleagues pass out and I am left with increasing loneliness. Life is a mystery but love is the greatest mystery of all. Dear young men and women who read this, do as we two did, Rama Rao and I. We swore to ourselves each in his own mind that we should be friends for all life. And so we were all these nearly seventy years, one soul in two bodies and two lives in each body. This kind of friendship will keep you from sin, from all kinds of meanness. It will protect you like a guardian angel, against all evil, all unhappiness, all stepping down from the ideals of romantic youth.</p>
<p>Rama Rao’s life and mine ran on different tracks. What if? We were ever together, though others did not see it. Whatever each of us was doing and wherever we were, we were together in spirit. Pothen Joseph wrote last week “I know he is in deep mourning for a friend in Bangalore who had become a part of his own being.” That put it as briefly and truly as any English words can do it. Those who have not experienced true and full friendship must think it all nonsense. God bless them.</p>
<p>I saw my friend under Death’s black shadow on the ninth of November. The poison had gone to his head. He smiled in recognition but he was above the region of pain and away from normal expression. He was in delirium, uttering high things about the affairs of the world, about truth, and about many other things all incoherently. It was heart-rending to watch his best and most admirable intellect involved in incoherence. I asked a daughterin-law of his who sat by his bed to sing a Purandaradasa Kirtana. She did it beautifully. My friend’s eyes glistened. He stopped speaking and weakly struggled to bring his palms together in prayer. He looked grateful and sank into worship and silence. Never did I feel so happy.</p>
<p>The doctors gave up all hope and it was only a matter of a couple of days according to them. But he appeared to revive and astonished the medical men for a few days. Exactly a fortnight after I left him on the thirteenth of November to go to Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, I got a message when I was in Belgaum, that all was over. I made an all-night car journey from Belgaum to Bangalore and reached at dawn. But before that, the previous evening, my friend’s body had been according to ancient custom reduced to ashes and I could only walk round that cruel heap and make three perambulations for a last physical act of love. As the Isa Upanishad rishi sings “the breath has left to join the universal air and the body has turned into Bhasma,” “O mind,” as the rishi continues, “remember that only the works remain, only the works remain.”</p>
<p class="myquote">Om Krato smara Krtam smara<br />Krato smara Krtam smara.</p>
<p>And I returned from the cremation ground praying as the rishi did</p>
<p class="myquote">Agne naya supathaa raaye asmaan<br />Visvaani, deva, vayunaani vidvaan</p>
<p>O, Fire, thou who knowest all the paths, lead us in the right path, cleanse us and save us from sin, we entreat you over and over.</p>
