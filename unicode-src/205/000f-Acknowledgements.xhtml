<p>Our first note of gratitude goes to our late father Col N. Srinivasa Rao who suggested bringing out the English version. He also read the work in detail right through the translation and helped fill several gaps and made valuable suggestions. We remember with gratitude our eminent friend the late Dr. M.N. Srinivas who encouraged our work at every stage. Our cousin, the late Navaratna Narayana Murthy placed before us the results of his own extensive research into the origins of the Navaratna family and its name. Several of Rajaram’s American friends read the manuscript and offered helpful suggestions. Among these, Dr. Rosalie Wolfe (nee Nerheim) of Chicago and Dr. Jomana Amara of Houston (now at the Naval Postgraduate School) merit special mention. The beautiful jacket design was created by Prabal Media and Marketing under Mahesh Prabhu. To all these, we are grateful. Our debt to Rama Rao’s youngest son Navaratna Lakshman is especially great for keeping the Kannada version is continued publication without which the present work would have been impossible.</p>
