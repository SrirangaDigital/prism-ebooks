		<p>Navaratna Rama Rao is remembered today chiefly as C. Rajagopalachari's closest friend and his collaborator in the popular English versions of the ‘Ramayana’ and the ‘Mahabharata’. He was, however, an important figure in his own right – a high official and influential cultural figure in the princely state of Mysore in the first half of this century. He was a visionary and an administrator of exceptional ability who was mainly responsible for establishing the silk industry in Mysore on a firm footing, making it the leading revenue producer and the largest private employer in the state. It became the model for Central Silk Board established by Government of India and served as its first Vice Chairman (with the Industries Minister Shyam Prasad Mukherji as Chairman, ex-officio.) The present state of Karnataka continues to benefit from his work by being the largest producer of silk in the country. He was one of the officials of the kind who brought Mysore the reputation of being the “model state”. Rulers of other princely states used to send their princes and promising officials to Mysore in an attempt to emulate its excellence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-000g-01">1 </a></sup></p>
		<p>While this by itself is sufficient to secure for him a place in history, his reputation today rests on his literary work, notably his great memoir – ‘Kelavu Nenapugalu’ ("Some Remeniscences"). Written in Kannada, it chronicles his experiences as a young official in the Maharaja's government in the first decade of the twentieth century. There is of course no shortage of memoirs written about the Raj, but Navaratna Rama Rao's Memoir is unique in several respects. Though written in a state ruled by a Maharaja, it is a work about the common people and their daily life, rather than a record of the deeds and misdeeds of princes and potentates; even when a prince or a Diwan puts in an appearance, he is only incidental to the story. No less interestingly, it was written about the people of Mysore by a man who was one of them whom the people loved and trusted, and who in turn loved and trusted them. His readers too were fellow Mysoreans, of a later generation to be sure, but sharing the same history and traditions. They were his people; he was one of them. As a result, what we find in his writing is involvement, not detachment. This has made it a valuable source for sociologists and other scholars, though that was not his intention. Above all, it is a hugely entertaining work which has never lost its popularity in the fifty years since its appearance. It has been compared to Axel Munthe’s famous ‘Story of San Michel’, but Rama Rao’s work is distinguished by an intimacy and involvement that are not found in Munthe’s work; the range of characters and events chronicled is also much wider. In a sense it is less a personal memoir than an unusually vivid chronicle of an era that has disappeared forever.</p>
		<p>To go with this, he was the friend, mentor, and sometimes patron of important literary and artistic figures of the period. They included such distinguished writers as Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, D.V. Gundappa, A.N. Krishna Rao, K.M. Munshi, C. Rajagopalachari himself as well as musicians like Veena Seshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Tiger Varadachar, T. Chowdiah, M.S. Subbu Lakshmi and many others of distinction. Masti, in particular, regarded him as his teacher. Rama Rao was widely read in English, Kannada, Sanskrit, and French. He had published articles on Shakespeare and was recognized as an authority the world over. He was also an accomplished amateur violinist. To cap it all, while serving as Amildar of T. Narsipur, he led an archaeological expedition that resulted in the restoration of five ancient temples. Even this, he approached not as an antiquarian, but as a Hindu to whom the restoration of these temples was part of a living tradition. All in all, he was a true figure of the Indian Renaissance, whose study of Western literature and culture left a mark on his own work, and on India. His work with Rajaji on the two great Indian epics is sufficient testimony to the fact.</p>

		<p>What we have presented here is a retelling of his Memoir in English. We call it a retelling rather than translation because we have found it necessary to selectively reorganize the original work. A straight translation presents significant linguistic, historical, and structural problems. A substantial part of the book is conversational in style and content in which the author reproduces the various dialects and accents then prevailing in Kannada. This makes it a valuable source for students of social history, but also impossible to reproduce in English. Next, his work was begun in 1951 – or less than five years after the disappearance of the Raj and Princely Rule. The titular Maharaja was still a beloved figure and the administration and the society not notably different from the time when he was still ruling. He could, therefore, assume on the part of his readers knowledge of the social and political conditions of the era that we today cannot. Finally, his Memoir appeared as a series of articles in the now defunct literary magazine Jeevana, which made it somewhat disjointed in structure; it also contains some material that is of little interest today. Taking these into consideration, we have introduced some structural changes and occasional explanations where necessary, always making them as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
		<p>Navaratna Rama Rao’s Memoir covers his experiences during the period from 1904 to 1909, with forays into earlier and later periods. As just noted it is not so much an autobiography as a record of events and personalities that he encountered and dealt with. For this reason, in the present retelling, we have organized it into chapters that highlight events and personalities. This has been supplemented wherever necessary by administrative and other details of Mysore that were familiar to readers when these stories first appeared, but not to most readers today.</p>
		<p>In addition, Rajaram was extremely close to Rama Rao in the last years of his life, which allowed him to gather numerous details about events and personalities that were left out in the original. He heard the same stories told and retold in more detail and with less reserve. (We have on occasion used some other sources including his biography by Masti and records and recollections of his friends and family members, especially Rama Rao’s eldest son Srinivasa Rao.) These have been included wherever found suitable. We would like to point out however, that these only highlight a few minor aspects of the story in question without changing anything of substance.</p>
		<p>Though studied by scholars today for its sociological interest, it was written mainly to be enjoyed, for Rama Rao was a wonderful storyteller. And this is the spirit that we have tried to bring to our translation also. If it turns out to be of historical and sociological interest, well, it is purely incidental. We will consider our retelling a success if it proves to be enjoyable reading.</p>
