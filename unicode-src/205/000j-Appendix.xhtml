<p>Rama Rao often mentioned his Central College Professor John Guthrie Tait and classmate C. Rajagopalachari as the two men to whom he was most indebted for his growth from a provincial youth steeped in tradition and orthodoxy into the Renaissance man that he became. But it was Tait far more than Rajagoplachari who was responsible for this transformation: the latter came from a background similar to Ram Rao’s a traditional South Indian Brahmin family that he would never fully escape; he could not have opened the vistas that broadened horizons to the extent Tait did. Rama Rao made his debt to Tait explicit in a talk he gave at his old Alma Mater, the Bangalore Central College on June 7, 1952.</p>
<p>Of all the dear and honored names I have mentioned, I would, this evening, select for a few words one which is to me personally sacred– that of my revered Master, Tait. I owe to him–next to God and to my beloved parents–all that has made my life worth living; but that is not the only, nor even the main, reason why I would speak of him this evening. He has a great claim on the gratitude of this college and this country. He spent thirty years of the best part of his life here, and gave without stint himself and his unsurpassed talents to the service of this College; and he left it as high in prestige as the proudest in India– great in learning and culture, great in sport and sportsmanship. He implanted in us not only a love of learning but also a code of honor and duty.</p>
<p>To me no college celebration is complete without a tribute of gratitude to him. There were people who thought him hard and cynical, but that was only the conventional crust of the Britisher which hides warmth of heart. He also made no concealment of his faith in the inherent superiority of the White Man, but that was the fault of the conservative creed of his day, and with him it admitted of large and generous exceptions in favor of his students, and of Indians he really knew. I have lived longer than the ordinary span of human life, and met and known some great and famous men. But, I don’t think I have met or known one with a nobler, manlier heart or a more virile understanding.</p>
<p>The point Rama Rao makes about Tait’s firm faith in the superiority of the White Man is interesting; it was a belief that he discarded once a personal relationship based on trust and mutual respect was established. So it was not racial prejudice but a sense of the cultural superiority of the ‘White’ meaning Western civilization. Tait was not alone in this attitude. Louis Benjamin Rice, who founded the Mysore Archaeology Department and published the famous Epigraphica Carnatica with thousands of inscriptions, also trained numerous Indian assistants. Rice freely acknowledged that some of his juniors (like Narasimhachar) surpassed him and took much pleasure in their achievements. Anyone who has been a teacher and guide, especially at the postgraduate level will understand the feeling. Enlightened, educated Britishers like Tait firmly believed it was their sacred duty to educate Indians who represented a once great but now degraded civilization and help them rise to their true potential. It is worth taking a look at this remarkable man.</p>
<p>John Guthrie Tait (1861 – 1945) came from an illustrious Scottish family. In some ways John is the least famous of the three men from the Tait family whose names have survived in history. His father Peter Guthrie Tait (1831 – 1901) was a leading mathematical physicist of the time. He collaborated with such greats as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and William Rowan Hamilton. While not rising to their level as a scientist, P.G. Tait was a highly respected teacher and author of several important works on mathematical physics. John’s younger brother Frederick was twice British Amateur golf champion (1896, 98) and came close to winning it a third time before losing to John Ball in the finals in 1899. Frederick Tait went on to graduate from the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy and was posted in South Africa where he is believed to have introduced golf and founded the first golf club in the country. He seemed destined for greatness but his promising career was cut short when he was killed in action at Koodoosberg during the Second Boer War.</p>
<p>In addition to education, what brought Tait and Rama Rao together was their interest in sports. Tait was an avid sportsman who had played</p>
<p class="inlay">Indian education owes much to people like Tait and Rice. Even the much maligned Thomas Babbington Macaulay who introduced English education in India had an enlightened streak. When cautioned that ideas he was introducing might one day make Indians demand constitutional rights and even freedom, Macaulay retorted – “It will be our proudest day.” (Just contrast this with the record of the centuries of alien rule prior to it that plunged India into a Dark Age from which it is only now coming out.)</p>
<p class="inlay">It would be wrong to dismiss it as racial prejudice and ignore the real contribution of pioneers like Tait and Rice. Tait in particular came from a distinguished and affluent family and was not one of those adventurers in search of a quick fortune. (The latter breed is not unknown today, sometimes at the highest levels. It is never mentioned that unlike the British these neo-colonialists have contributed nothing to education, science or culture which even the Soviets did.)</p>
<p class="inlay">Swami Vivekananda put it pithily: “Serve man to serve God.”</p>

<p>Rugby for Cambridge and Scotland. He was also a dedicated golfer though nowhere near as proficient as his younger brother Frederick. As Rama Rao recounted with self-deprecating humor: “As a youngster my grave self-dedication to the game [cricket] was what brought me to Mr. Tait’s notice, by amusing him greatly. On the rare occasions on which I hit a ball hard, he used to clap his hands with humorous enthusiasm and shout ‘Hip, Hip, Hurray! Three cheers for Navaratnam!’ He knew and liked me as a cricket enthusiast before I did anything worth his notice at my studies, and, though I haven’t done so badly at the latter, I get greater joy out of the memory of my undistinguished cricket deeds.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that his self-deprecation notwithstanding, Rama Rao was himself an excellent athlete, particularly outstanding in wrestling in which he was close to professional level. It is a matter of satisfaction that Tait lived long enough (1945) to see his favorite students Rama Rao and Rajagopalachari rise to eminence. He was particularly happy when Rama Rao’s eldest son Srinivasa Rao enlisted during World War II. Though Indian by birth, he was given a King’s Commission instead of the Viceroy’s Commission as was usual with Indians. He was also assigned as medical officer to the Gurkha Regiment</p>
<p>– an honor rarely given to Indian recruits. It cannot be confirmed but it is possible that Tait had a hand in this unusual assignment: Tait had served as a lieutenant colonel in World War I and might have put in a word. (Srinivasa Rao was a British national until he returned to India from medical studies in England in 1949 and took up Indian citizenship. Things were a bit fluid then with India having gained independence only two years before.)</p>
<p>With Rama Rao’s other great friendship, with Rajagopalachari (Rajaji or CR) we find ourselves in the strange situation of having many more sources of knowledge but less clearly discernible influence. Several family members still living (including Rajaram) knew them both personally and had the opportunity to observe them close. Whenever he visited Bangalore or Mysore, even while serving as India’s Governor General, Rajaji stayed as Rama Rao’s guest at his home. Based on this observation it may safely be said that Tait’s influence on Rama Rao greatly exceeded Rajaji’s. While their friendship endured, their paths diverged. Rajaji became a Congressman and follower of Mahatma Gandhi while Rama Rao was and remained an anglophile all through his life. (So was Rajaji but in a more superficial way, definitely not his lifestyle.) Late in life Rama Rao believed India would one day emerge as a great power but disapproved of the Gandhian path which he saw as a futile attempt to return to an imagined past. He felt that India should build on what it had inherited from the British supplemented by India’s own cultural and social foundations.</p>
<p>Rama Rao disapproved also of Rajaji’s leadership of the conservative Swatantra Party which he saw as elitist and reactionary and out of touch with the needs and aspirations of the common people. Rama Rao’s long years of service had given him insight into this aspect while Rajaji had gone directly from law practice into the Freedom Movement and tended to work better with ideas than with people. He had no mass following but was respected for his intelligence and sharp analytical mind. He was a brilliant administrator but so was Rama Rao. Their strong bond of friendship rested on shared values, interests and culture. They were both devout but by no means orthodox Hindus. Both believed in reform – and Rama Rao later married a woman from a different (non-Brahmin) community. Their shared experience found expression mainly in their literary work, especially their translations of the two great Indian epics. While Tait and Rama Rao had similar personalities, it was noticeably different from Rajagopalachari’s.</p>
<p>For those observing the two men it appeared that the friendship was of greater significance to Rajagopalachari than to Rama Rao. This could be because of the very different lives they led. Rama Rao had a stable career and family life always surrounded by friends and family. Rajaji’s life was frequently interrupted by his political activities and imprisonments due to his participation in the Freedom Movement. He lost his wife early (1916) and unlike Rama Rao did not remarry. But there was more. While not cold as some thought, he lacked Rama Rao’s natural spontaneity and warmth that attracted friends from all strata of society. Where people loved Rama Rao, they admired Rajaji— his intellect, logic and above all his uncompromisingly sharp analytical mind. This is not a nature that is conducive to forming friendships. Anyway, here is what Rama Rao had to say in 1952 about Rajaji and their friendship of six decades. It is interesting to compare it with what Rajaji wrote in his obituary of Rama Rao reproduced earlier:</p>

<p>When I try to tell you something about Sri C. Rajagopalachari, I feel strangely troubled. I have known him intimately these sixty years and more; yet every time I see him, I see in him traits I had not noticed before. I have felt the same in rereading my favourite plays in Shakespeare, and I attribute it to a maturing of my own perception by experience. It may be so in the other case also, but it is more probably due to the gradual unfolding of C. Rajagopalachari’s natural gifts under the stimulus of opportunity and a demand for their exercise.</p>
<p>Together we lived in Bangalore and Madras, reading the same books, thinking the same thoughts, dreaming the same dreams, eating the same wretched food in the hotels of those days, living in the same dingy rooms, and as far as possible spending our holidays with one another. We had mapped our future to practice at the same Bar, and accordingly after taking my Law Degree I went to Salem where he was waiting for me. After about a couple of years there, our ways parted. I gravitated to Mysore and the Civil Service, and he went on, with singleness of aim, following faithfully the light that led him,… He accepted glory without exultation as he had gone to jail without plaint or repining. Elevated to a position never held by an Indian before [of Governor General], and in the midst of the almost barbaric gorgeousness of a Government House, which had been designed to gratify the vainglory of foreign satraps, he remained unaffected and unchanged…</p>
<p>His Excellency K. M. Munshi calls him one of the greatest of living Indians, and hardly any will contradict him. I have as I have told you, known him long and closely, and ordinarily such intimacy is not conducive to hero-worship. Yet, he has seemed to me one of those philosopher-statesmen that our country has produced in times of crisis</p>
<p>– Kautilya, Vidyaranya, Vyasa Raya, Mahatma Gandhi. He has a strong, disciplined intellect which can pierce to the very heart of a tangled problem and find a statesmanlike solution where ordinary minds would be mazed with mere details. Most of us have heard him speak and know how he can hold and convince his audience.</p>
<p>He is one of the most versatile men I know. If he had not dedicated himself to politics, he might have been a great jurist or a distinguished literary man. As it is, in the scanty leisure of a crowded life, he has produced works in Tamil and English which his countrymen will long read and admire. Perhaps the most important constituent of C. R’s greatness is his utter fearlessness when he sees his duty clear before him. This Courage has its spring in his deeply religious nature. Religion with him is by no means doxy or dogma. It is Faith in God and Dharma.</p>
<p>Rama Rao closed his tribute by quoting Wordsworth’s famous poem. “To my mind, he is the Happy Warrior</p>
<p>“Who hath wrought<br /> Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:<br /> Who, if he rise to station of command,<br /> Rises by open means, and there will stand<br /> On honourable terms, or else retire;<br />Or if an unexpected call succeed,<br /> Come when it will, is equal to the need;<br /> Who, lifted high <br />Or left unthought-of in obscurity,<br /> Plays, in the many games of life, that one<br /> Where that which he most values may be won.”</p>
<p>To this tribute – and to the one Rajaji wrote for his friend, we only say ‘Amen’ and pray may India produce many more like them.</p>
