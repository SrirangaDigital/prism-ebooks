<p><strong><em>Background to the time and place of the era. Rama Rao and his family. His friendship with Tait and Rajaji. Diwan Krishna Murthy's invitation to Rama Rao. The beginning of his service in the Maharaja's Government. </em></strong></p>
<p>The stories that I have to tell in these pages date back to the year 1900 or thereabouts. It was the high noon of the British Raj. Queen Victoria was Empress of India. The state of Mysore, in which my Navaratna ancestors had been domiciled since the seventeenth century, was then being ruled by our dear late lord, Maharaja Krishna Raja IV of the ancient Wodeyar dynasty. Actually, the Maharaja was still a minor, and his mother, Her Highness Vani Vilas ruled as regent. Sir K. Seshadri Iyer was the prime minister or Diwan, as he was officially known; but the Diwan was subject to bouts of illness that was shortly to kill him and Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy – a family friend of ours – was frequently called upon to act in his place. And it was Krishna Murthy, who in a way was responsible for my giving up my law practice and joining the Mysore Government under his administration. This in turn was to lead to the adventures that I will now relate.</p>
<p>There are not many people living today (1951) who remember those days. To those like me who do, the world looks very different indeed! The earth, the sky, the very universe seem in the past half century to have changed beyond recognition. Kingdoms and empires that then seemed as permanent as mountains have dissolved like dreams. The science we studied in college reads now like a badly-written fairy tale. Political, social, and worldly beliefs we then held to be high truths seem now like the superstitions of a primitive age. We, who then prided ourselves as the subjects of the greatest empire in the world, now with re-awakened interest in our own ancient history and culture recognize there is much the world can learn from us. British Raj is now history; the King of England is no more the Emperor of India; and the Wodeyar dynasty no longer rules Mysore.</p>
<p>It is not my intention, however, to describe all the changes that I have seen take place in the past fifty years and more; though, that in itself, would doubtless make for an interesting story. My goal in these pages is to recapture for you a general sense of the time and place in my country in the early years of this century – sketch some scenes, recreate some events, and portray characters from all walks of life, before the very memory of the era is lost forever in the mists of time.</p>
<p>My story begins in the year 1892, when I joined the Central College in Bangalore, majoring in science or PCM – physics, chemistry and mathematics—as such majors were then designated. And there, it was my great good fortune to acquire two friendships that have enriched my life beyond measure. The first of these was of my great friend, teacher, Guru, mentor, and benefactor, Professor John G. Tait; the other, of my life-long friend Rajaji (C. Rajagopalachari), later to be one of India's immortal national leaders, and to serve as her last Governor General.</p>

<p>Had these two great men not entered my life when they did, filling it with love and zest, firing my imagination, and opening horizons beyond the limited environs of my own childhood and adolescence, my life might have taken an altogether different course. And to them, and especially to Tait, I owe a debt of gratitude that I can never repay. He was a second father to me, a man whom I revere next only to God.</p>
<p>After graduating from the Central College in Bangalore, Rajaji and I both went to Madras to study law. My father, by then, was a senior official with a good income, but supporting my education in the Madras Law College was still something of a burden – something I came to appreciate only when I had to educate my children. We were a large family, and my father was the only wage earner.</p>
<p>Despite such economic hardships, I count my college days in Madras as one of the happiest times in my life. There was no limit to the scope of our philosophy or the sweep of our imagination. The Boer War was raging at the time, and a fellow student who once needed to borrow some clean clothes from me for a job interview, prefaced his request with the remark that the idiot Chamberlain had brought disgrace on all of us by provoking the Boers! This gives some idea of how many Indians those days identified themselves with the British; for the most part, the nationalist movement was still in the future.</p>
<p>Among my closest friends then was Dasappa of Hadya, one of the most brilliant men I have known. His life was tragically cut short when he was accidentally drowned in 1904. His was an extrovert personality with an outrageous sense of humor, which manifested itself in the most unexpected ways. Here is an example that is still vivid in my memory.</p>
<p class="inlay">It is not necessary to go into the details of this tragedy beyond noting that his wife Kamalamma Dasappa stood helplessly by as her husband was swept away by the rushing flood. More details can be found in the Kannada original. But the brave lady took the tragedy in her stride and became a pioneer in women’s education in Mysore. The well-known women’s institution known as Mahila Seva Samaj in Bangalore is partly her work.</p>
<p>A major problem we all faced then was finding some decent eateries that were also affordable. For the most part, they were of wretched quality, and did not remotely provide the kind of food and service that we take for granted in restaurants today. There was one establishment in particular that Dasappa and I used to frequent. It used to be run by a fellow by name Shankara Iyer. His customers were mostly people from out of town on limited budgets, that is to say, students like us who had few other options. He economized on everything by buying the cheapest possible ingredients that could be found.</p>
<p>One evening, after having been forced to endure particularly atrocious fare, Dasappa asked to see the cook. As Shankara Iyer stepped into the dining area, Dasappa stood up, threw his arms around the cook, and burst into sobs. We were aghast. Shankara Iyer was flabbergasted. Someone asked Dasappa if there had been a tragedy like a death in the family.</p>
<p>"No, something far worse," replied my friend still sobbing uncontrollably. "I have known many rotten cooks but none to compare with this fellow – Shankara Iyer. He's a peerless artist – in a class all by himself. If he should eat some of his own preparation today and die of it, where in the world are we going to find another like him? Isn't that a loss great enough to mourn?"</p>
<p>This carefree existence was jolted one day, by a telegram from my father asking me to come to Mysore to meet with Diwan Krishna Murthy. The Diwan himself had asked for the meeting. This was in the year 1900 or 1901. <strong>[Sic: </strong>It was 1901, going by Rama Rao’s law certificate. <strong>NSR] </strong>The Diwan was the highest official in the realm; it was not every day that a college student like me got invited to meet him. I assumed that the reason was he wanted me to work for him. I knew that appointments of assistant commissioner (deputy collector) were made on the basis of qualifications and family reputation. I assumed I was being considered for one of those positions. When one of my friends brought up the possibility, I told him that my head was too large to make an entry through the back door. Actually, I was hoping that it might happen, but was making a ‘pre-emptive excuse’ like the fox in the story ‘Sour Grapes’!</p>
<p>I left for Mysore by train immediately. On the appointed day, my father and I went to see Krishna Murthy in his house. The Diwan's offices were in Bangalore, which was the administrative capital, but he also used to maintain a house in Mysore – the Maharaja’s seat – that he often visited on official work. He had a long line of visitors, and we had to wait quite a while. It was late in the afternoon by the time we were ushered into his presence.</p>
<p>The Diwan’s visit to any place was no ordinary event. His whole entourage consisting of servants, officials, cooks, and just plain hangers-on, descended on the place like locusts. Whenever the Diwan graced some village with his attention, it took the hapless place a month or more to recover from the onslaught. It was not that the Diwan went to torment the people. His intentions were noble – to see firsthand the problems of the people and help them. But to those who had to host him, it was the kindness of a bear that patted the baby’s face with its paw to shoo away the fly sitting there!</p>
<p>It was different in Mysore where the Diwan had his own establishment. We found the Diwan seated in a massive chair in the company of his younger brother Purniya and one or two others. As soon as my father was announced, he came up and saluted him, leading him to a seat nearby. The long wait, the fatigue of the three hundred mile journey from Madras, my own youthful impatience – had all combined to put me in ill-humour. To make matters worse, the Diwan seemed oblivious to my presence. He was wholly occupied with talking to my father. I noticed that he treated my father with a great deal of respect.</p>

<p class="inlay"><em><strong>Diwan Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy (1849 -1912)</strong></em></p>
<p class="inlay"><em>A family friend going back several generations, he was responsible for Navaratna Rama Rao giving up his law practice in Salem to join the Mysore Government.</em></p>
<p class="inlay"><em>Krishna Murthy was a direct descendant (great-great grandson) of the famous Diwan Purnaiah (1746 1812) who held high positions under the Mysore rulers Hyder and Tipu Sultan and later under the restored Maharaja Krishna Raja III when he served as regent and virtual ruler of the Kingdom. D.V. Gundappa in his book of Diwans wrongly writes Krishna Murthy was Purnaiah's grandson. This error has been carried over by other writers (which we hope will be corrected henceforth). A man of progressive ideas, he helped and supported Jamsetji Tata in his efforts to set up the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.</em></p>
<p>Diwan Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy – better-known by his title as Jagirdar of Yelandur – was a short, somewhat portly man of about fifty, of plain appearance and fair complexion, with a black moustache. He was simply dressed, in the fashion of the day, wearing a black close-collared long coat and a white silk turban. Despite his unprepossessing appearance, his bearing was dignified yet unassuming, and his speech soft. He was one of the first graduates of the Bangalore Central College, had had a distinguished academic record, and was said to be one of the people responsible for getting Tait to his alma mater. The conversation went on in Kannada and Marathi, for my father did not know English well. After what seemed to me like an eternity, he finally asked my father:</p>
<p>"Have you sent for your son? Is he here?"</p>
<p>I was standing close by, as conspicuous as a large gorilla and his remarks did nothing to improve my humor. I drew attention to myself by bowing and saluting him with folded hands, with exaggerated politeness. The Diwan peered at me through his glasses. His eyesight was poor, but I did not know it at the time.</p>
<p>"Sit down, please sit down!" said the Diwan graciously, pointing to a chair next to him.</p>
<p>He then went on to recount the high regard in which he held my father as well my other ancestors for their services to the people through several generations. He also told me that he had heard many good things about me from my teachers and others. Then somewhat to my surprise, he complimented me on my English.</p>
<p>"I keep hearing good things about you from Tait and other people I know," said the Diwan. "Your father is very dear to us. I have seen you ever since you were a boy. You write excellent English. A person of your talents can be a valuable asset in the Government."</p>
<p>To show his regard for my father, the Diwan continued, he wanted to help me by offering me a promising position in his Government. I had come with the expectation of a high position like assistant commissioner, but the tune of his speech did not sound like the prelude to such an exalted offer. Rather brusquely, I asked him for more details about his job offer. The Diwan frowned a little at my bluntness, but took the time to explain that he wanted me in his own office, to work as his personal aide and speechwriter. Newcomers to his office would normally be offered twenty rupees a month, but he was prepared start me on a salary of fifty.</p>
<p>My hope of becoming assistant commissioner crashed abruptly. It was only to be a staff position – way beneath what I thought I was worth. I was thoroughly disenchanted. I rejected his offer outright, pointing out that I was a law student doing quite well in my studies.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” the Diwan shrugged, “whatever pleases you.”</p>
<p>My behavior must have struck those present in the room as imprudent. The Diwan's brother Purniya seemed especially peeved. As we stood up to leave, Purniya muttered under his breath, but in a tone meant to be perfectly audible to everyone:</p>
<p>"If you say 'no' when it is offered to you, you may not get a chance to say 'yes' when you come back asking for it!"</p>
<p>This was too much for me.</p>
<p>“You should have saved your comment for the occasion when I did come back asking for it," I shot back, making no attempt to hide my annoyance.</p>
<p>The Diwan must have heard my retort. He just smiled and wished me luck in my studies. I came out of the meeting with increased respect for Diwan Krishna Murthy, especially for his good-natured tolerance of my own somewhat imprudent behavior. My father seemed a little unhappy, but didn't say a word on our way back. But later, upon reflection, he seemed to agree with my decision.</p>

<p class="inlay"><strong><em>Rama Rao's father Navaratna Balakrishna Rao (c.1840 - 1925) </em></strong></p>
<p>This is from an old group photo taken around 1900 when he was about 60 years or a little older. He was said to be exceptionally good looking as a young man which the photo also suggests. He was the first member of the family to leave the religious seat and take up outside employment. Rama Rao was the son of Balakrishna Rao and Brahmani Bai who died young. Unfortunately no photo of hers is known. (Those days it was rare for anyone to be photographed).</p>
<p>"He has no worldly sense," I overheard him telling my stepmother that evening, speaking in Marathi. "But look at his spirit – saying 'no' to the Diwan right to his face! It may be that God has a great future in store for my son."</p>
<p>My father was a man of spirit and courage who had known and overcome adversity. He admired the same attitude in others. I was relieved to find that though perhaps a little annoyed at my behavior, he seemed to agree with my decision.</p>
<p>I returned to Madras the following day. About a year later, I passed my law exams. Rajaji had set up a law practice in Salem in British India. I followed suit. It is worth noting that Mysore, though officially part of the British Empire, was a semi-independent kingdom ruled by its own Maharaja. According to the terms of a treaty signed between the British and Maharaja Krishna Raja III (in 1799), the British were responsible for defense and foreign affairs, while the Maharaja's Government was responsible for domestic affairs. Madras and Salem on the other hand, were in the part of India under direct British administration, i.e., in the territory commonly referred to as British India.</p>
<p>I ran a successful practice in Salem, but my wife – Kashija Bai of Kallambilla – did not like the place. By then we had two daughters – Brahmani and Venku – and the hot and humid climate of Salem did not suit my wife. She longed to return to the cool uplands of Mysore that was our home. During these years Diwan Krishna Murthy had kept in touch with me through my father. Then, in 1903 or 1904, the Diwan's office contacted me again with the formal offer of the position of revenue probationer in the Government of Mysore. It was a stepping-stone to higher offices later, and much better than the Diwan's earlier offer. I was later to learn that this offer was partly the result of my performance in the Mysore Civil Service exams that I had taken about a year earlier at my father's behest. I was at first reluctant to give up my practice; but my wife and father both insisted. I finally accepted the offer. My wife and daughters left for Mysore. After closing my practice in Salem, I too returned to Mysore.</p>
