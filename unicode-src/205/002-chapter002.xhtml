<p><strong><em>Visiting the Diwan in Bangalore. Councillor Madhava Rao. Meeting Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs and V.V. Iyengar. Mohammed of Ghazni intrudes on a court hearing. V.V. Iyengar and his sense of ‘honesty’. </em></strong></p>
<p>I have already related how when I rejected the Diwan's offer, his brother Purniya had admonished me: "If you say 'no' when it is offered to you, you may not get a chance to say 'yes' when you come back asking for it."</p>
<p>But Purnaiah had been wrong. His government had offered me a better position than before without my applying for it. I had been appointed revenue probationer, assigned to the office of the deputy commissioner (DC) in Mysore. (It is not necessary at this time to know what exactly that meant; I’ll explain it later on when necessary.) I was asked to report for duty in the DC's office in Mysore. I decided to stop for a few days in Bangalore and visit Tait, Diwan Krishna Murthy, and a few other senior friends. I first went to see the Diwan in his house ‘Purna Prasada’, meaning gift of Purnaiah. Purnaiah (see picture) was his famous ancestor who had been Diwan under Hyder and Tippu and established the family reputation. (It is also a pun on 'Purna' which refers to Madhvacharya, the founder of the sect to which the Diwan and I belonged.) It still exists and goes by the same name. But to those who knew it during its glory days, it is no more like its former self than a broken kerosene lantern is to a crystal chandelier.</p>
<p>I was shown in almost immediately. Krishna Murthy was seated at his desk, busy writing.</p>
<p>"I am very pleased to see you again, Navaratna Raoji," he said with a slightly mischievous smile as he greeted me. "You decided to return to us after all!"</p>
<img src="images/0014.jpg" alt="image" />	
<p>“You were kind enough to send for me," I replied with all the humility I could muster (which was not much). "I could hardly refuse."</p>
<p>I thanked him for his continued interest and took his leave. He was a man of great distinction. His great-great-grandfather Purnaiah (1746-1814) had been Diwan under Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan during their usurpation, and later under the restored Wodeyar ruler Krishna Raja III, when he had also served as regent and virtual ruler of Mysore. Krishna Murthy was by temperament a scholar and intellectual who went into government service with a sense of duty towards his people and the Maharaja. Mysore had been restored to the Wodeyars only in 1881 when Krishna Murthy was about thirty years old, and his patriotism and sense of duty made him devote most of his life to public service. He was a man of the highest principles, never to swerve from the path he believed to be true and just. After all these years, I can say without the slightest hesitation that Diwan Krishna Murthy occupies a high place among those I hold in respect and even hold in reverence.</p>
<p>And yet, for all his dignity of bearing and seriousness of purpose, the Diwan possessed a caustic sense of humor that few people had a chance to see. I had occasion to witness it a few times, one of which I will now relate.</p>
<img src="images/0015.jpg" alt="image" />	
<div class="inlay"><p><em><strong>Diwan V.P. Madhava Rao (1850 -1934) </strong></em></p>
<p><em>A man of impossibly distinguished appearance that made the Maharaja's Private Secretary Sir Even Maconochie once joke, "No one can be as distinguished as Mr. Madhava Rao looks". His record as Diwan was brief and unremarkable.</em></p>
<p><em>But he did have a good record as administrator in other positions before he became Diwan and resigned under a cloud after a little over two years.</em></p>
<p><em>Something of Rama Rao's nemesis during the early part of his career, the two seem to have reconciled later. Many years later, one of Rama Rao's granddaughters married a great grandson of V.P. Madhava Rao.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Soon after this meeting with the Diwan, one of his aides advised me that it would be politic for me to pay a visit to V.P. Madhava Rao also. Madhava Rao was the Senior Councilor which was the second highest office in the Government. He was, in fact, to succeed Krishna Murthy as Diwan in 1906. For reasons I need not go into here, the two luminaries detested each other. So the aide's suggestion was diplomatically sound.</p>
<p>The following day I went to see Madhava Rao at his house. He was in the front yard of his house with several people in respectful attendance. Unlike the easygoing Krishna Murthy, Madhava Rao was an aloof and formal man who liked to hold court. He was also an extraordinarily handsome man of impressive build and bearing. In fact, though I am widely travelled both within India and in Europe, I cannot recall having ever seen anyone who could surpass Madhava Rao in appearance, carriage, or regality of bearing. The words used by Hamlet to describe his dead father,</p>
<p class="myquote">“.. the front of Jove himself;<br />An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;<br />A combination and a form indeed<br /> Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br />To give the world the assurance of a man”</p>
<p>might have been written to describe Madhava Rao.</p>
<p>But as often the case with men of exceptional looks, people tended to question his intellect. Sir Evan Macanochie, the Maharaja's private secretary, had once quipped, "No one can be as distinguished as Mr. Madhava Rao looks!"</p>
<p>Though intended as a joke, it was not without a grain of truth.</p>
<p>Madhava Rao knew my father, father-in-law, and several other relatives and friends of mine. He may even have been related to me. He knew about my job offer, but did not know that I had accepted it. And he interpreted what was a courtesy call on my part as a request for his advice. Without giving me a chance to break the news, he advised me to stay in private practice.</p>
<p>"I know you are an excellent lawyer," he said speaking to me cordially in Marathi. "There is no need for a man of your talents to go after a government job. You'll make far more money by staying in practice. More important, you'll also keep your independence. So, don't be in a hurry to accept the Government's offer. Discuss with your father before making your decision. After all, working for the Government as probationer – it's no big deal."</p>
<p>This put me in a quandary. There was some truth in what he was saying. It was well-intentioned, but my decision had not been based on money. Though reluctant at first, I had become convinced that government service was my duty and I was answering a call. In the idealism of youth, I had been both flattered and gratified by all the attention I was getting from people at the highest levels of the government. In addition, there was no way I could go back on my word given to a man like Diwan Krishna Murthy.</p>
<p>Finally I told Madhava Rao that I had already accepted the offer. I also pointed out that some probationers would soon be promoted to gezetted rank – meaning assistant commissioner – based on performance. So, the prospects didn’t seem all that bad. He seemed embarrassed, even a little offended. He was of a fair complexion, and his face turned crimson red.</p>
<p>"What then brings you here?" he asked me, assuming a cold and formal manner, speaking now in English.</p>
<p>"I came to see you and pay my respects," I replied.</p>
<p>"Well, you have done both," he said dismissing me. "But keep in mind what I told you.”</p>
<p>And that was the end of our conversation. I left him in none too happy a frame of mind. Soon after the meeting, the same person who had advised me to see Madhava Rao suggested that it would be wise to go and see the Diwan again.</p>
<p>"The Diwan knows you have been to see Madhava Rao," he told me.</p>
<p>This was not as sinister as it may sound, for Madhava Rao's house ‘Patan Bhavan’ was close to the Diwan's own ‘Purna Prasada’, and some member of his large household was bound to have seen me visiting Madhava Rao. Nonetheless, I found all this petty politics quite revolting.</p>
<p>Is this what they call diplomacy, I wondered. But I took his advice and went back to see the Diwan the same day.</p>
<p>"Well, well! What did the learned Councilor have to tell you?" asked the Diwan when I went to see him later that evening.</p>
<p>"Councilor Madhava Rao advised me not to join the Government. The offer of a probationer's job was nothing to be excited about. It was not such a big deal. I was better off staying in private practice – he said."</p>
<p>"Oh he did, did he?" said Krishna Murthy with a malicious laugh. "Why then did the bastard work so hard to get a probationer's job for his son?"</p>
<p>"What Madhava Rao probably meant was," I said trying to defuse his sarcasm, "persons with professional qualifications who have demonstrated competence in their field need not go into the Government just to make a living."</p>
<p>"Oh! I follow his argument now," says the Diwan. "He got his son a government job because he is a good-for-nothing fellow, and for the same reason he too went into government service."</p>
<p>The Diwan was in rare good humor when I left him. I next went to see Tait at his house and broke the news to him. He was delighted to see me back. Tait, a somewhat emotional man with a flamboyant personality, threw his arm around me and led me to his wife.</p>
<img src="images/0016.jpg" alt="image" />
<p>"Look at him!" Tait exclaimed, "Look at him well! Don't be misled by his size and humility. He is a terribly clever lad and has joined the big ones who rule us."</p>
<p>At five-foot-nine and a husky thirteen stone, I was not exactly small; neither was I known for my humility. But Tait was having some fun at my expense. Mrs. Tait regarded me with a look full of affection. Tait had been single when I first met him as a student in 1892. We used to spend a good deal of time together on long walks and other outdoor activities. Later, when he married (Anne Smith in January 1904) they were childless for several years. The two of them used to treat me like their own son.</p>
<p>“So, you have started work, haven't you?" he asked. I told him I had not yet reported for duty.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is a formality," he laughed. "Do you know what your work consists of? You go to the Diwan, salaam, and say, ‘Sahib, my promotion.’ "</p>
<p>We all laughed at this.</p>
<p>He then said, "Well, you are a Brahmin. You shouldn't have too much difficulty getting ahead in your career. Chennigappa tells me that it is hard for non-Brahmins to get ahead. May God bless you! You have brains and character. I'm sure you'll be courageous and God-fearing. I know you'll always do what you believe is right."</p>
<p>A few days after taking leave of the Taits, I went to Mysore to report for duty. For administrative purposes, the ‘Princely State’, or the hereditary kingdom of Mysore, was divided into eight districts. The chief executive of the district was, and still is, the deputy commissioner or the DC. (He was known as ‘collector’ in the British administered territories.) He was responsible for law enforcement, revenue administration, and the administration of justice, though the higher courts which came under the Department of Justice were independent of the DC. One of the eight districts was Mysore district, headquartered in Mysore city. I had been posted to Mysore to be on the staff of the DC. Though Bangalore was the administrative capital and somewhat larger, Mysore, as the ancient ceremonial capital and the seat of the Maharaja's court, enjoyed considerable prestige. So my posting to Mysore was a prized one.</p>
<p>When I reported for duty at the district office in Mysore, the first person I met was an elderly, but fairly junior official on the DC's staff. He was known in those days as Shirastedar. I cannot now recall his name. He greeted me cordially and said, "The DC is on leave for a few days. The senior assistant commissioner Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs is acting in his place. You should go and report to him."</p>
<p>Kantha Raje Urs was a member of the royal family for which reason he was known by the title of ‘Sirdar’. His elder sister was the Maharaja's mother Vani Vilas who had been regent until 1902. He was also married to the Maharaja's elder sister Princess Jayalakshmi. Such marriages among close relatives were fairly common in those days, especially among the aristocracy.</p>
<p>The acting DC was in court hearing a case. I entered the courtroom and took a seat along with the other lawyers. The Sirdar was a man in his thirties, of medium height, of dark complexion, and of slender athletic build. Having been a practicing lawyer in Salem, in British India, I was naturally curious about the procedures in the Maharaja's courts. With one exception, none of the lawyers present in the court that day was especially well-known. My initial impression was they were not as good as my former colleagues in Salem. (My friend Rajaji was of course an exceptionally able and successful lawyer who was soon to give up everything to follow Mahatma Gandhi in the Freedom Movement.) And the one lawyer in court that day who was relatively well-known was distinguished more by showmanship than ability. His name was Ramanna. He was arguing before the magistrate in a mixture of Kannada and English that can still be heard in Mysore courts. I still remember the exchange between the lawyer Ramanna and the judge. It went like this:</p>
<p class="myquote">"Has Your Honor recorded the witness’s answer?"</p>
<p class="myquote">"He says he doesn't know. So there is nothing to record."</p>
<p class="myquote">"I want what he doesn't know to be on record."</p>
<p class="myquote">The Sirdar smiled indulgently. Amused, but not forgetting the dignity of the court, he addressed the lawyer speaking as mildly as ever.</p>
<p class="myquote">"In that case don't you think we shall have a rather voluminous record? Shall we not be content with what the witness does know – that is – if it is relevant to the case?"</p>
<p class="myquote">"I don't understand Your Honor. Why does Your Honor refuse to record that the witness doesn't know what I ask him?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Ramanna! If you don't understand me, that is my misfortune. If I record only what the witness knows, I see some limit to my work. But if I rashly undertake to record everything he doesn't know I shall be struggling with infinity."</p>
<p>I could not contain myself any more and burst out laughing. This brought me to the Sirdar’s attention for the first time. He turned to me and asked, "Sir, did you come here on some business? This case will take very long. Isn't that so Mr. Ramanna? What brings you here?"</p>
<p>I stood up, saluted him with folded hands, and handed him my visiting card. On it was inscribed:</p>
<p class="myquote">Mr. Navaratna Rama Rao, B.A., B.L.<br />Vakil, Salem (crossed out)<br />Revenue Probationer, Mysore (inserted by hand)</p>
<p>B.L. stands for Bachelor of Law, the law degree, and Vakil is the Indian term for a lawyer. Kantha Raje Urs greeted me graciously.</p>
<p>"Hearty welcome!" said the Sirdar returning my salute. "Unfortunately, I am quite busy. There is little chance of Mr. Ramanna letting me off easily. Isn't that so Mr. Ramanna? (‘Yes Your Honor.’) So please go and make a report to my staff officer that you have joined duty today. And, if I may make a suggestion, you might as well go and see the DC at his home. Good afternoon!" Then turning to the lawyer, Come on Mr. Ramanna! Let us hear some more of what your protégé doesn't know."</p>
<p>This was my first meeting with Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs and the beginning of a friendship that was to end only with his untimely death some twenty years later. As advised by him, I went to see the DC at his home. But before that, I will relate another incident involving the same lawyer Ramanna that took place a couple of months later.</p>
<p>This time the judge hearing the case – one Mr. Krishna Rao – was not as even-tempered as Kantha Raje Urs, and also a good deal older. He was waging a heroic battle against time, using hair dyes, dentures, and other paraphernalia to gain assets that age had denied him. By this he was hoping to qualify for extension of service and postpone retirement. But he was a capable official.</p>
<p>Ramanna was defending a Muslim client who had been accused of assaulting someone with a shoe or some other footwear. In those days, it was considered a great insult to hit someone with any kind of footwear. He did not have much of a case, but Ramanna's arguments ranged far and wide.</p>
<p>"Your Honor! My client is a Mohammedan. Mohammedans were great rulers. Nearly a thousand years ago, Mohammed of Ghazni invaded India twelve times."</p>
<p>"Never mind Mohammed of Ghazni, Mr. Ramanna. What have we to do with all that ancient lore? Come to the point."</p>
<p>"Come to the point? Come to the point?" said Ramanna, assuming a faintly mocking tone. "If I come to the point all at once, the case will lose all its jarb and jabardast."</p>
<p>‘Jarb and jabardast’ is a phrase used to describe high style and dignity, somewhat similar to the English expression ‘pomp and pageantry’. Already irritated by Ramanna's tactics, this comment made the judge furious.</p>
<p>"Let us leave your sound and fury out of it, Mr. Ramanna," retorted the judge. "Don't waste my time. I have a great deal of work to do. Do you think you can come to the point, or shall I close the case saying you have nothing more to add?"</p>
<p>"All right Your Honor, you may close the case. It is always a failure of justice in this court."</p>
<p>This made the judge turn livid with anger. I too was shocked by the behavior and fully expected him to cite Ramanna for contempt of court; in fact, I looked forward to it. Instead, he gave the offending lawyer a sharp look and said, "Mr. Ramanna! There doesn't seem to be much difference between your mouth and the other end of your anatomy. No one expects any fragrance to come out of either."</p>
<p>Returning to my first day in office, I left the courtroom and went to see the DC at his residence. His name was C.K. Venkata Varada Iyengar, whom I will call V.V. Iyengar for short. He lived in a large house near the district office called the ‘Old Guest Quarters’. It still goes by the same name. Every senior official in those days used to have a room in his home reserved for official work. People would often come and see him even when he was off duty. I sent my card in with the orderly and waited.</p>
<p>Soon I heard a voice inviting me in. Before I could go in, I saw a man coming out in somewhat shabby clothes, with a towel thrown on his shoulder. He approached me with a shuffling gait and led me by the arm into the study. He was nearly twice my age, but extraordinarily polite, even deferential in addressing me. This was the DC, my superior officer! He was also reputed to be one of the ablest men in the Government. Having seen at first hand the officiousness and the pomposity of high officials in British India, I was unprepared for such a reception. I was totally nonplussed. It also brought to my mind a well-known Sanskrit proverb:</p>
<p>ati vinayam, dhurta lakshanam (Excessive politeness is the sign of a deceiver)</p>
<p>I felt I better be on my guard, at least until I got to know him better. He kept on addressing me as 'Sir', which added to my discomfort. After making ourselves comfortable in his study – at least he made himself comfortable – he said to me, "Will you please wait a few minutes, sir, till I complete what I am writing?" and went on with his work.</p>
<p>I studied his face. It was a refined, cultured, face but one full of self-confidence that comes with long-time exercise of high authority. I next examined the situation I was in. I felt that he must somehow have formed the idea that I was arrogant. In those days I was often described as being arrogant, and my card – lying on his table – with all my qualifications emblazoned on it did little to counter it. In addition, the brand new expensive suit and the highly fashionable boots I was wearing were in sharp contrast to his own simple attire. I made up my mind to erase any false impression he might have formed before it could take firm root.</p>
<p>My suspicion seemed to be confirmed when V.V. Iyengar handed me the document he had been working on and said, "Sir, would you please go over this and make any corrections you think necessary?"</p>
<p>I looked over the document. It was an official draft in English addressed to the Government. Even though English is not our language, as with any language, we must respect the rules of grammar and usage when we employ it. The document he handed to me could have used some corrections, but I felt it was not the wise thing to do. I pointed out to him that as a probationer, my job was to study and learn, not criticize.</p>
<p>"I am a rank beginner at this," I told him in the humblest manner I could summon. "The Government has sent me to this prestigious office to study under you and learn. It would be presumptuous on my part to start correcting what you have written. I have neither the qualifications nor the experience."</p>
<p>I felt quite pleased with my humble act.</p>
<p>"How humble you are sir!" he exclaimed. "A multiple graduate – B.A. and B.L., and the Civil Service Examination – and yet you are so modest. Look at him, Mr. Srinivasa Murthy," he said pointing to a clerk seated nearby, "he has failed his M.A. exams repeatedly, and yet he crosses out just about everything I write."</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Srinivasa Murthy managed a baleful laugh as if he had just swallowed a large dose of castor oil. I began to see that V.V. Iyengar had an unusual sense of humor and his deferential manner was largely a pose – his own way of laughing at pompous officials who take themselves too seriously. The latter is a species of which there is never a shortage.</p>
<p>He then handed me the records of a case concerning a land revenue dispute and asked me to report back to him in a week. Thus ended my first day in office.</p>
<p>For the next year or so, until V.V. Iyengar was promoted chief secretary and posted to Bangalore, I worked closely with him. My main function was to serve as the DC's private secretary and staff officer. I would study all revenue-related cases that came to his office and report my findings to him. Occasionally, he would hand me a case of particular importance for detailed study. I would then look over it carefully, prepare a summary highlighting the salient points, and, if necessary, personally discuss the case with him. Also, as I was a lawyer and he was not, he would bring cases to my attention for legal opinion. I would then submit my opinion together with a summary of my arguments. He soon came to like me and depended heavily on my advice. He fully trusted my judgment in matters of law and revenue. My respect and affection for him also grew.</p>
<p>All this experience was very valuable to me, for V.V. Iyengar was a very able official with an exceptional grasp of detail. It is fair to say that I acquired most of my knowledge of the workings of our Government during the year or so I was with V.V. Iyengar. I served in the Government for thirty years, but the foundation was laid during that one year in Mysore. His personality was unusual, to say the least – for V.V. Iyengar was a true eccentric. But as often is the case with such people, it was hard to tell how much of it was real and how much just cultivated showmanship. He had a rare talent for introducing a humorous twist to ticklish situations, which sometimes helped resolve problems. I will next relate a story about him that will give an idea of what I mean.</p>
<p>The Government needed to acquire some private land for a public works project like a road or some such thing. The owner happened to be a Muslim gentleman whose name I cannot now recall. The Government’s offer was fair, but the owner wanted more. Seeing that the subordinates were making little progress, the DC, V.V. Iyengar himself, came to the meeting to persuade the owner. If I remember right, the Government was prepared to pay two hundred rupees an acre, but the owner wanted five hundred.</p>
<p>“We have records of all the recent sales in your area,” said the DC. “There is nothing over Rs. 150. The Government is prepared to pay you Rs. 200. Why don’t you accept it?”</p>
<p>“No sir!” said the owner. “It is a sacrifice at Rs 500. I never tell a lie. If I am lying, sentence me, send me to prison”, he persisted.</p>
<p>This went on all day. “Mai jhoot nai bolta hun. Jhoot bolya to jail ko bhejo, saja de dalo” was his only response. (“I never tell a lie. If I am lying, give me a sentence, send me to jail.”) We broke for lunch and came back. The owner kept on repeating his mantra: “Jail ko bhejo, saja de dalo.”</p>
<p>V.V. Iyengar was a man of commendable patience. As the day wore on without any resolution, he rose with a sigh, and addressed his antagonist in a stern yet kindly voice.</p>
<p>“Don’t say such terrible things Sahib,” entreated the DC. “You seem to be under the impression that prisons and sentences are highly sought luxuries. If so, I can’t hand them to you free. It takes some effort on your part to earn them. Look, if you are so keen on it, grab something from this table and make a run for it. Then I shall be happy to award you a prison sentence. You can enjoy the luxury for at least ten or fifteen days.”</p>
<p>With these words he closed the case for the evening. By the next morning, the owner was ready to accept the Government’s terms.</p>
<p>V.V Iyengar was reputed to be an honest official. He was certainly honest, but sometimes took his honesty to absurd limits. Once, during a visit to a village in his district, a wealthy farmer who had just acquired a pair of beautiful thoroughbred oxen came to see V.V. Iyengar. As a mark of respect, or purely out of vanity, the farmer offered to take the DC to the next village on his circuit in his cart, drawn by the new pair of oxen of which he was so proud. The DC accepted. Upon reaching their destination, V.V. Iyengar tried to pay the farmer ten annas at two annas per mile – the then prevailing rate. The farmer refused. He pointed out to the DC that with his hospitality he was only showing his respect for the Maharaja whose representative the DC was at the district level. But this DC never accepted anything free. He rented a cart to take him back to the original village, and then rented another cart to take him to his destination a second time. Only then was his conscience satisfied.</p>
<p>This incident was said to have taken place sometime before I joined him. So I can’t vouch for it. But it is entirely consistent with his personality as I knew it. It reminds me of a similar story about a famous country doctor known as ‘the Pandit’ who was of my father's generation. He was a master at combining medical science with astrology and magical chants. This man had descended from a long line of doctors of his own kind who had acquired great wealth and fame by concocting remedies for every ailment known to man.</p>
<p>Once, when treating a particularly virulent case of typhoid fever, the Pandit decided to use his master creation, a monument to his invention, a tablet called by him the ‘the mighty destroyer’ or ‘Maha Bahirava Matra’ – his detractors claimed it was just salt and sugar mixed in equal proportion. Anyway, the Pandit instructed one of his assistants to prepare a potion by grinding this tablet in cow's urine, executing exactly five revolutions clockwise. But his assistant was absent-minded. When asked by his master, the fellow admitted that by mistake he had executed seven revolutions clockwise. Undeterred, the great man said, "You jackass! Just grind it backwards for two revolutions."</p>
<p>And the problem was solved by two additional revolutions counterclockwise.</p>
<p>V.V. Iyengar would have appreciated the logic of it!</p>
<p><strong>Appendix: More than just an eccentric </strong></p>
<p>The account given so far does not do full justice to V.V. Iyengar, for he was a remarkable man with a strong sense of social justice. Chakravarti Venkata Varada Iyengar, to give his full name was a non-conformist with a reformist bent of mind. We don’t know when exactly he was born but since he retired in 1907 when he would have been 55, the retirement age those days, we may assume he was born around 1852. This tallies with Rama Rao’s statement he was nearly ‘twice my age’ in 1904 when Rama Rao was about 27. He was born into an orthodox Srivaishnava (Iyengar) Brahmin family but became a staunch follower of the reformist Hindu sect and movement Arya Samaj and its leader Swami Shraddhanada. As part of this he married Krishna Bai, a young widow from outside his caste. After her marriage to Iyengar, Krishnamma, as she came to be known, actively participated in her husband’s philanthropic works.</p>

			<figcaption><em>Venkata Varada Iyengar and Krishnamma who devoted their lives to uplift of destitute women</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Krishnamma came from a wealthy family in Penukonda (in the Madras Presidency in British India) but was married and widowed</p>
<p>Venkata Varada Iyengar and Krishnamma who devoted their lives to uplift of destitute women young. She had no intention of being confined to the life that was a Brahmin widow’s lot in those days. She was encouraged by one Mrs. Pitt (first name unknown) the widow of Isaac Pitt who had been collector (deputy commissioner) of Penukonda to pursue her own life and interests regardless of her widowhood. Through friends of common interest she became acquainted with V.V. Iyengar, then just out of Maharaja’s College in Mysore and married him.</p>
<p>Krishnamma was not interested in just finding a husband, she wanted to do something for others in the same plight. Mrs. Pitt advised her that the best thing for her to do was to found a home for destitute women. Her husband was also thinking along similar lines. Being a man of strong convictions who practiced what he preached, he founded an informal institution called ‘Abalashrama’ (meaning refuge for powerless women in Sanskrit and Kannada). In the beginning he used his own home to house young women and teach them practical skills. They were comparatively well off but the expenses of caring for so many people taxed their resources to the limit. Kamalamma sold off a good deal of her inheritance including jewelry to finance their activities. Mrs. Pitt who was then living in Cambridge occasionally visited them and made small donations. (She was not a wealthy woman.)</p>
<p>Their activities began in 1907 soon after Iyengar retired from service. For several years they supported it with their own resources supplemented by donations from friends, but their work soon attracted wide attention and began to receive substantial donations. What is remarkable from contemporary reports is the strong sense of reform and charity that prevailed among the elite. At first the couple faced ostracism for their unconventional marriage, but their charitable work changed it to admiration and respect. In 1911 they received funds from the government for a dedicated building. It was inaugurated by Iyengar himself at public request.</p>
<p>The Abalashrama is today a flourishing institution but it was made possible by the vision, courage and the selfless dedication of a noble couple more than a hundred years ago.</p>
