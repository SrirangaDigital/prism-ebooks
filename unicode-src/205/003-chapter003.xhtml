		<p><strong><em>Meeting the Maharaja. An unusual method of silencing a trouble-maker. Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs. Royal personages – real and fake. British officers and the secret of their hunting exploits. A resourceful tribal chief. </em></strong></p>
		<p>While still working as probationer in Mysore, I had occasion to participate in a couple of interesting episodes that will give an idea of the social conditions at the time under the Maharaja’s rule. The first of these was a special duty assignment in which I was placed in charge of arrangements to receive the Maharaja during his visit to a small town called Megalapur. The second, and to me more interesting, was meeting with a British regimental party and an opportunity to witness their hunting methods. I will relate these two incidents here.</p>
		<p>Within a few months of my coming to Mysore, His Highness Maharaja Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV made a circuit trip from his royal seat in Mysore to the nearby town of Narsipur. It was the practice of our rulers those days to make such trips to meet with their subjects personally. To our people, such visits by the Maharaja were occasions for rejoicing and celebration. Men and women would line the streets and bring their children to be blessed by their beloved ruler; Brahmin priests would hold services and anoint the king; and one and all would use the occasion to show their affection and devotion to their ancient ruling family.</p>
		<p>The deputy commissioner (DC) had charged me with the responsibility of supervising the route from the village of Megalapur to the small town of Varuna. This meant organizing a reception party at Megalapur by setting up porches and arches stocked with flowers and bouquets, and having the village notables present to receive the royal party. The work was not in the least demanding; the people loved such occasions and generously volunteered both their time and labor. All I had to do was to go to the appointed place and set up camp a day or so prior to the royal visit. This should have been the case, but on this particular occasion, events took an unexpected turn.</p>
		<p>On the day prior to the royal visit, I received news that a character by name Basava Rajappa was bent on mischief. He claimed either he or some party that he represented had lost title to some valuable lands in Megalapur due to the high-handed action of the local revenue and law enforcement official known as the ‘Amildar’. And this action had been upheld by the DC's office despite vigorous protests, because the Amildar in question was in high standing with his superior— or so Basava Rajappa claimed. He was now threatening to disrupt the reception by taking his appeal directly to the Maharaja when he stopped at the village.</p>
		<p>The threat, if carried out, would be seen as a major embarrassment to the village; even a disgrace. I knew of Basava Rajappa. He was a pleader or paralegal assistant in Mysore where he had built up quite a reputation as a trouble-maker and publicity-seeker; and I knew him to be fully capable of carrying out his threat. I knew also that he was already in Megalapur. So I briefed the Amildar, the Patel, and other officials about the situation. They were horrified. Everyone seemed to be at a loss. The Patel finally asked me what was to be done about the threat.</p>
		<p>"In that case," I asked them, "are you prepared to do as I tell you if I promise to save your town from disgrace?"</p>
		<p>They promised their full co-operation. I then decided to take some drastic measures.</p>
		<p>The next day – the day of the royal visit – I came down to Megalapur before dawn and inspected an old ruined temple situated a few hundred yards from the reception area. It had long been out of use, but was still structurally sound with heavy solid doors. I then went back and met with the Patel.</p>
		<p>"Have four or five strong men – preferably wrestlers – ready at the reception," I told him. "Then, as soon as I give this signal, tell them to seize Basava Rajappa, and forcibly carry him into that temple. They are to keep him there locked until the royal party is safely out of town. If there is any noise, we shall tell His Highness that it is the village lunatic who had to be kept confined for fear he might go berserk."</p>
		<p>The Patel left immediately to find the necessary men. I next went and stationed a trumpeter at an eminence, just outside the village, from where he could see down the road for more than a mile. I left instructions with him to alert us with a trumpet blast as soon as he spotted the royal party. I then went over to the reception area and waited nervously for the trumpeter’s signal.</p>
		<p>In the reception area, we had erected a porch and laid several tables stocked with fruits, flowers, and other paraphernalia used by Brahmin priests in those days for receiving the king. I had also stationed a band of musicians who I thought might help drown out any noises that might be coming from the direction of the temple. Basava Rajappa was also present. I felt a twinge of guilt upon seeing his diminutive figure, standing there, blissfully unaware of the fate I had in store for him. Once again I tried to reason with the man.</p>
		<p>"Sir, this is a joyful occasion for these people," I told him. "Why don't you just give up your idea? What do you hope to get out of ruining an occasion, which means so much to everyone? Your case belongs in court. I am an official in the DC's office. Bring your case to me. If it has merit I'll personally bring it to the DC's attention. That's where your case belongs."</p>
		<p>But Basava Rajappa was not to be budged from his stand. The more we tried reasoning with him, the more insolent his attitude became. It was soon clear that he was more interested in gaining some notoriety than in seeing justice done. It made me feel he fully deserved what he was about to get.</p>
		<p>Before long we heard the pre-arranged signal from the trumpeter. This meant the royal party would be arriving in about a quarter of an hour. I gave the signal to the Patel, and he gave the go ahead to his men. Four powerfully-built men came forward, grabbed Basava Rajappa, and carried him kicking and screaming in the direction of the temple. His wails tailed away and within a few minutes he could no longer be heard. The Patel must have informed the villagers what to expect; no one acted surprised. Some just laughed, while others took it quietly; but no one said a word in his defense. I also gave instructions to the musicians to start playing the royal anthem. I was taking no chances.</p>

		<p>Soon the Maharaja arrived accompanied by a small contingent of cavalry. With him in his carriage was his uncle and brother-in-law, Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs, the acting DC. I had not seen the Maharaja in several years, and it also was my first official meeting with him. Maharaja Krishna Raja IV was a good-looking young man of about twenty-one, of dark complexion, just below medium height, and of fine athletic build. He was attentive, soft- spoken with a somewhat high-pitched voice, and, for one so young, remarkably serious. His Highness addressed me in English, which he spoke with the accents of a cultivated Englishman – the result of years of English tutoring. <strong>[Sic: </strong>Rama Rao being Tait’s protégé spoke English with a Scottish accent. Neither of them was probably conscious of this incongruous scene being enacted by two young Indians deep in the heart of India! <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
		<p>After making some gracious inquiries about my family, he asked me the usual questions like – ‘What is the population of the village? How many dwellings did it have and how the economy was doing?’ And so forth. I hardly remember what I said. All the while, my mind was preoccupied with the dreadful prospect of an ungodly wail being let loose from the temple. The Maharaja was at the reception for no more than half an hour. It seemed like an eternity to me.</p>
		<p>"We are pleased," said the Maharaja finally with a smile.</p>
		<p>Kantha Raje Urs also looked pleased and thanked me and everyone else present. The party was soon on its way to Varuna and I breathed a deep sigh of relief. Upon returning to Mysore, I myself told Kantha Raje Urs what had actually transpired. The Sirdar was highly amused.</p>
		<p>Before getting to the next episode – about the British hunting party – I would like to relate a few things about my late senior friend Kantha Raje Urs. He was, as our mutual friend Dasappa of Belavadi once said, truly a man fit to be king.</p>
		<p>My senior friend, the late Dasappa of Belavadi, was a true eccentric and it was no pose. But few saw beyond his superficial eccentricities. He was a profound scholar of literature in several languages and also of Indian philosophy. In many ways he was my guru. He was a schoolmaster of genius – in an age when schoolmasters were greatly respected. He often visited us in our house in Mysore. He would come invariably dressed in spectacular riding clothes with a sword dangling from his waist, followed by a servant who carried a chair for him to sit on! I once caught him cutting a piece out of an old leather back chair I had, for he thought he could fashion a good shield out of it!</p>
		<p>When something struck his fancy, Dasappa would become totally immersed in it to the exclusion of everything else. He was, as I noted, a profound scholar of Indian philosophy and a student of medieval Indian history, which he tried to act out. Once he became so absorbed with horsemanship that he used to go around in the most outlandish costumes fashioned after Rajput warriors of medieval India. He had absolutely no inhibitions.</p>

			<p class="myquote"><strong><em>Sir Mysore Kantha Raje Urs (1870 - 1923) </em></strong></p>
			<p class="myquote">Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs (Not Kantharaj Urs) was Navaratna Rama Rao's senior officer and family friend. An enthusiastic admirer of Rama Rao, his support in 1912 was important in Rama Rao's success in establishing the Mysore Sericulture (Silk) Department making Mysore (and Karnataka later) the largest silk producer in India and the State's largest private employer.</p>
			<p class="myquote">He was married to the Maharaja's sister Jayalakshammanni for whom the Jayalakshmi Mansion in Mysore, now part of the University Museum was built.</p>
			<p class="myquote">A man of great generosity and kindness, many said he was a "Man fit to be king". "A few disagreed saying he lacked the toughness needed in a ruler.</p>
		</div>
		<p>"I say Mr. Rama Rao," Kantha Raje Urs once asked me "your friend – Mr. Dasappa – is he quite sane?"</p>
		<p>"Not only is he sane sir," I replied hotly, "he is a genius!"</p>
		<p>This made the Sirdar laugh.</p>
		<p>"I saw him at the polo grounds the other day," said the Sirdar. "He was dressed in a wonderful turban and antiquated military dress – with a sword strapped around him. His genius had assumed that form."</p>
		<p>The Sirdar was himself a man of infinite patience. I don't think I can remember every occasion when I had managed to offend him, but I'll recount just one here, to give an idea of his tolerance and kindness.</p>
		<img src="images/0020.jpg" alt="image" />
		<div class="inlay">
		<p><strong>Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion, built in 1905 : </strong>It was built by the Maharaja for his eldest sister Jayalakshmi who was married to Sridar Kanthe Rage Urs. The 135-room mansion was their residence until their daughter Princess Leelavati sold it to Mysore University in the 1950s. It is now part of the University Museum.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Soon after joining the Maharaja's Government, I was appointed a ‘third class’ magistrate in the court in Mysore. This meant that relatively minor cases – mostly civil disputes – were heard before me. It was of course an honor, and I presided over the proceedings with great dignity – or so I fondly thought. But being very young, it is quite possible I was just overbearing. In any event, one of the cases that came into my court involved one Panduranga Shetty – a local politician of some standing – who was thought to have many influential friends; at least that was the impression he gave. A neighbor of his – an elderly widow – had charged him with trespassing on her property and carrying off some building materials (stone slabs) that she had bought to renovate her bathroom. Her complaint had been filed in my court.</p>
		<p>The evidence was overwhelming; Panduranga Shetty had no case. But he was the sort of man who believed that his political influence was sufficient for him to bend the law to suit his own ends. He knew his way about the courts and would bring a different lawyer to each hearing. His arrogance seemed to know no bounds. He treated my court with utter disdain; it was after all just a 'third class' magistrate's court. After hearing the case, I told him I would announce my judgment the following day, and asked him to be present at eleven. He said he had to be at the first class magistrate's court at that time. I told him to come at three. He said he had to be present at an appeal in the district court at that time and could only come at four. I agreed.</p>
		<p>He showed up the next day at four while I was in the middle of a briefing.</p>
		<p>"Sir, is the judgment ready?" he asked impatiently.</p>
		<p>I told him to wait for a few minutes so I could finish what I was doing.</p>
		<p>"Sir, I have to go back to court," he said ostentatiously looking at his watch out of his waist pocket.</p>
		<p>"You seem to be in a great hurry."</p>
		<p>"I am always in a great hurry," said Panduranga Shetty, pulling himself up to his full height. "This isn't the only thing I have on hand. I have to be in another court. You must understand that I am a very busy man."</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't worry," I told him. "You won't be busy for a while. I suggest you send someone else to all those courts to represent you. I have arranged for fifteen days of rest and relaxation for you."</p>
		<p>I then read my judgment sentencing him to fifteen days in prison.</p>
		<p>All hell broke loose. The local newspaper wrote about it, and wherever I went, people would point to me as the one who had sentenced Panduranga Shetty to prison. Naturally there was an appeal in the district court, where the presiding magistrate was none other than Kantha Raje Urs. The defendant was represented by the well-known lawyer M.C. Ranga Iyengar, who, I later learnt, denounced my judgment as high-handed arrogance while portraying Panduranga Shetty as a simple soul and a victim of my wrath. The day after the hearing, I ran into Kantha Raje Urs who was on his way to the polo grounds. The arguments in the case must have been going through his mind.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Mr. Rama Rao!” he addressed me with a smile. “You seem inclined to a wholesome severity."</p>
		<p>Then still in my twenties I was both hot-headed and hot-blooded.</p>
		<p>"You are referring to Panduranga Shetty's case, I believe, sir," I replied somewhat impulsively. "He seemed to deserve what I gave him. His appeal is before you. If you think him an ill-used worthy man, my mistake is easily remedied."</p>
		<p>The Sirdar said nothing; he just shrugged his shoulders as he left me. I knew immediately that my reaction had been rash and even rude, and felt bad about it. But in the immaturity of youth I was too proud to admit it, and avoided him for the next several days. A few days later, when I had to be at the district office on some business, Kantha Raje Urs saw me and sent for me to see him in his office. He brought up the case of Panduranga Shetty.</p>
		<p>"I am afraid poor Panduranga Shetty did not seem such a saint to me either," said the Sirdar with a smile. "I dismissed his appeal."</p>
		<p>I was moved by his gentleness.</p>
		<p>"Sir, I am sorry for the fellow," I said. "But I am grateful to you for giving me this opportunity for expressing my regret for a very foolish thing I said to you."</p>
		<p>"Oh! I too have been young," was his response.</p>
		<p>He shook me by the hand and walked with me down to the courtyard where I had left my horse.</p>
		<p>This simple episode gives a glimpse into the nobility of Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs's character. Even though he was a prince of royal blood, he always saw the best in others and never demanded anything. It was my good fortune that he was not only my superior officer, but also a good friend. Many years later, when I was struggling to establish our silk industry on a sound footing, it was Kantha Raje Urs who supported me against almost universal opposition and even ridicule. My own contributions to it have been recognized but Kantha Raje Urs is a forgotten man today. I feel it my responsibility to preserve for posterity the names and accomplishments of those like the Sirdar.</p>
		<p>Now to the hunting story. The DC sent me on special duty to Gundalpet, about forty miles south of Mysore. Two regiments of the Indian army, stationed in Bangalore, would be camping in the forests of Bandipur on their way to the Nilgiri Mountains for Christmas holidays. That part of the country – i.e., Bandipur which is in Gundalpet taluk – was all wilderness, and included what is now the famous Bandipur wild life sanctuary. I had been assigned to assist the local Amildar – the chief of Gundalpet taluk – in making arrangements for the two regiments. In reality, it meant ensuring that the British officers of the regiment were looked after in that wild place. I travelled to Gundalpet a couple of days prior to the scheduled visit and saw the Amildar.</p>
		<p>The Amildar of Gundalpet was unhappy that the DC had sent me to supervise arrangements in an area that was under his charge. And he made no effort to hide his displeasure. He was a hide-bound official of the old school, always trying to impress people with some real or imagined connection with the durbar in Mysore. He was also fond of affecting the mannerisms of the durbar. His taluk was mostly wilderness with hardly any villages, which allowed him the time to indulge in these antics.</p>
		<p>He was holding forth in one of his durbars when I went to report to him. Several of his subordinates and a few timber contractors and other local merchants were in attendance, listening to his royal anecdotes with respectful attention. They had little choice. I sent in my card and waited for a response. None came. So I barged in.</p>
		<p>"Oho! Come in, do come in!" he said as he greeted me with exaggerated courtesy. Perhaps it was his royal connection. Then turning to the assembly he announced:</p>
		<p>"He is a probationer from Mysore. The DC has sent him here so I can train him in special duty."</p>
		<p>"What are your instructions?" I asked him, ignoring his last remark. "I am ready to leave for Bandipur immediately. Who are the people you have deputed to assist me?"</p>
		<p>"Sit down. What is the hurry?"</p>
		<p>Then turning to the assembly again, "As I was just saying," he continued, "when I am in Mysore – there is no telling when there will be a bulao from the palace. Any time of the day or night, a messenger can come dashing in and say, 'My lord! You are commanded to be at the palace today.' I have no choice but to go. At a palace dinner, the atmosphere is so tense – you can't speak or cough – or even blow your nose! This goes on even after dinner. We can relax only after His Highness has retired for the night. It is no fun being close to royalty."</p>
		<p>After several minutes of this he turned to me and said, "You may take the cart and go to Bandipur tonight. I am sending the police inspector, the Khan Saheb, with you. He is a very experienced man and knows what all needs to be done. I have also left instructions with the supply officer and the forest ranger to take care of supplies and living arrangements. You can rest assured that everything has been taken care of. There is nothing for you to do. Your presence here is a formality. The only thing for you to do is – when you go back to Mysore – remember to write a beautiful report in that beautiful English of yours to the DC who sent you here."</p>
		<p>I found his whole attitude infuriating, but there was nothing I could do. I then went to meet the inspector, a Muslim gentleman whose name I cannot now recall. He too was of royal blood apparently, related to the now defunct ruling house of Arcot. He told me so himself. After all these years, the exact nature of their relationship is still something of a mystery to me, but it seemed to go something like this – his grandfather's uncle's aunt's nephew's second cousin's third step-sonin-law was the son of Nawab Mohamed Ali's second concubine; or it might have been the other way around. After this many years I cannot vouch for all the details of this conundrum. His style, bearing, and manners, certainly bespoke this high birth. I had had my fill of royalty for the day; but I was also determined to get along with the man and make my stay as pleasant as possible. This proved easy; for all his affectation I found him to be a most agreeable man. I felt the best course was to appeal to his vanity.</p>
		<p>"Mohammed Jafar Khan, the Mysore Chief of Police, is a good friend of mine," I said to him as I shook him by the hand. This was perfectly true. "He mentioned you by name and advised me specifically to cultivate your friendship."</p>
		<p>The last statement was a lie – but a diplomatic lie – necessary in the circumstances. After all, I had to share camp with him for several days. It was obviously the right approach, for he seemed quite pleased.</p>
		<p>"I am very happy to meet you sir," he replied. "I always stay with Mohammed Jafar Saheb whenever I am in Mysore. He is also a relative of mine – a distant relative."</p>
		<p>Not so close as the Nawab of Arcot, apparently.</p>
		<p>"I know you by reputation," he continued. "I have heard Jafar Saheb speak of you as a very able and courageous magistrate."</p>
		<p>We became good friends. He was a vain man, indolent, with a high opinion of himself, who always insisted on having his own way in everything. In spite of this, my three or four days in his company were delightful. We both stayed at the police outpost in Bandipur. There were a couple policemen with us, and the inspector, though a lazy man himself, made sure they were never idle for a moment. The first thing in the morning, he would shout to Kasim to bring him his hookah. After observing this fire-worshipping ritual for half an hour, he would yell at his other policeman to get his breakfast ready.</p>
		<p>"Hey Ninga!" he would shout, "Is the milk ready for tea? What, no milk? You idiot, go get some. What about eggs? You expect me to eat grass? Even my horse won't eat it."</p>
		<p>"What? Patel," he would complain to the village chief, "can't you get us a sheep for dinner? No? What a rotten place. Get us at least some chicken. We came here on Government work – and you are starving us!"</p>
		<p>And so on, until he retired for the night.</p>
		<p>Then, on the eve of the day on which the regiments were due to arrive, a couple of native Indian officers came by to review the arrangements. One of them was Subedar Major Sholapuri – a highly-decorated soldier and renowned marksman. He was a peerless rifle shot who had won prizes at national and international meets. I had read about his exploits in the newspapers and was delighted to have the opportunity of meeting him. I was myself a keen sportsman, and had brought with me a rifle and my revolver on the trip. It did not take us long to become friends. He was flattered that there was someone even in that God-forsaken part of the world who had heard of him. I wished to show him my own weapons and display my skill, hoping to bask in the reflected glory of this great sportsman.</p>
		<img src="images/0021.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>He was soon followed by a couple of English officers who looked no older than college boys, but were nominally his superiors. This was in 1904 – the heyday of the Raj – and British officers often outranked Indians of greater experience, even when they did not have much responsibility in the field. (The situation was somewhat like in some oil sheikdoms where natives are appointed ‘managers’ with experienced foreigners hired to assist them.) Their commanding officer – one Colonel Stevens – had known about me through Tait, and treated me with a good deal of respect. Their respect seemed to increase when they learnt that even in their own field – military history – I was well read in topics like the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War, the Sudan Campaign, and the like, and had also written about them. Tait had told him about these articles and might even have shown a few of them. We soon became friends.</p>
		<p>The two youngsters wanted to have some shikar in the one day they were camping in Bandipur. Conditions were not favorable for tracking any kind of game. The head tracker, the chief of the hill tribe, told them, "This is winter. The ground is covered with dry leaves. It is impossible to move about without making noise. We are bound to scare away game. But I'll see if I can get you at least some jungle fowl."</p>
		<p>I could not believe my ears. The Indian jungle fowl is a very wary creature, not easy to approach even under the most favorable conditions. I was by then a fairly experienced sportsman, yet I was unable to fathom how these novices hoped to get close enough for a shot. I could only assume that these tribesmen who spent their whole lives in the jungle must know what they were talking about.</p>
		<p>Apparently their hunting expedition had been crowned with success. That evening, the two officers came to Stevens and me in the camp, and showed off their bag of some half a dozen or so hens and roosters. They were elated.</p>
		<p>"We did have some sport after all, sir," one of them told us. "Fallen leaves made tracking tricky – but we did get some jungle fowl. They are said to be rather good eating. Only a bit tough unless kept overnight."</p>
		<p>I congratulated them, but mentally shook my head in disbelief. Even if the tribesmen were expert trackers who could move about without alarming game, I couldn't understand how these two inexperienced English boys could have kept up with the trackers. After all, game doesn’t distinguish between trackers and hunters; one clumsy footstep is all it takes to alarm them.</p>
		<p>Then the following day, after the party had left for the Nilgiris, the mystery was explained to me. The visiting officers had promised the chief of the hill tribe a large reward and a certificate if he could take them close to where there was some game. At first he explained to them the difficulty with the conditions, but later promised to try. He was a resourceful man. He took some poultry chickens from the camp kitchen and released them in a bamboo clump not far from camp; he later led the two youngsters to the spot. About half a dozen were shot, and he retrieved the rest later, returning them to the camp cook.</p>

		<p>When he reported this to me, he commented that the boys were rather poor shots, and should have done better at close range – shooting domestic fowl, which cannot fly. Jungle fowl do fly; that is the only difference. They both look alike, but domestic fowl is tastier eating by far.</p>
		<p>Shortly after returning to Mysore from this special duty, I received notice that I had been promoted and appointed Amildar of Yedatore taluk, still in the Mysore district.</p>
