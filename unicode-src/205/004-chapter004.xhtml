		<p><strong><em>The Amildar was the key official in the princely state of Mysore. To our people in those days, the Government meant the Amildar. I had some experience as acting Amildar during my one year as probationer in Mysore. What I will do in this chapter is briefly give an idea of what an Amildar was like in those days. I had of course known Amildars from childhood. </em></strong></p>
		<p>A few decades earlier, the taluk chief, or the Amildar, then called ‘Subedar’, had military duties also; the deputy commissioner (DC) was known as ‘Fauzdar’. When I became Amildar, there was still a good deal of the authority and respect that old time Subedars used to command. At temples and other religious institutions, the Amildar was accorded royal respect as the official representative of the Maharaja. Some of my ancestors had in earlier times, exercised that authority. As small children we used to hear stories about their exploits . <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-004-01">1 </a></sup>The Subedars of those days might not have been educated in the modern sense; some were not particularly proficient in matters relating to law and official procedures. But their commitment, courage, and sense of duty have left an enduring stamp on my mind.</p>
		<p>As a child, I had seen only a couple of Amildars from that heroic age . <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-004-02">2</a></sup>I was a child, and they were very old. The great reverence in which they held by my elders had created a halo around them, which makes my memory of them somewhat indistinct. Occasionally, I still see one of them in my dreams. I used to sit in his lap and hear the story of the Mahabharata from him. It made me think that ancient heroes Bhishma and Drona must have been like him. His elderly wife was still alive. She would not allow anyone else to serve her husband. Although they lived as heads of a joint family of some fifty members, consisting of children, grandchildren, and others, she alone would attend to his needs like serving water for his daily prayer, ghee for his meals, adjusting his shawl, and other such chores.</p>
		<p>One extraordinary event relating to the head of the family that took place in that noble house is still fresh in my memory. His sons were employed in responsible positions all over the country. The head of the family had them all brought to the house on a particular day. He asked the family priest and close friends also to be present for the occasion. Facing this assembly, the old man stood up, saluted them with folded hands, and addressed them in a voice choked with emotion. “For years, you have treated me as an honorable man, an honest man, and a man of character,” he began. “But I am utterly unworthy of this. I am a sinner. I can no longer go on wearing this mask of deceit.”</p>
		<p>Tears flowed down his cheeks as he completed his speech. Everyone was speechless. His wife, who was sitting by his feet, burst into tears and began to sob uncontrollably.</p>
		<p>“My lord and my life,” she appealed in between sobs, “Please don’t cry. Where can we find a better man or one more just. Why are you blaming yourself for nothing? Don’t I know what you are like?”</p>
		<p>Some of the people present hailed him as ‘Rajarshi’ (royal sage) and with other ancient praises. He ignored all that and addressed his wife.</p>
		<p>“You do not know,” he said speaking directly to his wife, “and this is what is tearing me. You have always believed that I was a faithful husband and an honest man. You almost worship me taking me to be a blameless man. But I have been unfaithful to you. My prosperity is because of your character, not my goodness. God has rewarded this household because of you. Please, everyone present hear what sort of man I have been.”</p>
		<p>He narrated how many years ago, as a youth, he had had an affair with a young Muslim woman living in the neighborhood. He had, therefore, been unfaithful to his wife.</p>
		<p>“The woman was not married,” he said, “so I did no harm to her husband. The woman, she herself sought me out and I helped her in many ways, so I did her no injustice. Soon she left me and went away somewhere. The only person to suffer injustice was my faithful wife – the mother of my children and the Goddess of this household. After committing this sin, all these years I have lived a life of falsehood, pretending to be an honorable man. I beseech my wife’s forgiveness with all of you as witnesses.”</p>
		<p>As soon as she heard the word ‘forgiveness’, his wife recoiled in horror and said, “How can you ask me, your wife, for forgiveness? Will God approve of it?”</p>
		<p>“Many men are guilty of such lapses in their youth,” the family priest intoned.</p>
		<p>The worthy Brahmin seemed to have stumbled a few times in his life.</p>
		<p>“Repentance is the best redemption,” continued the priest. “Invite a few elderly Brahmins and feed them after a proper ceremony.”</p>
		<p>“But what about sinning against my wife?” the old man persisted. “Pretending to be honest all these years – living a life of falsehood?”</p>
		<p>His wife now began to laugh through her tears.</p>
		<p>“This is what is so childlike about this man,” she said. “He knows nothing. You thought I knew nothing, but I knew it all along. I was the one who drove that bitch out of town – hitting her with a broom and threatening her with more if she didn’t leave town.”</p>
		<p>The assembly dispersed, leaving only a few behind.</p>
		<p>“How kind of you,” the old man said later to his wife, “that you loved me knowing that I am a sinner.”</p>
		<p>“A husband like you, like God, is without sin,” she replied. “My husband to me is like the river Ganges. I am holy because he is holy.”</p>
		<p>It used to make me laugh whenever I thought of this episode when I was young. But later, as I get older, it embodies for me a profound truth about our country and our culture. It highlights the generosity, forgiveness, and virtue of our mothers, of our women – with qualities like Mother Earth herself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-004-03">3 </a></sup>These are the true daughters of Mother India. It is they who have preserved our culture, traditions, and our civilization. This is my firm belief.</p>
		<p>He died shortly after this episode. Someone asked his wife if she did not wish to die before him to avoid the life of a widow.</p>
		<p>“Not in the least,” she replied. “My husband always came before me in everything. I always took care of his needs – be it food, sleep or anything. Had I died before him, who would take care of him? Now my duty is done, I am ready to go.”</p>
		<p>Now that I was appointed Amildar, men such as these were my heroes. I recall my first experience when I took charge of Attikuppe (Krishnarajpet) as Amildar for a period of fifteen days. I was to be acting in the place of Krishnaji Naryana Rao who was going on leave for two weeks. I had just completed my riding course and went to the office to take charge. I was wearing a fashionably cut new suit and riding boots. It was something new to the place, and a crowd had gathered to see me. Krishnaji Naryana Rao, an elderly man, came out and met me.</p>
		<p>“Good morning!” he said in English, as he shook me by the hand.</p>
		<p>“Good morning!” I replied. “I am glad to meet you.”</p>
		<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>
		<p>“I am not in any hurry to assume charge,” I told him in English as he kept on signing a heap of papers on his desk. “I can await your convenience. When will it be convenient for you to hand over charge?”</p>
		<p>“Yes,” he said again.</p>
		<p>I was baffled by his monosyllabic responses to all my questions. As I was puzzling over them I saw some of the clerks snickering behind his back and understood his problem. I silenced them with a stern look and repeated what I had just said, in Kannada. Krishnaji Narayan Rao looked pleased. He began to speak like an intelligent and experienced official, which he was. He was of course not proficient in English. Seeing me decked in fashionable Western clothes he used on me the only English he knew. He probably thought I was one of those WOGs (Westernized Oriental Gentlemen) who affected ignorance of native language and habits. When he saw I was prepared to speak in the native language, he became quite friendly.</p>
		<p>The people of the taluk treated me and my wife with utmost affection. Wherever we went, we used to get unlimited supplies of milk, butter, vegetables, and fruit. They used to get offended if we refused them. I remember an episode from those days that took place in a wealthy village near Chamarajnagar.</p>
		<p>The name of the Amildar involved is not needed here. It is necessary only to know that he belonged to the V.V. Iyengar school of thought in his idea of honesty. A wealthy farmer came up to the Amildar and presented him with a large lump of butter, gleaming like gold.</p>
		<p>“I am the only one in my party,” said the Amildar. “I don’t need this much butter. Weigh half a seer for me. That’s all I need.”</p>
		<p>The farmer looked flabbergasted. He was offering a gift as a mark of respect for the Maharaja’s official, and the Amildar wanted to negotiate!</p>
		<p>“My lord,” said the Patel, explaining the gesture. “Mr. Madey Gowda is a nobleman – a leader in our community. Enough food is cooked in his kitchen daily to feed thirty people. The butter is from his own farm. He is offering it as a gift in your honor with the goodwill of the whole village.”</p>
		<p>“Hah! Am I a beggar to accept something without paying for it?”</p>
		<p>“Am I a petty trader to sell produce to Maharaja’s officials?” Madey Gowda retorted. “You have your standards, I have mine.”</p>
		<p>He turned to a jangama (a penniless mendicant), standing nearby and said: “Take this with you, sir! Please go to my place and get two seers of rice and whatever else you want from my kitchen staff and enjoy.”</p>
		<p>He turned away abruptly leaving the Amildar and the rest of the party standing.</p>
		<p>I recall another Amildar from an earlier era who was living in retirement when I started my service. He had worked many years in the survey department, and in return for his diligence and loyalty, his superior had recommended him for Amildar’s position. He had attained this coveted position towards the end of his career. He was a decent man who never misused his office to enrich himself. His philosophy was as he himself described to me.</p>
		<p>“When the Sahib sent me to the taluk,” he told me, “he told me not to go after graft and bribes. I promised him I would be honest. Once you make up your mind, there is no in difficulty being honest. Yadriccha labha santusthah – be happy with what you get. When someone gives me something out of pleasure, I accept it. But I myself never demand anything. If you help someone and he gives you something in return, it is like a wedding gift. But we should never be the cause of a funeral to feed ourselves.”</p>
		<p>He was later transferred to a different taluk. This taluk was near the state capital and the people were not so simple and friendly as he had been used to. They didn’t have time for the niceties of his simple philosophy. In fact, he found them indifferent.</p>
		<p>“These people, sir,” he complained to me, “have no fear of government officials. I have to pay even to buy food and fodder for my horse. What more can I say? Last week I went to Negavanahalli and it rained there after a long dry spell. And yet, there was not one bastard to thank me for bringing the rain with my visit. Scoundrels, sir, all scoundrels! Times are really bad.”</p>
		<p>In those days, when an Amildar went on his circuit, he had quite an entourage traveling with him. This included his personal orderly, the groom for his horse, the police Dafedar, the bullock cart driver, the Shekdar of the area, clerks, a few servants, and village accountants, public works officials like the tank inspector and the works inspector, and sometimes the police inspector. None of them received any traveling allowance. Later, the Amildar was granted an allowance of one rupee a day, as I recall. It was the responsibility of the village to take care of them and provide the necessary supplies. The whole party used to eat with the Amildar in the camp. They were often joined by village notables like the Patel as well as some strangers. No one was turned away. Lunch, which was the main meal, used to be served around one in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>I changed the system somewhat. It was my practice to have lunch between eleven and twelve noon, so I used to bring my own cook to prepare my meals. Once in a while I would join the others in the general lunch.</p>

		<p>Some years later, when I was assistant commissioner (deputy collector), I felt that the authority of the Amildar was not what it used to be in my time, even though the camp arrangements had not changed much. But these things rarely come to the assistant commissioner’s attention. I recall an occasion when I was assistant commissioner and subdivision officer (SDO), I was camping in a taluk in connection with some survey work. The survey officer in charge was a seasoned professional who had worked under British officials. The Amildar and I used to join the survey officer for lunch in his camp.</p>
		<p>“Let us leave this place,” said the survey officer abruptly, immediately after lunch. “Let us go to the next village camp on our circuit.”</p>
		<p>“But we have sent notice to the people that we are camping here for two days,” the Amildar protested.</p>
		<p>“The people will come there also,” said the survey officer. “Miserable food. We even have to buy butter in the shops. No fresh vegetables. We don’t have to put up with such nonsense.”</p>
		<p>Fair enough. The same officer said in his not so perfect English, but in words full of wisdom, “It is the business of the villagers to keep us comfortable. We come on their work. Not our Papa’s work.”</p>
		<p>We went to the next village and enjoyed the fruits of his wisdom. This reminds me of another story about supplies when I was subdivision officer. My DC K. Srinivasa Rao and I were touring Chennagiri taluk. There was a Shekdar (supply officer) by name Panduranga Rao, if I remember right. He was a very able and experienced officer who always travelled with his pony carrying a small provisions bag and cooking vessels. There were several complaints against him. The main charge was that he used to extort luxury items like almonds, cream, milk, butter, and the like from every village he visited. Any village that failed to comply with his requests would face harassment by having its water cut off or its drainage repair work stalled or something else. When I made some discreet inquiries, I found that the complaints, though exaggerated, were not without basis. I sent for him and asked about the complaints.</p>
		<p>“This area is the stronghold of the Lingayat community,” he told me. “A Brahmin like me has a hard time getting even a mouthful of food from these people. So I always carry in my bag my cooking vessels and enough provisions for one meal.”</p>
		<p>“What about the luxury items I hear about?” I asked him.</p>
		<p>“A hardworking man like me needs some good food once in a while,” he replied. “So I prepare myself some enjoyable things, always paying for the ingredients.”</p>
		<p>He looked like a man who was used to eating well. I sent him away, not knowing what to do. The DC who was in the next room had overheard our conversation.</p>
		<p>“What did you decide to do about our Epicurean Shekdar?” he asked me a little later, laughing.</p>
		<p>“I can’t object if he wants to enjoy his food,” I said. “But if it is proved that he fleeces his supplies from the villagers, I’ll have to take note of it.”</p>
		<p>“For God’s sake sir, please don’t,” he appealed to me. “It warms my heart to see that even in these degenerate times there is a Shekdar who can impose his will on these insolent, insubordinate villagers. Just warn him privately not to cause any trouble.”</p>
		<p>I did as he suggested. He didn’t seem to suffer any deprivation because of it.</p>
