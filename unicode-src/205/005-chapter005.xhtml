		<p><strong><em>Trumpet service, official and unofficial. A resourceful trumpeter shows his superior his place. </em></strong></p>
		<p>Early in the year 1905, I took over charge as Amildar of Yedatore taluk in the Mysore district. Just as the state of Mysore was divided into districts (then eight), each district was divided into administrative units called taluks. The Amildar was the chief executive officer of the taluk with responsibility for revenue collection, law enforcement, and the administration of justice. Yedatore in those days had about two hundred villages and a population of around sixty thousand people. Later, when I was Amildar of the more urban Narsipur taluk, I was responsible for a population that exceeded a hundred thousand. I had under me a staff of about sixty men; the taluk police department headed by the inspector also reported to me. And I was also the presiding magistrate of the taluk court. All in all, it was a highly responsible position, not usually given to a twenty-seven-year-old youth as I then was.</p>
		<p>During my one year as probationer in Mysore I had occasion to act as Amildar of a taluk when the regular Amildar was away on leave; it was considered part of my training. During that time I had made this important discovery: to the people of princely Mysore, in those days, the Government really meant the Amildar and the deputy commissioner (DC), especially the former. To them, the Maharaja was the mostly invisible God's representative on earth, known and addressed through prayers. The king's representatives on the spot who dispensed his grace and justice were the Amildar at the local level, and the DC in the higher echelons of the Government. The Government also took care to protect the Amildar's dignity and authority.</p>
		<p>This respect and even the affection that the Amildar often commanded had its roots in tradition and history. A British Commission had ruled Mysore from 1831 to 1881, following the dismissal of the Maharaja for ‘maladministration’ of the state. The Commission had revamped the system that had suffered due to disorder and needless experimentation. They replaced former offices like the Faujdar with civil servants like the DC and the assistant commissioner. These did not exist before the Commission took over the Government.</p>
		<p>To the people of Mysore, these changes represented a major break with tradition. The position of Amildar – formerly called Subedar – had been retained however, and served as a link with their hoary past. Even in my time, more often than not, people referred to me as their Subedar. Thus, the Amildar (or Subedar) was the only high official – other than the Diwan and the Maharaja – to whom the people could still relate. Also, during the Commission rule, many officials above the grade of Amildar did not speak Kannada – the native language – which served to further increase the Amildar's authority and influence. A good deal of its residual influence still existed in my time, though I was to witness its gradual erosion with the increasing sophistication of the people. In many ways I was one of the very last of the old-time Amildars.</p>
		<div  class="inlay">
			<p><em>The dismissed ruler was Krishna Raja Wodeyar III. It was restored to his adopted son Chama Raja X in 1881. There is still controversy over whether it was justified, but in restoring it to the royal family, the British Government tacitly admitted that it had violated the treaty.</em></p>
			<p><em>The main charge, that Mysore had not paid the subsidy on time is false. Some British observes believed that the Madras Governor Thomas Munro who instigated the takeover wanted Bangalore, which has much more pleasant climate than Madras (now Chennai) for his capitol.</em></p>
			<p><em>There was also much popular discontent, some of it instigated by British agents. Part of the problem was the arbitrary rule of the usurper Tippu Sultan who uprooted many offices and institutions that had proved their worth over the centuries. So the Maharaja in 1799 inherited a shattered administrative machinery that could not cope with the challenges of a modern state. The British Commission rule marked the transition from a traditional to a modern state. This was made possible by outstanding officials – both British and Indian.</em></p>
		</div>
		<p>This situation introduced an interesting anomaly. Though a civil servant in my time, the Subedar, in former times, had ruled the taluk in the Maharaja's name, as his representative. As a result, in the eyes of the people, the Amildar was still a ruler, and it was as a ruler rather than as an administrator that he was judged. This meant that his relationship with the people more than his management of his office, determined his standing in his taluk. Anyone who understood this basic tenet and commanded the trust and confidence of the people could be assured of their loyalty and even love. Unlike today (1951) when he is little more than a book-keeper at the beck and call of every local politician, the Amildar in those days had real power. The Government too took great care to safeguard his dignity and authority. The DC was always conscious of this. Here is an incident that I personally witnessed when I was still a probationer in Mysore.</p>
		<p>Chamarajanagar is the southernmost taluk in Mysore district. One of its taluk clerks, that is to say a clerk in the Amildar's office, came to the DC to complain about his superior.</p>
		<p>"My lord," he pleaded with the DC, "someone has been carrying tales about me to the Amildar, prejudicing him against me. Why, only the other day, he was angry with me for no reason at all. When I demanded a reason, he only got worse and fined me two rupees. And he said that I could lose my job if I ever talked back to him again. I have come to appeal to you against this injustice."</p>
		<p>And he showed the Amildar's order imposing a fine on him. The DC, a mild mannered man said, "It seems extraordinary that anyone should lose his temper when all you asked was not to be angry."</p>
		<p>"It is just like him sir," the clerk went on, encouraged by the DC's mild response. "Always jumping to conclusions based on hearsay, without examining all sides. You must do something to correct his behavior."</p>
		<p>The DC smiled and wrote on the Amildar's order: "The fine has been raised to five rupees."</p>
		<p>The clerk was aghast.</p>
		<p>"Look! The Amildar fined you for insolent behavior," said the DC, speaking as softly as ever. "You seem so to me too. If an Amildar should find it fit to levy a fine of two rupees, I, as his superior officer, have to assess you for at least five. Try to be reasonable with people. If this happens again you will find yourself without a job."</p>
		<p>Before being appointed Amildar of Yedatore, I had served as acting Amildar in two taluks – Mysore and Krishnarajpet. It was considered part of my training. I served only about a month in each place, and it is difficult to make any kind of an impact in so short a time. But I do recall vividly the crowds that used to gather to look at the “boy Amildar” as they called me. And they treated me like their own favorite son. I used to go to people and ask them, "How are things in your village? Is there anything I can do for you?"</p>
		<p>Their reply invariably was, "No, my lord! We have everything we need. We are just happy to have you here." I spent a lot of time trying to shoot crocodiles that infested the Kabini River.</p>

		<p>They were especially intrigued by the sight of my coming to the taluk office to take charge dressed in my riding clothes, mounted on my thoroughbred. In fact, Venkatesha Iyengar of Masti, later to be my friend and junior colleague, claims he saw me arrive with two horses!<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-005-01">1</a></sup> He may well be right, for I did own two horses at the time, but I have no clear recollection of it. But I do remember the trumpets, the commotion, and the excitement they used to generate.</p>
		<p>When I took charge as acting Amildar, the only thing that really came under my control was the trumpet service. Those days, two trumpeters always accompanied the Amildar on duty; they used to announce the opening and the closing of all official activities with trumpet blasts. Their instruments should not be confused with those used by musicians; the trumpets we used were fashioned from cow-horn by inserting a mouthpiece with a reed, and produced a horrid scream when blown; in Kannada they are known as kombu and kahale. They did have one important virtue – their blasts could be heard a long way. Such horns were an integral part of work and ceremony in those days.</p>
		<p>As soon as I took charge of the taluk, the two trumpeters celebrated the occasion with a triumphant, simultaneous, blast of their trumpets, bringing to mind the climactic battle scene from the Bhagavad Gita:</p>
		<p>... as the blasts...</p>
		<p>Shook the foemen's hearts.</p>
		<p>With quaking earth and thundering heavens...</p>
		<p>Immediately after the regular Amildar handed over charge and left the office building, the trumpeters announced it with a blast. At the end of the day, when I got on my horse to go home, one of the trumpeters followed me at a run, blowing his trumpet all the while. As I took off at a gallop, he continued to follow me for a short distance but soon gave up. He showed up at my house a little later and announced me with a trumpet blast even though I had reached home quarter of an hour earlier. This absolutely thrilled my two little daughters. Dawn may break without the rooster crowing, but we could not escape the trumpet blasts.</p>
		<p>All through my five years as Amildar, I was treated to the luxury of the trumpet service. Our children and those of our neighbors absolutely loved the trumpeters. The fiendish screech of their instruments was music to the children's ears. Whenever one of them showed up, blew his trumpet, and saluted them, my daughters would delightedly hand over their candy money to the trumpeter. Of all my recollections from that era, few can be as vivid as those of the trumpets and the trumpeters. The trumpeter is now only a memory. The trumpet, along with its abominable discharge of sound has also disappeared; but I still hear it in my dreams. And the sound of it takes me back to a time half a century ago, and seems to bring back my youth if only for a fleeting moment.</p>
		<p>By tradition, the trumpeter was entitled to a few privileges in each town and village in the taluk. Whenever the Amildar happened to be camping in a particular village, the liquor shop had to give the trumpeter a filling of local liquor known as arrack – distilled from palm fruit – poured into his trumpet. For this reason, trumpeters used to have the inside of their horns coated with pewter metal. The trumpeter would go to the liquor shop, salute the owner with a blast, and hold up the trumpet with the large end up. The owner would then fill the trumpet with arrack. I have heard rumors of other privileges that I cannot vouch for. Their essence was— food in the house of the village chief, and bed in the house of the village madam.</p>
		<p>In every taluk I visited, the trumpeters invariably carried the same occupational names for generations – names that had nothing to do with their real names. In Yedatore, my trumpeters went by the names Dodda Yalakki and Chikka Yalakki, which may be translated as ‘Big Cardamom’ and ‘Little Cardamom’. Later, when I was Amildar of Narsipur, they were Dodda Betta and Chikka Betta – ‘Big Hill’ and ‘Little Hill’ (Mysoreans those days, like American Indians, were partial to picturesque names). Before them, their respective fathers had borne the same occupational names, as had their fathers before them. And these worthies had announced the comings and goings of Subedars to the Maharajas' subjects from generation to generation for the better part of five centuries.</p>
		<p>It should not be imagined that the trumpet service existed only as a mark of official prestige. The personal style of governance we had in those days made extensive use of trumpets and trumpeters. When the Amildar visited any village, a trumpet blast, which could be heard by the whole village, would announce that he was in town. This was the signal for the village servants to get ready to receive him. When he entered his office – either his permanent office at the taluk headquarters, or a makeshift office in the village on his circuit – the trumpets would again announce to the people that they could bring their cases to be heard by their taluk chief. At the end of the day, the trumpets would announce the closing of the workday.</p>
		<p>The trumpet service, in addition to being a useful instrument in the discharge of official duties, was an honor much coveted by junior taluk officials.</p>
		<p>I remember an amusing story involving a trumpeter and an Amildar's assistant known as Shirastedar. This had taken place in Yedatore a few years before I assumed charge. The then Amildar had gone on a few days' leave leaving his assistant in charge. This fellow had long harbored a nagging resentment that he was not receiving from his superior the respect and attention that was his due. Now that he was the acting Amildar, he decided to take advantage of the opportunity to exalt himself. And the instrument of his exaltation was to be the trumpet service, which he sought to exercise way beyond what was regular and proper in the discharge of his official duties.</p>
		<p>This put the trumpeter in an awkward position. There was only one trumpeter— for the assistant, as acting Amildar was entitled to a single trumpet; only the regular Amildar could have two trumpets blown. Such was the protocol in those days. Excessive zeal on the part of this one trumpeter, as the acting Amildar demanded, could lead to misunderstanding. The regular Amildar, though on leave, was in town and might conclude that his deputy was being accorded all this added attention on the trumpeter's own initiative. To clear the possibility of any such misunderstanding, the trumpeter stopped by the Amildar's home that night to explain the situation."My lord!" pleaded the trumpeter, "what am I to do? Your assistant demands it."</p>
		<p>"I understand," replied the Amildar. "It is attention he wants. Redouble your efforts. Don't let him stir without a trumpet blast. You understand what I mean."</p>
		<p>The trumpeter was a clever man. He understood. The acting Amildar was to know no peace from his coveted trumpet service. The poor fellow didn’t know what he was getting into.</p>
		<p>A couple of days later, in evening, as the regular Amildar was relaxing in his study, enjoying his leave from work, he was rudely awakened from gentle slumber he had fallen into, by a trumpet blast. Annoyed at this interruption he came out to investigate. There was his assistant – the acting Amildar – shaking with indignation, with the trumpeter standing right behind him.</p>
		<p>"Sir, this trumpeter is tormenting me," said the assistant. "He has his infernal instrument blaring all over the place. I can't take one step without its fiendish blast. When I go into the bathroom, he lets loose an ungodly blare. He lets out another when I come out. On my circuit – this morning – when I stopped by the roadside to go into a bush to answer a nature call, he announced it with a trumpet blast; he gave out another when I returned. Last night, when my wife and I were going into the bedroom, we were startled to hear a trumpet blast from just outside the window. It is humiliating. He has made me the laughing stock of the town. Now everyone in town knows my daily schedule down to the smallest detail. And he refuses to stop without your order."</p>
		<p>The trumpeter announced his complaint also with a trumpet blast.</p>
		<p>"You see Mr. Acting Amildar," said his superior, controlling himself with the greatest difficulty, "these are some of the pains that come with high office. Being a ruler is no bed of roses. I just wanted to make sure that during my absence you would receive every honor that is your due. Nothing should be amiss. I see now that the trumpeter has done his job only too well. Don't worry. I'll instruct him properly."</p>
		<p>Then turning to the trumpeter he said:</p>
		<img src="images/0025.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p><strong>Devanahalli fort : </strong>Located 35 kilometers north of Bangalore, Devanahalli is now the site of the Bangalore International Airport. It is famous as the birthplace of Tipu Sultan.</p>
		<p>"Yalakki! It is not necessary for the world to know his bathroom and bedroom detail. Just announce the opening and closing of the daily work schedule."</p>
		<p>"As you wish my lord!" said the trumpeter, saluting them both as he left – this time without a trumpet blast.</p>
		<p>One more story about the trumpets. This took place in Devana Halli, my ancestral place, at a time when my father was still a youngster (c. 1850). Amildars those days had enormous authority, and used to conduct themselves with the style and bearing of royalty. The Amildar of Devanahalli at the time was one Srinivasa Rao, a man of imperious bearing. (He might be the same man who in old age admitted to his infidelity, but this is just a guess.) Devanahalli is an ancient and historic town surrounded by an old fort. He used to live in a palatial house inside the fort. On his way to his office, he would always go through the main street (or market street) where all the shops were located.</p>
		<p>His daily transit from his home to his office was a ceremonial affair, almost like a royal march. A trumpet blast would announce that he had left the fort, and another, a few minutes later, when he entered the market. Immediately, the shopkeepers and the customers would line up outside the shops awaiting his arrival. Sometimes he would be on horseback, holding a white umbrella in one hand; at other times he would be on foot, walking majestically in the shade of a large white umbrella carried by a police officer. In either case, he would always be preceded by two uniformed policemen, and followed by four taluk servants in livery. In days gone by they used to have blazing ceremonial torches accompanying this parade, even in daytime. The practice had been given up when some bright Amildar made the discovery that artificial lights are not needed in broad daylight.</p>
		<p>As this parade wound its way through the main street, all the shopkeepers would stand up and salute the Amildar. This practice had continued into my own day – just the salute that is, not the procession with day torches. When someone, being either new to the place or just more than ordinarily dense, failed to stand up and salute, others would signal to him. It was a time-honored practice.</p>
		<p>Back to the Devanahalli of Srinivasa Rao's time; a newcomer to the town – a merchant who had made a fortune in Bangalore and Madras – felt that such feudal practices were beneath him. Also, for some unknown reason, he wanted to impress upon the people his own importance by humiliating the Amildar and make him react with undignified anger. He had settled in Devanahalli only recently, opening a shop in the market. Each day, as the Amildar and his entourage arrived on its daily march, this merchant would not only fail to show his respect as custom demanded, but would go out of his way to show off his own importance. He made it a point to draw attention to himself by assuming a conspicuously languid pose on his couch, loudly calling on his attendant to adjust his pillow, or footstool, or some such thing.</p>
		<p>The town natives were not at all happy with this open show of disrespect for royal authority. A few people tried reasoning with him.</p>
		<p>"Why do behave like this?" they asked him. "What do you hope to gain by it?"</p>
		<p>"My couch, my pillows, my feet – well, they all belong to me!" he replied. "I don't need the Amildar's or anybody else's permission to do whatever I damn well please with them!"</p>
		<p>When informed of it, the Amildar ignored the whole thing and advised everyone to do the same. This frustrated the merchant. He was doing all this to attract some attention to himself, but no one seemed to care. Then, one day, he had a brilliant idea. He would employ his own trumpeter! This would surely upstage the Amildar in a way no one could ignore. People were shocked at this effrontery. Several men, claiming to be his well-wishers, but probably acting on the Amildar's behalf, advised him against it.</p>
		<p>"You are a fool to court the enmity of the powerful," they told him. His response was again the same.</p>
		<p>"I have paid for the trumpet, and I pay the trumpeter for his service. They both belong to me. What I choose to do with them is nobody's business but my own. There is no law against it."</p>
		<p>His trumpet service went on for a few days. He would have the trumpet blown every morning and evening, to mark the opening and closing of his shop. He seemed mighty pleased with himself. But within a few days he began to notice something strange. Every morning, as his trumpet announced the opening of his shop, a rather bulky, powerfully-built man would be standing right in front of his shop relieving himself in public. At first the merchant tried to ignore it, but this unwholesome greeting was taking place much too regularly to be accidental. He also learnt that the culprit was a clerk or a copyist in the Amildar's office. He was tempted to have him evicted by force, but realized that the case would be tried in the Amildar's court if he laid a hand on the man. He decided his best course was to try to talk him out of this foul practice. The next day, after the man had performed his daily ritual, the merchant confronted him.</p>
		<p>"Do you think it is proper for you to be behaving like this?" the merchant asked him. "Have you no shame— a grown man exposing and relieving yourself like cattle? Right in front of my servants; have you no sense of decency?"</p>
		<p>"Sir!" replied the man. "It seems there never was much shame or decency here to begin with. You trumpet yourself because it belongs to you. Parts of my body – and what they discharge – don't they belong to me? I'm only following your example."</p>
		<p>The merchant saw the point. His trumpet service stopped. He became more affable and cultivated the Amildar's friendship and goodwill, soon becoming a leading and respected member of the community.</p>
		<p>This had happened some fifty years before my time. I heard it from one of my elders.</p>
		<p>Returning to my own time, shortly before I was to take charge as Amildar of Yedatore, V.V. Iyengar had been appointed chief secretary in Bangalore, and an Englishman by name Sparkes had replaced him as DC. In the interim, my friend Kantha Raje Urs had been acting DC. Sparkes had a formidable reputation as a rider. In those days, it was not sufficient to be good in studies and office work to be effective as a civil servant. Horsemanship was required of all officials; back then, the horse was the principal means of transportation. I didn’t mind it, for I have always been fond of outdoor activities of all kinds – especially hunting.</p>
		<p>When I began my service as probationer in Mysore, I learnt horse riding and shooting along with my office work. According to the standing order in those days, all Amildars had to learn riding and obtain a certificate of proficiency from the Cavalry Department. A few somehow managed to get these certificates without having mastered it, but it was not always wise. Padmanabha Rao, who took the Civil Service Examination with my batch and placed first, was killed in a riding accident. He was killed when he lost control of a fairly ordinary horse.</p>
		<p>I became an accomplished rider and took great pride in my horses. I also bought a Winchester repeating rifle and a Webley and Scott revolver, spending more money than I could really afford at the time. Some people who disliked exerting themselves would sometimes try to avoid traveling by horseback if they could. But this could backfire on them as in the following episode involving Sparkes himself and an Amildar who could not ride.</p>
		<p>Sparkes, as I just noted, had the reputation of being a hard rider. He was also something of a bully who seemed to take special delight in intimidating people who were not good horsemen. He invited the Amildar to accompany him on a trip to inspect some public works.</p>
		<p>"Oh, come on Amildar! Let us go riding at seven tomorrow morning," said the DC. "It is only ten miles. We'll be there in an hour."</p>
		<p>The Amildar had to agree even though he could not ride. He went home that night trying to come up with a suitable excuse for not accompanying the DC. The next morning, Sparkes showed up at the appointed hour. The Amildar received him, his face wearing an expression of great physical pain, borne with resolute courage. Sparkes was in his riding outfit.</p>
		<p>"Are you ready?" the DC asked him. "It is only ten miles. We shall be there in an hour."</p>
		<p>"I have made all the arrangements for your inspection," replied the Amildar. "But I shall not be able to go. I am not well at all. You should permit me to stay back."</p>
		<p>"Why? What is the matter?" asked the DC, seemingly quite concerned.</p>
		<p>What was the Amildar to do? With no hint of any fever, his options were limited. So he claimed to be having a severe stomach ache.</p>
		<p>"One must never neglect a stomach ache," said Sparkes. "I'll personally take you to the doctor."</p>
		<p>Sparkes took the Amildar to the hospital close to the district office.</p>
		<p>"Doctor Sahib!" said Sparkes to the doctor, "please give my friend here an ounce of castor oil."</p>
		<p>And with a great show of concern, he forced the Amildar to drink all of it. He then asked the doctor to give him another ounce, and forced the hapless Amildar to drink that dose also. He refused to listen to the Amildar's protests.</p>
		<p>"Your life is very valuable to me. Do you want me to get you another dose? Please don't feel shy."</p>
		<p>The Amildar thanked him saying that he was quite full.</p>
		<p>"Enough is as good as a feast," responded the DC.</p>
		<p>"You may go home now," Sparkes finally said to the Amildar. "You have nothing to worry. You have had enough castor oil to keep you busy for the rest of the day. But let me tell you this much: If you couldn't ride, you should have said so. We could have gone by some other means. Why give this story about the stomach ache? Perhaps you just enjoy drinking castor oil.”</p>
