<p><strong><em>Rama Rao takes charge as Amildar of Yedatore. Meeting Ballakki Seena, a man with a cavernous appetite. </em></strong></p>
<p>Following my appointment as Amildar, I left for Yedatore with my family. I realized that I had reached the boundary of my authority, the taluk boundary, when I was greeted by a welcoming arch and a group of people carrying fruits, flowers, and other paraphernalia. There were trumpets and horns being blown in every village. My daughters were delighted to see all the fruits and flowers. My wife, on the other hand, was disturbed. “They are welcoming us so lavishly,” she said. “What do they expect us to do for them in return?” she wondered aloud.</p>
<p>We reached Yedatore around three in the afternoon. I signed the necessary papers taking charge of the taluk office and went to the Traveler’s Bungalow for a late lunch. I had sent my cook the previous day with the necessary provisions. But when I got there, it was like a food festival with numerous strangers and stragglers. My wife and I drove away the undesirables, but the following men still remained.</p>
<p>Choultry manager</p>
<p>A choultry servant, Ballakki Seena (more of him later)</p>
<p>Cook Puttanna</p>
<p>Shekdar on duty (supply officer)</p>
<p>Patel</p>
<p>The temple manager</p>
<p>In addition, there were some seven or eight people that we could not account for. The choultry in those days was a public facility, usually attached to and administered by a temple. It was intended as a facility for visitors from out of town where they could rest briefly before continuing their journey. I had the cook bring our lunch to the room where we were staying.</p>
<p>After my lunch, I made inquiries regarding the chaotic situation that was prevailing earlier in the afternoon. I learnt that three seers of rice and other provisions were brought from the choultry to prepare food for all of us. It made me furious. The choultry is a public facility, maintained at government expense as a service to visitors from out of town. It is not something to be used for entertaining taluk and village officials. I threatened the manager that I would deduct unauthorized expenses from his salary. He told me that he had instructions from the head clerk. The head clerk told me that the Shirastedar had instructed him. And the Shirastedar told me in secret that the departing Amildar – the one whom I had just replaced – had instructed him to have the food prepared for me, not knowing how late it would be before I arrived. So, with the best of intentions the whole thing had been mismanaged. Not so rare an occurrence.</p>
<p>Ballakki Seena intrigued me. ‘Ballakki’ means two seers of rice, or more than four pounds. He had been awarded the title because of his capacity to consume that much rice (with sambar, curds, etc) at one sitting. This is easily four times the portion of a normal healthy man. I have read somewhere that men who cause destruction on a massive scale become more famous than those who create and bring happiness to the world. I had heard that there were prize winning farmers who could grow twenty-five pallas of rice an acre, but this required land, fertilizer, and hard work. But Seena could single-handedly destroy this harvest in a matter of months, without turning a hair. I sent for him.</p>
<p>Seena was a tall, dark, man of about twenty-five, not at all of powerful build. He bore an emaciated look, with a stomach that almost seemed to meet his back. I regarded him with respect, the kind of respect due from a mere four ouncer to a four pounder.</p>
<p>“How did you get the name Ballakki Seena?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“I am supposed to eat a ‘balla’ of ‘akki’ in a meal sir,” he said.</p>
<p>“Can you really eat that much?” I asked in amazement.</p>
<p>“Where to find that much every day, sir?” he asked. “On some days I get less, on other days I get a little more. So it all works out to about that much on the average.”</p>
<p>It must have been one of his ‘more days,’ with the choultry staff having to themselves all the food cooked for my family and the party. The situation was far from satisfactory. Seena was a choultry servant, nominally an employee, but did little work beyond eating. To allot two seers of rice to feed this one man meant running the choultry solely for his benefit. No household could afford to employ him as a servant because of his cavernous appetite. In addition, he had no skills. In these ancient charitable institutions called choultries, men like him were like pests who destroyed provisions.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to get rid of him because that could drive him to a life of crime – or he may starve to death. Finally, I gave instructions that the choultry should get as much work out of the man as possible and give him half a seer of rice a day. It still meant twice a normal man’s ration. He could do additional work and earn more if he wanted. This was regarded as a very hard ruling on my part.</p>
<p>“Can you not reconsider it, sir?” my Shirastedar asked me. “The poor fellow has to live.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know why he has to live,” I said. “When he destroys enough food to feed eight productive people, there has to be some justification for such consumption.”</p>
<p>Actually it seemed to do him a lot of good. A life of hard work, making him earn his food, improved him and gave him some self-respect.</p>
<p>I spent the next two years in Yedatore – now known as Krishnarajanagara. In the forty-six years since I left the place (1907), its face has changed beyond recognition. I know the taluk very well. I had seen every village in the taluk many times. I have camped in them in the heat of summer, in driving rain, in times of sorrow, and in the midst of festive happiness. I knew intimately its people – and understood their ways and their problems. There were few families in the taluk that I did not know; those that had not seen me were fewer still. In the system of government we then had, the Amildar was its father and mother. Every taluk is made up of people both good and bad. A good person will not be good in all respects or at all times. We all have our lapses. But even today, as I reach the end of my life, I think of the people of Yedatore, full of affection as with my own family. I recall one incident, which brings back to me the love the people had for me.</p>
<img src="images/0026.jpg" alt="image" />
<p>This took place some twenty years later, when I was motoring down from Hassan to Mysore via Holay Narsipur. (This was when Rama Rao was Secretary to the Government.) I stopped at a village – Geradada as I recall – for some water for the car radiator from the public well. It was early in the afternoon, and there were quite a few women by the well. I asked a young woman if I could borrow her vessel to draw water from the well. Instead she handed me her full vessel and told me to use the water for the car. How to thank her? I tried to pay her with a rupee coin.</p>
<p>“Are we townspeople, sir, to sell water?” she said with laughter mixed with some annoyance. She turned to an older woman standing by and said, “Look sister! These people have seen money, and we are poor.”</p>
<p>I felt a bit ashamed.</p>
<p>“Please don’t be angry with me lady,” I said. “The well is deep, and you had to work hard to draw the water. I don’t have any other way of thanking you, so I thought I would pay you for your effort.”</p>
<p>“This is nothing, sir,” said an older woman, about my own age. “Twenty-five years ago we had to bring water from Attikuppe – traveling seven or eight miles from here. In those days, we could quiet crying children by telling them we would give them water to drink. We got this well only because of the boy Subedar we had – one Navaratna Rama Rao. May his life be blessed!”</p>
<p>“Wherever he is – why don’t you give him your money,” laughed the young woman, who gave me the water.</p>
<p>They all left me, laughing as they returned to the well. Their mirth seemed to be directed at me. Who could have imagined when I had the sense to have the well dug twenty years ago, that people would remember and thank me for it. It was after all my duty as a servant of the Maharaja. It was his grace, I was only the instrument. Considering how much happiness I derived from my work as Amildar, my salary of rupees one hundred and seventy-five was just a gift. When I reflect back in my old age, I am convinced that all the money we receive is a gift. Only the happiness we get from performing our duty is our reward. <strong>[Sic: </strong>The doctrine of duty taught by Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
<p>Yedatore is now called Krishnarajanagara. It is not just the name that has changed, but the whole landscape and environment. To old timers like me, it has changed beyond recognition. As the name indicates, Yedatore stood on the left bank of the river. There were houses on both sides of the main road. The river flowed behind the row of houses on the right side of the road. At the west end of the town, on the river stood the Arkeshwara Temple, adjacent to the bathing ghat. (See photo on page 62). It is no exaggeration to say that the temple was the heart of the town. At the other end of the town were the Traveler’s Bungalow and the Taluk Office. When I first saw Yedatore, it brought to my mind the vision of an old and infirm man who at one time was wealthy and had enjoyed a full and prosperous life. It had a reputation of being malarial and unhealthy. The previous Amildar had fallen ill and moved to the village of Hampapur, about a mile and a half from Yedatore. I too lived in Hampapur for quite some time.</p>
<p>In those days, the Amildar was accountable to the deputy commissioner (DC). This allowed him to carry out his duties without distractions from other sources. Today, it seems that he can do nothing without the support of various political and community leaders. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches, but I only know that the work doesn’t proceed as smoothly as it did in my time.</p>
<p>Yedatore was fairly typical of the taluks in Mysore at that time. I was familiar with several of them – T. Narsipur, Gundalpet, Hunsur, and some others. All of them more or less resembled Yedatore in their social organization. Brahmins had not yet lost their social prominence; Lingayats (or Veerashaivas) were less influential than today. All communities (except Lingayats) accepted the Brahmins as leaders. Except for the small number in government service, Brahmins were engaged mainly in their traditional priestly occupations. Even those who owned lands remained attached to their traditional vocations of priesthood and Vedic learning.</p>

<p>The capitalists and men of wealth were the Vaishyas and Jains. They considered themselves disciples of the Brahmins whom they often consulted. A few educated Brahmins misused their talents working as unscrupulous lawyers and lobbyists. (Of course, there were many decent lawyers also!)</p>
<p>The Amildar was the unchallenged leader of the community. The doctor, the postmaster, the schoolmaster, the sub-registrar and all other officials accepted the Amildar’s position as leader. The main reason was that he derived his authority as the representative of the Maharaja. The Amildar’s circle of friends often included private citizens of distinction. One of them in Yedatore was an elderly Maratha landowner by name Shivaji Rao. He was a close friend of my father-inlaw Ananda Tirtha Rao who was like a second father to me. Shivaji Rao used to own hundreds of acres of canal irrigated lands. He also had a money-lending business running into lakhs of rupees. He was a gentle and kind man but did not mix easily with people. His son, the late Devoji </span>Rao, was a very dear friend of mine. His family history sheds light on the unusual relationship that could develop between the British and the Hindus during the commission period (when Mysore was ruled by a British commission, 1831-81).</p>
<p>Two of Shivaji Rao’s ancestors used to work for a British officer by name Montgomery in the Bombay Presidency. (Captain Hugh Montgomery, superintendent, Ashtagram Division, in the 1840s.) He brought them with him when he came to Mysore as a high official during the Commission days, making them Subedars within a short period. As he was about to retire he awarded them all the land they wanted. How can any official today – bound by rules and regulations – match the unbounded authority and generosity of this British official in making a gift of land that didn’t even belong to him! <strong>[Sic: </strong>Would he be so generous in his native Britain? <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
<p>Villages in those days had a life and character of their own. The old order may have loosened somewhat, but had not entirely disappeared. Terms like ‘good village’ or ‘troublesome village’ had real meaning. Each village had leaders who enjoyed the trust and affection of the local people. Most disputes were settled locally – before the village elders. Any disputes and differences between villages used to come to the attention of the Amildar. Even family disputes – between brothers or between husband and wife – would be brought to the Amildar camping in the village.</p>
<p>In some villages, especially when a particular community happened to be prominent, local authority could be quite powerful. I recall one incident in such a village, which was located on the river dividing our state from a British province (I was not the Amildar of the taluk containing the village.) When the Amildar was camping in the area, some villagers came and complained to him about a terrible menace. A scoundrel would cross the boundary and try to molest lonely women on our side working in the fields. He would then cross the river and escape into British territory and evade our law. This distressed the Amildar greatly. He suggested to the villagers to somehow catch and bring the culprit to him, and he would punish the man suitably. He heard nothing more about the incident. When he camped again in the village a couple of months later, he asked about the problem.</p>
<p>“Oh, it was nothing sir,” a villager told him. “A small girl saw a strange man fishing and ran away scared. The story grew as it spread by word of mouth. We heard nothing more about it.”</p>
<p>Upon further inquiry, the Amildar learnt the truth. The villagers set a trap for the rogue and managed to catch him in the act. They tried him in the village court and sentenced him to death. After executing him, they threw his body into the river, which was then in full spate. There was no trace of him, nor any evidence relating to the incident. Had they brought him to court, it would be months before any judgment could be obtained. Decent women would be forced to give evidence and face unpleasant questions from lawyers. The criminal would probably have got off with a minor sentence. What the villagers did was decidedly against the law, but I have not the courage to say it was against justice.</p>
<p>When I took charge as Amildar, my DC was an Englishman by name Sparkes – the same one who had forced a hapless Amildar who could not ride, to drink several doses of castor oil for being unable to ride. It was unusual for an Englishman to be serving in the Mysore Maharaja’s Government at that time, for the administration was entirely in Indian hands (Some English coffee planters of Hassan and Chikmagalur District had appealed to the Maharaja through the British Resident that only an Englishman should be their Deputy Commissioner. Sparkes, then manager of a coffee estate, had been appointed to the post. He had been transferred to Mysore district as DC for a year or so before he retired. Kantha Raje Urs succeeded him.) There were officials like him during the British Commission rule; there were none before the Commission, there are none now, and there will never again be any in the future. Sparkes and others like him appeared for a fleeting period in the history of our ancient land as the result of a historical accident. They have vanished without a trace and I want to preserve for posterity the memory of the species. Even more, I want to record how the people in my time viewed these alien creatures, before every trace of the memory of these encounters is permanently lost.</p>
<p>In the eyes of our people, the European or the Firangi, was of large and sturdy build, whose indulgence in good food and copious drink had given him a ruddy face. Unbridled authority had given him an air of power, and a temperament that did not readily tolerate contradiction or criticism. His knowledge of our language was limited to a few useful phrases like, "Bring whisky and soda," "Is the dinner ready?" "Bring the horse around," and the like. Educated Indians soon saw that even in his native English, his knowledge was no better than average. This man (Sparkes) had worked in a coffee plantation before joining the Government. His language was somewhat rustic, and when angry – to which he was rather easily prone – he tended to be a little too profane for refined tastes.</p>
<p><strong>[Sic: </strong>Rama Rao here is referring to the average Britisher in India and to Sparkes in particular. There were of course Britishers like Sir William Jones and Sir Thomas Colebrook who made significant contributions to Indian scholarship. There were also men like Tait and Rama Rao’s friend Lewis Rice who were educators and antiquarians and served with distinction in the Maharaja’s Government. <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
<p>But in the case of Sparkes, this rough exterior concealed a basically kind heart, especially towards the poor and the helpless, believing firmly that the British were their only salvation. He was just to the extent of his limited ability, and honest by the standards of those days, which meant he did not succumb to bribes. He could be counted upon to go all out to help those who were in his good graces. The approach to his divinity was through his butler – brought in from the neighboring Madras – for native Mysoreans never served foreigners as household workers. This cook or butler was also his high priest. When the butler said he would give the master a good meal and talk about it, the petitioner could be sure that the end was as good as accomplished.</p>
<p>This white Sirdar firmly believed that his race was superior to the Indians in every way, and ruled us for our own good, being appointed by God to carry what they called the "White Man's Burden." This, he believed was their mission, and to those that acquiesced to it, whatever they did in its cause was justified. This delusion seemed to cloud the perception of our ruling classes also. For the cause of this we must look in our history, but the result of this belief was evident to those who shared the time and place.</p>
<p>As soon as I took charge of the taluk, I was deluged with orders from Sparkes. He was not especially proficient in government work; he relied more on quantity and intensity of orders than on careful study and analysis for which he was not equipped. Three days after I had assumed charge, I received a memo complaining, "The Amildar has not finalized annual jamabandi (annual revenue settlement). He seems to be very lazy."</p>
<p>When I pointed out to him that I had been on duty for only two days, with an entire year's worth of accounts to consolidate, he retorted, "I want results shown in actions, not exchange of letters." Then finally, in his choicest English, "You don't seem to know your job!"</p>
<p>I decided the best course was to ignore his outbursts and concentrate on the work at hand. Even though I had passed the revenue exams, I had no previous experience with accounting. But I have always regarded it a shame to be ignorant of any aspect of any work done under my charge, no matter how minor. I spent many hours with my clerks and experienced Shanbogs and thoroughly familiarized myself with their procedures, until even the most complex of financial statements held no terrors for me. This was the beginning of the mastery of financial procedures and attention to detail for which I was to be known throughout my career.</p>
<p>Then, within a month of my taking charge of Yedatore, a couple of clerks from the DC's office came by and electrified my staff by announcing that DC Sparkes Sahib would be paying us an official visit the following day at tea time.</p>
