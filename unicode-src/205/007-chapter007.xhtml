<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">7 COMMISSIONER SPARKES SAHIB</p/>
<p><strong><em>The visit of deputy commissioner Sparkes. An inauspicious beginning. Indian theories about the origin of Europeans. An unusual method of hauling trash. </em></strong></p>
<p>One of the district office clerks who brought the news about Sparkes' impending visit also cautioned me about him.</p>
<p>"You need to be a little careful with him, sir," he said to me. "Our acting DC, Kantha Raje Urs, has great regard for you but he is one of us. This new Sahib is different. He is very short-tempered and doesn't care for anybody. I have never heard him speak without using ‘damn’ or ‘bloody’. For all that, he is basically a good man."</p>
<p>The dreaded day dawned. As Sparkes was not expected until tea time, I went on my usual morning rounds to supervise some municipal works, and returned to my office just before noon and began reviewing some accounts. The Traveler’s Bungalow – the place where Sparkes would be staying – and the taluk office, were situated on the same premises by the river, and shared a common entrance from the main road. I caught a glimpse of the DC's butler arranging things in the bungalow. I alighted from my horse and got into some casual conversation with one of the local merchants who happened to be at the taluk office on some business. Just then, I heard the persistent ringing of a bicycle bell behind me, which made me turn around in some annoyance. As I did, I noticed a European man cycling towards me, his face looking red and angry in the late morning sun. I was sure it was my DC. But according to his own clerk’s report, he was not due to arrive until much later in the afternoon!</p>
<p>"Good morning," I said greeting him.</p>
<p>"Good morning, and who are you?" he snapped.</p>
<p>"I am the Amildar," I replied. "May I know if I am speaking to the deputy commissioner (DC)?"</p>
<p>"You jolly well are, damn you!" he shot back. "What the hell do you think you are doing here? What sort of a bloody Amildar are you – not to meet me at your taluk boundary?"</p>
<p>He was acting so incensed that I half expected him to come up and physically attack me.</p>
<p>"There is no need to swear at me," I told him. "I didn't know you were arriving so early. Your clerks told me you were not coming till evening."</p>
<p>"That is a damned lie," he said as he disappeared into the Traveler’s Bungalow.</p>
<p>This exchange took place right in front of my subordinates; a few clerks from the DC's office were also present to witness my humiliation. Even though our conversation had been in English, several of them had at least a smattering of the language and had caught the gist of our exchange. His tone and manner of speaking also had left little room for doubt. Such language and behavior were unthinkable in the circles I was used to. It sent me into a cold fury, and my revulsion at his behavior made me almost feverish. In my one year in the Government, my dealings had been with gentlemen and aristocrats like V.V. Iyengar and Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs, and never a brute like this. There was no way I could swallow this humiliation.</p>
<p>Right there, I decided that I would not let him get away with such behavior. I cared nothing if I were to be fired as Amildar – I had my lawyer's profession to fall back on – but I would certainly teach him some manners. In my youthful imagination, I also resolved to exercise my physical prowess if necessary, believing that as a trained wrestler in top condition I was more than a match for him.</p>
<p><strong>[Sic: </strong>It is worth noting that Rama Rao was fully capable of carrying it through. He had once been expelled from a school for assaulting a teacher who had punished him unfairly. But Dr. Walton, the principal of the London Mission School in Bangalore had decided to admit him to his school, feeling that the teacher had been at fault for provoking the youngster to such extreme. Still he lost some time in school because of it. <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
<p>While these thoughts were playing through my mind, I tried to control myself and went on with my work of reviewing financial statements with the village accountants in my office. In about half an hour or so, Srinivasa Murthy, a writer from the DC's office, came to me and said, "The Sahib has had his tea. He wishes to know what you are doing."</p>
<p>"Can't you see for yourself," I replied indifferently. "I'm rather busy."</p>
<p>"Shall I tell him so?" he asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>This was the same ‘failed M.A. Srinivasa Murthy’ – as Sparkes’s predecessor V.V. Iyengar had introduced him to me. Clerks and other subordinates in senior officers' offices would sometimes try to browbeat junior officials, but I had always refused to countenance Srinivasa Murthy's sense of self-importance. This had long been a sore point with him. He was now trying to gain an edge in the aftermath of my recent humiliation at the hands of his superior. I stood my ground, refusing to give him the chance.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "unless you wish to give him false information about me, just as you did to me about him." (It is possible that Murthy had deliberately given wrong information about the Sahib’s time of arrival.)</p>
<p>Before he could say anything more, the Sahib himself left the Traveler’s Bungalow and stepped into my office.</p>
<p>"How long have you been Amildar here?" he asked me. "You are much too young to be Amildar."</p>
<p>"If you want me to answer your questions," I said, facing up to him, looking him squarely in the eye, "you must express regret for what you said a little while ago. You swore at me for no reason at all and called me a ‘damned liar’. I am a gentleman and claim to be treated as such. I refuse to take any notice of you unless you apologize."</p>
<p>I was certain he was going to try to hit me, and stood ready assuming a stance suitable for effective retaliation with my wrestling skills. I must have presented a ludicrous sight. At first, he flushed angrily, bit his lip and then regarded me looking quite puzzled.</p>
<p>"What is biting you now?" he asked, coming in close to me. "Oh, that! Couldn't you see I was damn tired, my dear fellow? Funny sort of Amildar are you— who wants an apology from his own DC for a hasty word! That is what comes from college and university learning I suppose. Well, I never! But since you want it, yes I am sorry. I didn't mean it – not a word of it."</p>
<p>And he held out his hand. I was so nonplussed by his unexpected behavior that tears started in my eyes. Sparkes kindly put his hand on my shoulder saying, "Come on. Don't be silly," and led me into the Traveler's Bungalow. He then asked me all about myself— why a young fellow like me wanted to bury himself in government service.</p>
<p>When during the course of our conversation he learnt that I had my basic education at the Bangalore Central College, he asked, "Oh, I see! Then you know Tait Sahib?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I replied. "He is my guru – my mentor. I owe him more than I owe any man, except my own father."</p>
<p>"So, you are a student of Tait Sahib," he laughed. "That explains your pricklishness. He has shaped you in his own Scottish mould!”</p>

<p>I was so young and impressionable that by then I had been completely won over by this man of whom most people were in awe, and who just an hour ago had seemed such a monster to me. I sat with him while he ate his lunch.</p>
<p>"You have been here the whole day," he said as we came out of his lodgings. "Are you trying to save money by not eating? Go home and be here at five. We'll go out and chalk out a program for tomorrow."</p>
<p>As I left Sparkes and walked to my horse, his clerk Srinivasa Murthy approached me and said, "Sir, you have the Sahib in your pocket."</p>
<p>I was offended by his remark.</p>
<p>"He is a big man," I said to him, "and I'll only tell you what he himself might say – now, don't be a bloody fool and mind your own damn business."</p>
<p>I then left instructions for the afternoon and went home for lunch.</p>
<p>By the time we were ready for our evening circuit, Sparkes' horse had not yet arrived from Mysore. He suggested that we go on our inspection on bicycles and asked me if I could ride one and that slowly. I told him I could and borrowed the police jemadar's bicycle. As we set forth on our bicycles, the streets were filled to overflowing with people. Even the balconies of houses were filled with women and children trying to catch a glimpse of the white man. Mysore, though technically a ‘subsidiary state’ of the British Empire, it was ruled by the Maharaja, and the people had no direct contact with the British. Europeans were an extremely rare sight in the villages, and many had never seen one. This had given rise to the most outlandish theories to explain their origins and dominance in the world at the time.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to recognize that the anti-colonial sentiment prevalent in the world today had not yet taken root in Mysore, or even in much of India. For the better part of four centuries, Mysore had been a feudal kingdom, acknowledging first the Vijaynagar Emperor as overlord, and now the British had taken the place of Vijaynagar. It would be something of an anachronism to attribute any anti-colonial sentiments to the Maharaja's subjects; they simply had no conception of being a colony. They were for the most part perfectly happy with the Maharaja's rule and the nationalist movement never made much headway in Mysore. In fact, the subjects regarded the Wodeyar ruling house with great love and devotion, as will become increasingly clear during the course of my narrative.</p>
<p>The common people therefore had only a vague notion that their own ruler was subordinate to the ‘big’ king or queen in England, and that white men were somehow privileged rulers all over the world. Some people sought explanation for this in our history and mythology. Lord Rama, according to the Indian epic the ‘Ramayana’, was assisted in his conquests by an army of monkeys led by the hero Hanuman. One school of thought held that the power and wealth of Englishmen was due to the grace of Lord Rama whom their ancestors had served as monkey warriors. Their red faces were proof enough of their ancestry; and their antics when angry lent further support to the theory of Englishmen as descendants of apes. It was also believed by those subscribing to this school of thought, that every white man still retained a rudimentary tail growth that proclaims his origins. And an educated few, who had just been exposed to the basics of Darwin's Theory of Evolution, claimed they now had scientific proof of their theory.</p>
<p>The more scholarly among the people pooh-poohed such explanations and looked to the other great epic, the Mahabharata for an explanation. Europeans are the same as Afghans, so went this school, for some Afghans too have red faces, light eyes, and brown hair. According to these scholars, Arjuna, a hero of the ‘Mahabharata’, had Europeans in his army when he had fought against Gandhara, as Afghanistan was then known. Impressed by their valor, he settled some of them in Gandhara as a reward for their service.</p>
<p>With this extraordinary pedigree, it is hardly surprising that Sparkes was such a star attraction to the villagers. To top it, this red-faced man was riding a bicycle! Bicycles were then rarer than helicopters today, and to the villagers, it was like going to the circus and watching a bear ride a bicycle. While we were entertaining the villagers in this fashion, Sparkes came across a sight that he very likely never saw again in his life. I had not planned it as part of his visit; but it is an amusing story nevertheless, that was not without some beneficial results. Here is the gist of it.</p>

			<figcaption><em>Donkey carts like those used for hauling trash in Yedatore</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Upon taking charge as Amildar, I found Yedatore overflowing with stray donkeys. The grating noise of their braying at all hours of the day and night gave little respite to its citizens. Their search for food, their amorous acts and battles, and their vocal virtuosity, were incessant</p>
<p>sights and sounds in the streets and fields of Yedatore. They had wrought havoc in the yard of the Travelers’ Bungalow and in the fields and farms around. All too often, whenever we had a meeting of bipeds in the taluk office, there would be a competing meeting of these noisy quadrupeds just outside, sometimes forcing us to shout at the top of our voices, just to make ourselves heard over the din created by their communal braying.</p>
<p>These pests would not allow any vegetable or flower garden to be grown. I considered organizing a volunteer party to shoot these creatures, but no one wanted any part of it; though our people like hunting, no one – me included – cared to shoot these tame animals. It was no use tying them up, for nobody would come forward to claim them. We tried auctioning them, but there were no bidders. Then a possible solution to the problem came to me in a flash.</p>
<p>Shortly after assuming charge, I was going over the catalogue of a company called T.A. Ponnu and Company of Madras. The company supplied light transportation and hauling equipment to city municipalities. As I was leafing through their catalogue, I came across a listing describing a small cart that could be used for hauling trash and other light loads. It struck me that these could be drawn by donkeys; it would be novel – we would get our work done, and the evasive owners also might come forward to claim their animals. With this arrangement, the animals would now become more valuable and be better taken care of, and hopefully stop being such pests.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I picked out a dozen of these animals, selecting those that seemed fittest to me and announced a public auction. No one came. The city bought them with nominal bids. I had rope and leather harnesses made for them, and also had the animals trained which was easy enough. Within a few days, the transformation of these creatures was remarkable; they looked as different from stray animals as a uniformed policeman does from a street vagabond. The scheme worked well, with fewer stray donkeys in the streets, and the city also had an efficient and inexpensive means of hauling trash and other light loads. We had four such carts. As we were making our rounds, Sparkes and I came across two of them.</p>
<p>Sparkes was intrigued by the sight and asked me for an explanation. Something in the whole episode tickled his fancy and he just could not stop laughing for several minutes; in fact, we had to stop for a few minutes just so he could regain control of himself.</p>
<p>"Splendid! Splendid!" he kept exclaiming, clapping his hands.</p>
<p>We next went into the front yard of the main temple of Yedatore to be greeted by the priest and some leading Brahmins. Sparkes, though the Maharaja's representative, was not a Hindu, and was therefore greeted with just an invocation in place of the customary Vedic chants. He was then given offerings of fruits, flowers, and sacred ash. Sparkes accepted them with a gracious smile, making some polite inquiries.</p>

<p>“Are you well?" Sparkes asked. "I am very happy to be able to visit your town. Your people are very kind," and so forth. I acted as the interpreter.</p>
<p>One of them – an elderly Brahmin with a somewhat unctuous manner – kept speaking to the Sahib, grinning from ear to ear like the Cheshire Cat, nodding his head in extravagant gestures all through the ceremony. This is not an uncommon mannerism among some of our people when trying to show their goodwill, especially when poor.</p>
<p>"Is the Sahib well?" he went on speaking in Kannada. "I heard he came this morning in the mid-day sun. He must be careful about his health. As poet Kalidasa says about our ancient rulers, "jugopatmana matrastah…”</p>
<p>All this was Greek to Sparkes. He didn't understand what he heard and didn't like what he saw.</p>
<p>"Look at the bastard," he commented to me. "How he grins! One would think he was having fits. What is he trying to get off his chest now?"</p>
<p>It was fortunate that none of them knew English – very different from the situation today! Before I could respond, the Brahmin gentleman wanted to know what the Sahib was saying. I was more repelled by Sparkes’ comments than the poor fellow’s unctuous but well-intentioned inquiries.</p>
<p>"The Sahib says," I said making up an appropriate response, “‘we are happy, and grateful for your hospitality. This is a lovely town’. "</p>
<p>Sparkes watched our exchange with rising apprehension.</p>
<p>"What is it now?" he asked me in a whisper.</p>
<p>"He made a civil enquiry about your health and I gave him a suitable reply," I told him much to his relief.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you were translating what I said."</p>
<p>"Not literally."</p>
<p>"You are a sensible young fellow," he said, laughing a little sheepishly. "But don't ask me for a translator's job."</p>
<p>The next day, his horse had arrived and we rode out to visit some of the larger villages in the taluk. By now, our relationship had grown friendly. Also, he could see for himself that I was not one to seek massive doses of castor oil to escape riding. Later that evening, as we sat relaxing over a couple of drinks (for him), during the course of our conversation and also out of pure youthful vanity, I mentioned to him that I had represented my college in both cricket and football, was an accomplished wrestler, and a fair tennis player. I also boasted that I was a keen sportsman and had shot several leopards. He was impressed.</p>
<p>"I am charmed with you," he said as I saw him off at the taluk boundary. "And I wish you all the best. Sometimes I do get to see His Highness the Maharaja Sahib, you know – and will be sure to remember you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," I said. "But I hope you won't mention my having shot a leopard in the Irval residency. It's the Maharaja's private game preserve. I shot it without authorization. I had no business being there."</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>"Quite all right!" he said. "We shall say it died of 'other causes.' But now, let us be serious for a moment. You have got a difficult taluk – turbulent people, dishonest village servants, heavy arrears, and that sort of thing, you know. Do your best. I believe you, and I'll back you. I'll also speak to your SDO Devraj to give you all the support he can and not meddle with you. I should like to see you as assistant commissioner soon, working with me. Ta, ta – mention me to Tait when you write to him next." <strong>[Sic:</strong> SDO or the subdivision officer, the liaison between the Amildar and the DC, and nominally the former's superior in revenue matters, but with no executive authority. The Amildar was the chief executive of the taluk and reported directly to the DC. <strong>NSR] </strong></p>
<p>He squeezed my hand, and with a crack of his whip rode off at a canter. I watched him disappear down an eminence, and sent a thought of deep gratitude to Tait whose love and education had seen me through many a difficult situation. I felt his blessings would always be my protection.</p>
<p>For the better part of two years, Sparkes was my superior officer. Our relationship was enormously enjoyable – in fact, I don't recall a single instance of any difference or disagreement. He always went out his way to accommodate me. We never became close friends though. He was twice my age and had no intellectual interests, so we had little in common. But he did visit me whenever he could find the time. It must have been a lonely existence for Englishmen like Sparkes, so far from home and not knowing our language. He was a speck in history – an apparition from a vanished era. But he was also a good man who did his best to help people – to the extent of his limited ability.</p>
