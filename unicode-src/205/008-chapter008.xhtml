		<p><strong><em>Towns and villages in Old Mysore. The personality of Devarsay Gowda. His method of fund raising. His solution to problems with money lenders. His way with authority. </em></strong></p>
		<p>I next want to introduce one of the most remarkable men I have ever known, and the strongest personality in those parts at the time – Patel Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama. Patel is the chief of a village, a hereditary office. Devarsay Gowda was the Patel of an affluent and historic old village known as Saligrama. In those days, Mysore was over three-quarters rural; my taluk of Yedatore for instance had over sixty villages. Because of limited communications, towns and villages then used to be much more self sufficient than they are today. As a result, some village chiefs had grown to wield considerable influence and authority. One or two of them, through their force of character, initiative, and leadership qualities commanded the kind of recognition accorded to local chieftains a century ago. In my experience, the person who best exemplified the kind of stature that a Patel could attain to was Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama. It is my firm belief that had he been born a couple of centuries earlier, he would have been the founder of a ruling dynasty. As it was, he was like an uncrowned king in those parts.</p>
		<p>The fact that the Patel's office was hereditary had left Mysore society with an unusual feature. The Maharaja and the Patel, who occupied the highest and the lowest levels of authority in the realm, did so by hereditary right; all other officials were civil servants. Another key village official – the Shanbog – was also usually, but not always, a hereditary appointment. The Shanbog had the responsibility for maintaining the village accounts and also for tax records. The Patel of a village invariably came from the farming or the Vokkaliga caste, while the Shanbog was usually a Brahmin. Both men were considered leaders of the village community, with this important difference: the Shanbog was a professional bookkeeper, while the Patel, depending on his personal qualities, was often seen as a nobleman. And Patel Devarsay Gowda was most emphatically a nobleman.</p>
		<p>During my two years as Amildar of Yedatore, I saw a good deal of Devarsay Gowda. It has been nearly fifty years since I last set my eyes on the man, but his personality is as vivid in my memory as yesterday. There was nothing small about the man; his virtues – he had many – and his faults were equally on a grand scale. His generosity knew no bounds. He could never say ‘no’ to anyone who came to him for help, and that in the end was to prove his downfall. That is a different story that I am reserving for a later time. For the present, I just want to place him in the milieu in which I found him.</p>
		<p>The Kaveri flows in a west to east direction, bisecting Yedatore taluk in two. To the north of the river lie the affluent villages of Mirley, Saligrama, and Bhairya. These villages are the stronghold of the farming or the Vokkaliga caste, and many wealthy farmers used to live in them. Downstream from these villages, where the Hemavati flows into the Kaveri, lie several villages in which lived many Brahmins; some of them quite wealthy with large land holdings. In those days, Brahmins were influential in those parts. But the strongest personality in the whole region – among Brahmins and Vokkaligas alike – was Devarsay Gowda, Patel of Saligrama. And this owed nothing to wealth. He was neither rich nor poor. I knew landowners, traders, moneylenders, and others in places like Saligrama and Mirley who were ten times as rich. During the course of my career as a public official, it has fallen to my lot to be associated with important people in India as well as in Europe – with rulers, diplomats, political leaders, and captains of industry. But if wealth were measured in terms of commanding presence, personal magnetism, force of character and qualities of leadership – and not just material possessions – I can count on the fingers of one hand the persons I have known who could hold a candle to Devarsay Gowda of Saligrama.</p>
		<p>I knew him by reputation well before coming to Yedatore as Amildar. As the Patel of a town in my taluk charge, he was of course my subordinate; but his was a hereditary office, and his family had associations with the people of the area going back to times immemorial. No civil servant could hope to match his heritage. Whatever dignity the Amildar possessed was reflected glory – as the appointed representative of the Maharaja – and what he himself could command with his own qualities. To our people those days, how well a particular official upheld the proud history and traditions of the land meant much more than what procedures and rules he followed; to them he was a ruler first and foremost who embodied the Maharaja's trust and justice. An official who grasped this essential fact could make quite an impact. Patel Devarsay Gowda was a born leader, a ruler par excellence who fully embodied this essence, though his comprehension was elemental and intuitive rather than calculated.</p>
		<p>As I was about to take charge, I was warned that the Gowda's power and influence greatly exceeded his official position; that he was more a local chieftain than a subordinate official. He was reportedly a man who cared for no one. He was also said to have humiliated a previous high official – an Amildar no less – by parading him seated facing backwards on a donkey, decked in a crown, and garlands made from old shoes. I was warned to be on my guard. Naturally, I was curious to meet him.</p>
		<p>Actually, he paid me a visit in my office only the day after I took charge. He made a highly favorable first impression on me. He was a man of commanding presence, over six feet in height, which seemed even greater with the large turban that he was never seen without. He always had a dark gray or black shawl thrown around his shoulders. He was of powerful build with broad shoulders, but now in his senior years his body inclining to stoutness. His complexion was dark – almost black. He had fine large eyes that always looked you straight in the eye and a sharply chiseled aquiline nose over magnificent, sweeping, scimitar-shaped gray moustaches. A painter or a sculptor looking for a model for a Rajput warrior of yore or an epic hero need have looked no further than this aristocrat of the soil.</p>
		<p>His voice was deep and resonant, and he spoke the vigorous dialect of the yeomen of Old Mysore with the picturesque diction favored by the Vokkaliga caste to which he belonged. While he did not have much by the way of formal education, he had a natural way with words and spoke well. He greeted me with the respect due to my official position, but without a trace of obsequiousness – respect mixed with a certain fatherly regard – for the man was well into his sixties. As the descendant of a family used to leadership for generations, he had an unconscious and totally unaffected air of authority, and seemed by instinct to know how exactly to conduct himself in every situation – the trait of a born nobleman.</p>
		<p>Not many days after this meeting, I had occasion to learn personally of his leadership qualities and his way with people. His village of Saligrama had a problem with fresh water, especially during the dry season. A few years prior to my taking charge, Patel Devarsay Gowda had appealed to the Government through the then Amildar to sanction funds for a fresh water reservoir for his town. As proposed, this facility would draw water from the Kaveri canal, which would then be filtered to supply drinking water to the residents of Saligrama. The Government had approved the project, but required the town to come up with half the money, with the remainder to be provided by the state. It was estimated that Saligrama would first have to raise six thousand rupees on its own, with the Government then contributing an equal amount.</p>
		<p>Four years had passed since the Government had given its approval; in the meantime nothing had come of it. Despite taking personal charge of it, two previous Amildars had failed repeatedly in their attempts to coax the needed amount from the residents of Saligrama. Finally, the Government sent a reminder warning that the money set aside for the project had lapsed for the fourth straight year, and if Saligrama failed again to come up with its share of the funds, the Government would transfer its share to some other project where it might be put to better use.</p>
		<p>This was the situation when Devarsay Gowda and I discussed the matter. We had to find some way to raise the funds or lose the Government's contribution. He thought it over for a while and invited me to visit his town as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>"Come down to our place for a town meeting, my lord," he said. "I'll see what I can do."</p>
		<p>"What is the point" I asked, "in just coming to a town meeting and making futile appeals like all the previous Amildars? I don't see much use in coming if your people are not willing to foot their share of the bill. I'll come only if there is some chance of the money being raised."</p>

He spent some time in Saligrama before moving to the hill top seat of Melukote which was his final seat. He visited this modest temple there. The temple is still maintained by the descendants of the same family that took care of him during his stay in Saligrama.</em></figcaption>

		<p>"Sir," replied the Gowda, "in our town, there are wealthy Jain merchants, Shettys, rich Brahmins, and other land owners. I may be just a poor Gowda, but I am also the town Patel – your servant. You are the Maharaja's representative – our ruler. All you have to do is tell us, 'You bastards! You better do what I ask,’ and it will be done. Just come to Saligrama when you are free for a day, and I'll see what I can do."</p>
		<p>I was amused by his colorful language, but also impressed by his confidence, especially in light of the fact that two previous Amildars had failed dismally. I decided it was worth a try.</p>
		<p>A couple of weeks later, after Sparkes' visit, the revenue settlement, and some other work, I visited Saligrama. I had to finalize some of the town's revenue accounts also which meant I could attend to two tasks on a single visit. It was my first visit to Saligrama – a historic old village. More than a hundred persons had lined up in front of the Traveler's Bungalow to greet me. There were a few taluk and village clerks also present to help me with the revenue work. As soon as I crossed the town boundary, my trumpeters announced me with a couple of blasts, and the people came forward to receive me. I was on my horse and rode through the crowd in a procession like a bridegroom. The whole ceremony was a bit ridiculous, but it was the form expected in those days. Upon reaching the bungalow, I dismounted and occupied the seat prepared for me in the front veranda.</p>
		<p>I was received by the village elders – a Brahmin priest by name Chennappayana Krishnappa, the Jain Kubera Shetty, who was the chief of the town merchant guild, by Hanuma Gowda, a leader of the dominant Vokkaliga community, and of course Devarsay Gowda. Jains are a reform Hindu sect who in those days were mostly engaged in trade and money lending. Shetty or Setty is the caste title used by the merchant or the Vaishya caste, just as Gowda is used by Vokkaligas. The Vaishyas and Jains were the wealthiest communities in Mysore in those days.</p>
		<p>I greeted everyone using the proper form and ceremony expected in those days. I was then presented with a petition signed by hundreds of people. The petition, written by priest Krishnappa in flowery Kannada overflowing with learned Sanskrit words, touchingly described the plight of the town people and their need for fresh water. Then Krishnappa, in a Sanskrit verse of his own composition, compared me to Bhagiratha – the legendary hero of Hindu mythology who after many struggles finally succeeds in bringing the life-giving Ganges River from the Himalayan peaks to the plains of India. I then addressed the assembly.</p>
		<p>"This is your last chance," I told them. "For four years, the Government has offered you money for the project, but you have repeatedly failed to come up with your share. If you fail again, you may never get another chance in your lifetime. Your children and grandchildren will hold you responsible. Community leaders present here must set an example by making generous contributions – and show how much they care about their town and its people."</p>
		<p>I then said to the assembly that someone who was a wise and respected member the community should begin by opening a subscription list. The learned Brahmin Krishnappa was the natural choice and agreed. As soon as I finished my little speech, Patel Devarsay Gowda stood up, saluted the assembly with folded hands and spoke, in his simple yet dignified manner.</p>
		<p>"My lord!" he said, "I am a simple farmer. I have a large family and other dependents to feed. Enough food is cooked in my kitchen daily to feed thirty people. I have always lived honorably. This town is my heart and my soul. My family has served the people of this town for hundreds of years. We have been loyal servants of the Maharajas for generations. Mr. Krishnappa, sir, put me down for a contribution of five hundred rupees."</p>
		<p>As Krishnappa was about to begin the list by writing down the Patel's contribution, the Gowda spoke again."Sir," he said, "please don't put my name at the head of the list. That place belongs to you as a Brahmin and a teacher. You have taught everyone of us in this town— you are our Guru. You bathe, worship, and pray in the temple every day for our welfare. You have need for water more than any of us. Then there are business community leaders – Mr. Kubera Shetty, Bagarajiah, Adirajiah, and others. My name should follow theirs. They will all make generous contributions I'm sure. And Mr. Hanuma Gowda here – a fellow Gowda like me – is a wealthy man. He'll give at least a thousand— when a small farmer like me has given five hundred. Am I not right, Mr. Hanumaiah?"</p>
		<p>Hanuma Gowda seemed embarrassed by this appeal.</p>
		<p>"How is that possible sir?" he protested. "You are our chief and the leader of our community. How can I go one better and donate a thousand. Please put me also down for five hundred."</p>
		<p>Hanuma Gowda's demeanor as he announced his contribution gave every indication that he was parting with that kind of money for the first time in his life. Krishnappa gave a thousand, and the Jain and other merchants present each gave five hundred rupees if I remember correctly; a few may have given more. Within a few hours, just from this group of village leaders, we had collected nearly all the money necessary. This was an extraordinarily impressive performance of persuasion by Devarsay Gowda, considering that two previous Amildars had failed to make any headway.</p>
		<p>I was especially struck by the willingness of the Jain merchants to support the project, for they had a well-deserved reputation for being notoriously tightfisted. Even though many of them owned land, their principal vocation and source of income was money lending at exorbitant rates of interest. What land they did own was acquired through foreclosures of mortgaged property from delinquent owners. As a result, these merchants did not work their land, but hired landless laborers of the Vokkaliga caste as tenant farmers. So, these moneylenders were not exactly public-spirited men known for their concern for the well being of their fellow citizens. I felt that there must have been some other reason lurking behind their uncharacteristic generosity. With a few discreet enquiries I learnt how Devarsay Gowda had managed to bring them around and gain their support. Here is the story.</p>
		<p>These Jain merchants owned hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands around Saligrama, irrigated by the Kaveri canal. Not being farmers themselves, they leased their lands to tenant farmers, some of whom were former owners who had lost title to their lands to these merchants through foreclosures. A few years before I came to Yedatore as Amildar – in the year 1903 I believe – crops had failed due to a drought causing the canal to run dry, blight, or some other reason. This resulted in a severe shortfall in what the cultivators could pay their owners. Naturally, they requested a postponement. The owners refused. Devarsay Gowda, as the Patel and also as the leader of the Vokkaliga community to which nearly all these cultivators belonged, tried to persuade the owners to compromise on payments pointing out that the condition had been brought on by a natural disaster. He even agreed to stand personal surety for the farmers until the situation could be restored following a normal harvest. The crop failure had been so severe that even if the farmers were to hand over everything they had grown, they would still be short of their contract obligations. But these rapacious owners who knew nothing about farming refused any compromise, and wanted the farmers to sell their family jewels and other personal belongings to meet their contract payments. This was too much for the Gowda. He decided to break the owners' arrogance once and for all.</p>
		<p>Devarsay Gowda saw that the most effective way of dealing with these merchants was to exploit their weakness – their complete lack of any farming skills. But first he had to take care of the farmers in distress. He found employment for as many of the dispossessed farmers as he could on his own and his kinsmen's lands. He then visited other landowners in the taluk – both fellow Vokkaligas and Brahmins – to provide temporary employment for these cultivators. The high regard in which the Gowda was held, combined with the universal distaste for the moneylenders and their methods, made his task easy. He also appealed to the Government to start some public works projects, and again persuaded his wealthy friends to bid for contracts and employ the remaining farmers. Within a few months, most of the dispossessed farmers had been taken care of.</p>
		<p>Moneylenders are never popular anywhere, and these men deserved all the odium that was heaped on them. Devarsay Gowda found the existing situation, with moneylenders in ownership of the farms also highly unsatisfactory and decided the only way of improving the lot of the farmers was to break their grip on the farm economy once and for all. He went to the owners and told them that all their tenant farmers had found alternate employment, and that their own lands would be left fallow. This was only the beginning. He then told them that he had enough influence with the people in the area, as well as with the Government to ensure that no one would cultivate their lands for as long as necessary to make them see reason.</p>
		<p>These moneylenders were now in desperate straits. They had all this land they didn't know how to work, and also the tax bills, capital equipment, seed, manure, farm animals, land and canal use and maintenance fees and a hundred other chores that come with land ownership, all adding up to a huge drain on their resources. And without farmers to borrow money, their main source of income – money lending – was also severely hit. They soon threw in the towel and agreed to terms highly advantageous to the farmers. They agreed to a much lower share of the crop on four-year contracts, with clauses for crop failures.</p>
		<p>Ever after this brush with disaster, they treated Devarsay Gowda with utmost respect and took care to be on the right side of him. The memory of this was still fresh in their minds and explained their willingness to follow the Gowda's lead. Even though he was respectful towards these merchants in the public meeting, it would not surprise me if the Gowda had met with them beforehand in private for some gentle arm twisting. The remarkable thing in the whole episode is the Gowda’s concern for the people, he asked nothing for himself.</p>
		<p>I don't recall now what became of the project; the money we had raised was handed over to the Government, but the bureaucracy moved at its own pace. Nothing had been done in the following two years when I was Amildar of Yedatore. It must have been completed later, for I hear that Saligrama now has excellent water supply. And the citizens of that fair town can thank their great Patel whose leadership and intelligence made it possible.</p>
		<p>During the two years and a half that I had to deal with him, my experience as his Amildar left me ambivalent about Devarsay Gowda. He was obviously an exceptionally able and resourceful leader. Also, whenever called upon, he served me with intelligence and diligence. He was also very useful to me in a famous jewel robbery investigation that I will relate in the next chapter. He was courageous, loyal, highly intelligent and an outstanding leader who could always be trusted to help those in distress. At the same time, people kept cautioning me that the man was something of a law unto himself who stopped at nothing – that he was often involved in crimes and used his power and influence to intimidate witnesses in the courts. At first I assumed that these were only rumors spread by persons envious of his talent and influence. There was certainly a good deal of that, but the charges against him, though exaggerated, were not without substance.</p>
		<p>Over a period of time, I began to see that his qualities were mixed. If there was one thing that characterized Devarsay Gowda, it was loyalty; loyalty to those who acknowledged his leadership would be given unquestioningly, regardless of consequences. His infinite capacity to overlook any flaw or action on the part of any of his dependents was probably the dominant trait in his character. This was compounded by an overweening vanity that led him at times to place himself above the law. He was proud of his ability to protect the interests of those he regarded his followers, no matter what. And if he happened to regard someone as an enemy, that man would be destroyed. It was at least what a lot of people believed and warned me about.</p>
		<p>The problem with Devarsay Gowda was that he was a throwback to an earlier heroic age now forced to operate in an arena that was too constricting in scope for a man of his talent and temperament. It must also have been irksome for a man of his talents and aristocratic instincts to be subordinate to every civil servant, most of whom he regarded with justice as mediocrities.</p>
		<p>He was reputed to have under him a band of a dozen or so men as his personal bodyguards prepared to undertake any assignment. These men were said to intimidate town merchants and buy whatever they pleased on credit, making payments as and when they pleased. It was also believed that Devarsay Gowda could help resolve any dispute or win a fight anywhere in the area by sending his men to the party requesting his aid. Many villagers firmly believed that if they wanted anything done by the Government, having Devarsay Gowda on their side was the best way of getting it done.</p>
		<p>Much of this was hearsay; if he managed to get things in the Government it was because he was able and intelligent, and was held in high regard by the authorities. But there were things I had heard that could not be easily overlooked. I heard of instances in which the Gowda was said to have taken the side of defendants in government lawsuits, and had actually succeeded in having the cases dismissed by silencing government witnesses through intimidation. These charges, if true, were clear violations of the law; as Patel he worked for the Government and it was his duty to uphold and enforce the law of the land. After receiving this intelligence, I decided to have a frank talk with him, even though I didn't have any evidence against him. I sent for him to see me and first briefed him about the charges.</p>
		<p>"It is highly improper for you," I warned him, "to come in the way of the law. And you – as a highly respected leader – should be especially concerned about the kind of example you are setting for others."</p>
		<p>"But my lord!" he protested. "These are nothing but rumors and innuendo. A man like me will always have enemies, and some of them are bent on destroying me. Because they have no facts, they have resorted to character assassination. I have never broken any law anytime in my life."</p>
		<p>He was almost in tears as he protested his innocence – all in all giving a very convincing performance. I was persuaded that he was telling the truth.</p>
		<p>A few weeks later, there was a case involving a Vokkaliga youth that had been charged with chasing another youth into his house and assaulting him. As the case was about to be heard in my court, Devarsay Gowda came to see me and said, "My lord, this boy is my nephew. You must save him."</p>
		<p>"If he is one of your relatives," I replied, "you should have taken better care of him – seeing to it that he didn't break the law. The case is now in court. My decision will be based on evidence and the law. Not on personal recommendations."</p>
		<p>In another case involving a land dispute, some men had been charged with forcing themselves upon the property and severely beating the owner; they were said to be set upon by Devarsay Gowda to go to the aid of one of the parties. The case was tried before me, and a famous lawyer was brought from Mysore to represent them. In his closing argument, the lawyer dropped a broad hint to the effect that his clients were honorable men known to Patel Devarsay Gowda. Those present in the audience gave me an expectant look, trying to read my reaction. Ignoring the remark, I read my judgment awarding a fairly stiff sentence, pointedly noting that the evidence against the accused men was very strong.</p>
		<p>As the case was being tried, I began to receive a stream of anonymous petitions about my involvement in the case. The theme and thrust of these letters was unusual – a combination of seemingly wellintentioned advice and veiled threats. They went something like this:</p>
		<p>"Sir, you are a good man with a bright future ahead of you. You have a wife and small children to take care of. Please don't act hastily. This taluk is a den of thieves. These people will think nothing of humiliating you in public. They once paraded a taluk official tied to a donkey and decked in old shoes. They won't hesitate for a moment to use force against you if they think it will serve their purpose. Your life may be in danger."</p>
		<p>Some other letters contained direct threats – with no pretense of any goodwill. They gave a graphic description of what sort of fate might be in store for me should I choose to provoke these people with my arrogance of power. These also mentioned crowns and garlands of shoes, donkey rides, threats of injury, and worse.</p>
		<p>This was too much. The style and language of the letters suggested a single source for both kinds of letters. I sensed that Patel Devarsay Gowda must have a hand in the whole thing, and decided that I would sooner or later have to confront him. There was never the slightest doubt about the rightness of my course of action. To allow myself to be swayed by them would be an act of cowardice and a betrayal of myself and the Government whose law I was sworn to uphold. I wanted an opportunity to make it clear to the Gowda and anyone else that may have been involved, that my resolve was firm and they could never hope to bend me to serve their needs.</p>
		<p>At the same time, I treated their threats seriously and took some precautionary steps. With the help of the police I prepared a list of all those individuals reputed to belong to the band of Devarsay Gowda's henchmen. I also instituted the following measures for my personal security. I would always carry a loaded revolver and never go anywhere on foot in public without a bodyguard – my orderly Sheikh Mohaddin and a couple of taluk servants. Whenever I went for a walk, it was always in the company of some friends. I really did not believe I was in any physical danger; I also felt that with all the precautions I had taken, I was fully capable of defending myself. In fact, in the confidence of youth, I even looked forward to a challenge.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, a complaint had been lodged against a man from Saligrama known as Pataki, which in Kannada means ‘firecracker’. His real name I believe was Boray Gowda and he was reputed to be one of Devarsay Gowda's men. He was a son of Hanuma Gowda – the wealthy landowner of Saligrama whom we have already met. In spite of being born into a respectable family, this Pataki liked to associate with undesirable characters. He had been charged with creating a disturbance at the santhe by assaulting someone repeatedly with a shoe. The victim was a son-in-law or some other relative of Devarsay Gowda, but for some reason the two families had become estranged. I saw the victim, and the sores and bruises on his body left no doubt that he had received a severe beating. In this tangled web of animosities, it was unclear where exactly Devarsay Gowda stood.</p>
		<p>As I was about to begin hearings in this case, the same pattern of threatening letters was repeated, except their tone seemed to be more ominous. A highly respected farmer from Mirley paid me a visit and cautioned me about the potential risks. He advised me to transfer the case to a different court pointing out that I was in a no-win situation: I would be criticized if he were let off, but place myself in danger if I found him guilty. I asked him how he knew about the dangers. He said that people were openly talking about it, and in fact, he was there to warn me at the behest of several of my well-wishers concerned for my safety. I thanked him, but told him that it had only strengthened my resolve to act in a manner worthy of their affection.</p>
		<p>The case came up for hearing. A team of well-known lawyers from Mysore came and defended the accused. But the prosecution was able to establish Pataki's guilt and I sentenced him to three months of hard labor. After the sentencing, as I was coming out of the court, I caught sight of Devarsay Gowda as he was about to disappear around a corner. I called out his name and invited him to accompany me to the Traveler's Bungalow. I decided this was as good a time as any to have a frank talk with him. I still had no evidence against him; all I had were my suspicions. The best way of dealing with him, I felt, was to be completely frank. The Patel's own pride and sense of honor would never allow him to be evasive. He must also have been curious, and possibly, also a little apprehensive. His face was covered with sweat.</p>
		<p>I had also sent for the inspector who remained at a respectful distance. I invited the Gowda to take a seat. He seated himself on a chair looking quite uncomfortable. Making sure that no one else was within earshot, I spoke to him.</p>
		<p>"I have reviewed the anonymous petitions that you and your people have been sending me," I told him. "What purpose do you think they will ever serve? Like you – I too am a servant of the Maharaja, and I serve him without fear or favor. If I do my sworn duty faithfully, there is a God in heaven who'll take care of me. Besides, I always carry a loaded revolver – just to be sure. Six men must drop before anyone can lay a hand on me. I have heard of your exploits – of humiliating an Amildar with donkey rides and garlands of shoes. If that is to be my reward for faithfully executing my sworn duties, I'll consider it an honor. But mark this – if anything should happen to me, I have left enough records on you and your men to destroy everyone of you. I have left instructions so that everything that has transpired will be sent to the Government. This time, I am just cautioning you because you were kind enough to warn me. But if I find evidence of any of your men breaking the law, you can expect me to prosecute them most vigorously. Sir, if you do not mend your ways, it is only a matter of time before you get caught. You are from a distinguished family. You have lived well all your life – but you could end your days in prison."</p>
		<p>Devarsay Gowda heard this with some consternation. He then stood up, spoke to me with folded hands – politely, but with the air of one who had been unfairly treated.</p>
		<p>"Sir, I do not know who wrote all those anonymous letters," said the Gowda. "But I can assure I would never do such a thing. In these parts, people invoke my name in all sorts of things without ever telling me. Am I to be blamed for every act that ruffians of this town perpetrate? Judge me by what I do, but don't be influenced by everything you hear about me. If you find any evidence of wrongdoing, punish me all you want, but don't be swayed by rumors. There's nothing I can do about them."</p>
		<p>Although I was not totally convinced that he had no hand in those letters, I felt his argument was reasonable. I also began to suspect that he probably did not have as much control over the conduct of his men as people believed. At the very least he could be depended upon to convey my warning to his men, I felt. Still, I felt I owed him an explanation for our meeting. In an attempt to be conciliatory, I stood up and put an arm on his shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Mr. Gowda, sir," I told him, "I bear you no ill-will, I assure you. On the other hand, I have great respect and even admiration for your qualities. But it disturbs me to see so much disorderliness and open contempt for the law. This taluk has a bad reputation. Leaders like you must assist servants of the land like me in upholding the Maharaja's law."</p>
		<p>He gave his assurance and left. For the remainder of my stay in Yedatore as Amildar, Devarsay Gowda was extraordinarily helpful to me, helping me in several cases. My impression now is that lax administration by previous taluk officials had undermined the rule of law allowing local leaders to fill the resulting power vacuum. Then just before I was to leave Yedatore for another taluk, I myself had to arrest Devarsay Gowda in a dramatic riot and murder case, famous in those days (1907) as the Bidirakka Riot. It is a story that I have reserved for a later time.</p>
