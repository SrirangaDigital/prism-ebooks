		<p><strong><em>A wedding night jewel robbery. An encounter with Tandrey Linga. Tracing the stolen jewels. Inspector Khan Saheb.</em></strong></p>
		<p>Just a few months after taking charge as Amildar, I moved my residence from Yedatore to Hampapur, about two miles away. Hampapur, being on high ground, was free of the swamps and swarms of mosquitoes that plagued Yedatore. One day, at about five in the morning, I heard a woman wailing piteously just outside our house. My wife went up to the window to see who it was.</p>
		<p>“Some poor woman is outside our house, crying her heart out,” she came back and said to me. “Do come and see what the problem is.”</p>
		<p>“Who are you? What is the problem?” my wife then asked the woman. “What can we do for you?”</p>
		<p>“I am Subbamma, “the woman replied. “I have come to ask the Subedar for his help.”</p>
		<p>My wife turned to me and said, “The poor lady is Krishnappa’s wife Subbamma. You remember we went to their daughter’s wedding yesterday. It looks like she is in some serious trouble.”</p>
		<p>My wife lit the lamps and opened the door, let the lady into the house and said, “Subbamma, what is the problem? Don’t be afraid. Yes, my husband is here.”</p>
		<p>I wrapped a shawl around my shoulders and came into the guestroom to investigate. Subbamma was a Sanketi <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-009-01">1 </a></sup>woman of about thirty-five. Her normally pleasant face had been ravaged by grief. I knew her husband, a moderately well-off Brahmin, who made his living out of some land he owned, supplemented by the fees for the services he performed as a priest. He was a simple harmless soul, who kept to himself and his books. I wondered what could have brought on this grief to his family, and that too just the day after their daughter’s wedding. I asked her what the matter was. She gave the following account.</p>
		<p>“We just celebrated the wedding of our daughter, our only child to the best of our ability. We are not rich, but my daughter, like all young girls, wanted to dress up for the occasion. So we borrowed some jewelry and fine clothes from some friends and relatives for her to wear. It was nearly midnight when the festivities ended, and my daughter was exhausted and ready to go to bed. She complained that all the jewels and the heavy, gold-braided silk sari she was wearing were making her very tired. We told her to be a little patient, and at about one-thirty we removed her sari and the jewelry off of her, put them in a cane basket, and placed it on a wooden chair in a room where four or five of us women were to sleep. The men were sleeping in the hall outside, and we shut the door. We had no reason to be suspicions. We were so exhausted, that we fell asleep in no time at all, though the men outside kept on talking for quite some time. We were fast asleep until awakened by the usual morning trumpet blast from the temple.</p>
		<p>“When I woke up, I saw to my horror that the jewelry basket was gone. I was alarmed and burst out crying aloud. People came running, asking me what the matter was. They soon started arguing saying, ‘How could a thief enter a house full of people? You must have misplaced it somewhere. Try to remember where exactly you put the jewels,’ and so on. In the meantime, my brother had informed the police and the inspector came with a sergeant, and a writer.”</p>
		<p>“By then it seemed the whole town had collected in front of our house. The people who had loaned us the jewelry also came. They began to whisper among themselves and finally a few of them came and said to me, ‘Look, Subbamma! We are not wealthy people. We loaned it to you in good faith. You should try and remember where exactly you put them and return them to us. Why bring in the police, the courts and all that? Just tell us where you kept the jewels.’</p>
		<p>“And the rest seemed to agree with them. I almost collapsed! I realized that they suspected we were putting on a performance just to keep the jewelry to ourselves.</p>
		<p>“I didn’t know what to do. We’re poor, but honorable people. I didn’t think my husband would survive this humiliation. I felt like killing myself by jumping into the Kaveri. But what about our daughter Gowri? Then my husband, who seldom speaks to me in front of other people, came up to me, handed me a cloth, and said, ‘Don’t cry. God came to Draupadi’s rescue. He won’t abandon us.’</p>
		<p>“He then turned to the people gathered there and said, ‘We are paying for some sins in our previous lives. But don’t for a moment suppose – even in your dreams – that we will do away with the gold and jewels you loaned us so trustingly. I will sell every single thing I have and repay your loan. I say this before the Lord Arkeswara, in whose temple I worship.’</p>
		<p>The police drove away all the people and began to question us. They made a list of stolen things together with the names of the owners. They searched the house from top to bottom, even the kitchen and the room in which we perform the daily worship. They then whispered to themselves in Urdu [the inspector and a constable were both Muslims] and said to me, ‘Very clever! If all of what you say is true, who could have come in here and stolen the jewelry? Now, why don’t you just tell us what you did with the stuff?’</p>
		<p>“This was terrible. I thought to myself, ‘What if this man is a Muslim, and I am a Brahmin? This is not the time to worry about these things.” I saluted him with folded hands and said to him, ‘In all truth, I really don’t know what happened. These people are my relatives. They are all good people.’ The inspector said, ‘Yes, we know. Your brother is a truthful fellow. We will make him talk,’ and took him to the station. The look my brother gave me made my heart burn, and makes me wonder why I am still alive. But what would happen to my husband and daughter if I were kill myself by drowning in the river?</p>
		<p>“Then I thought, ‘The Subedar is a Brahmin, not a heartless man like that Muslim police inspector. He is a good and wise man, and I’ll go and ask him to save me and my family from this disgrace. I’ll tell him he should think of me as his sister, and he will believe me when I say that in God’s truth, I am not a liar and a thief’.”</p>
		<p>“The police don’t know that I’m here,” she concluded.</p>
		<p>She was too overcome and began to cry. My wife was greatly moved by the story and tried to comfort her. “Please compose yourself. You have nothing to worry about. There is God in heaven to protect helpless women. Sit down. My husband will find out what happened.”</p>
		<p>So, my wife had decided for me that I should take personal charge of the case! It was also according to the rules, as any case involving more than five hundred or thousand rupees, I don’t remember which, was called a ‘heinous’ offence, and the law required the Amildar to take personal charge of it. Besides, why be reticent: I was also concerned that this gentle, unworldly couple might get rough treatment by the police. I got my ox-cart yoked and ready and asked her to get in. I followed her on my horse as we made our way to her house, which was in Yedatore about two miles away.</p>
		<p>There was large a crowd in front of their house. I could hear a whole range of opinions being expressed. “Just see how cunning these Brahmins are! It is a scheme to keep the jewelry to themselves,” said one, while some others said, “They are such good people. Why did this have to happen to them?” and “Krishnappa is a God-like person. The whole plan must have been hatched between his wife and her brother.”</p>
		<p>I went into the house. The people present there stood up as I entered, and someone brought me a chair. I presided over the meeting, asking questions. The inspector came to me and whispered, “Sir, this Brahmin priest is a simpleton. He is not the sort to be mixed up in such business. It is his wife, and her brother. My sergeant Nanja is a very clever fellow. He interrogated him. These two must have got together and engineered the whole thing.”</p>
		<p>I just nodded. The inspector then said, “This is a heinous case. The law says you should sign the F.I.R. [first investigation report] yourself. The investigation must also go on in your name as taluk chief. That is the procedure for heinous cases. But we’ll do all the work. You need only give us the authorization and stand by us.”</p>
		<p>The inspector was able and experienced, but I had never before done a police investigation of this kind. My knowledge of detective work came from reading Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, which were then popular, and the few minor criminal cases tried in my courts during my magisterial duties. Yet, in my youthful enthusiasm, I had high hopes of solving this case by myself with the inspector’s help. I was also motivated by pity for the poor woman who had come crying to me, and her unfortunate family, for I was convinced they were innocent victims. Her words, “The Subedar is a kind and wise man. I’ll ask his help,” and my wife’s firm faith that I would solve the case decided me. I sent the F.I.R. and also released her brother Venkataramaiah from the ‘lock-up’ on the condition he was not to leave town. I took inventory of the stolen goods and estimated that they were worth about 3,500 rupees, an enormous sum in those days.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-009-02">2 </a></sup>I also got this estimate certified by a committee of town worthies known as the panchayat.</p>
		<p>What next? I had to somehow improvise. I got my helpers to draw up a plan of the house and explored every corner of it using a magnifying glass – a la Sherlock Holmes. It led to nothing. I sent the list of stolen goods to all the police stations in the area, and also gave secret instructions to keep a close eye on the movements of all the known criminals in the area, with orders to report to me any recent unusual activity on their part. I also sent instructions to keep an eye on any large transactions at any of the goldsmiths or jewelry shops.</p>
		<p>This seemed to bear fruit. At first I first received reports that all of the known regular criminal personalities – Ramalinga, Pataki, Shamba, and others were in their villages, none having shown any recent signs of unusual activity or new ventures. But soon I also got a report that a notorious thief called Tandrey Linga had left his home village a couple of months or so ago, and his present whereabouts were unknown. For two weeks, I received nothing more of him and the trail seemed to have gone cold. Then a report from the police outpost in a village called Bhairya came with the information that “A known felon by name Tandrey Linga was involved in a fracas at the village fair and beat up a few people. He has been arrested and kept in police custody for questioning.”</p>
		<p>This man, a felon famous in those parts, was a native of a small village called Tandrey, where he had a farm and a house. He hardly ever lived there, his house being shut up most of the time. His land was left fallow, overgrown with weeds and scrub bushes. Once, while visiting this village, I asked the Patel why Linga never farmed his land.</p>
		<p>“Why should he work my lord?” he replied. “When he has his life of crime for his milch cow?”</p>
		<p>“What about the tax on his property?”</p>
		<p>“The tax is paid up my lord,” the Patel told me. “We usually end up paying it.”</p>
		<p>Later, I learnt the truth from the village Shanbog. Tandrey Linga was no ordinary thief, but a local godfather. If he took a dislike for any man, that poor man’s livestock died mysteriously, and fires appeared in his barn. Besides, in the colorful language of the Bhairya police sergeant, Linga was a ‘Rangucora’ meaning he was violence prone, whom, even a few prison terms had failed to reform.</p>
		<p>The story of his first imprisonment is extraordinary, and gives an idea of his daring and opportunism. It happened thus. There was a young supervisor in the Public Works Department or ‘sub-overseer’ as he was then known, living in Yedatore. He was recently married to a very beautiful girl and they were an affectionate couple. One day, as he was leaving for work he said to his wife, “The Director of Public Works (DPW) is coming to inspect the new extension. He will be camping at the site there today. I may have to stay there for the night, but I’ll try to come back. I can leave early again tomorrow on my bicycle and be there at the site on time.”</p>
		<p>“Don’t tire yourself too much” she told him.</p>
		<p>“I’ll probably be late,” he replied. “There is no need to wait up for me. Just leave the front door unlocked. I’ll let myself in.”</p>
		<p>Tandrey Linga, who happened to be nearby happened to overhear this conversation. His nimble mind sensed an opportunity. He followed the young supervisor to the place where the extension work was being done. He mixed with the people who were there to see the DPW Sahib at the Traveler’s Bungalow. He soon learnt that the Sahib had invited his subordinates to dine with him, and estimated that the sub-overseer would not be able to leave before eleven at the earliest. This, Linga thought, would give him enough time to carry out a plan he had hatched. Linga returned to Yedatore immediately.</p>
		<p>Taluk villages are typically quiet by nine or so. In those days before electricity came to the villages, there were only some kerosene lamps in the streets that were too dim to do much more than show up the darkness. I have been out at that time to check on the diligence of the beat policeman. Whenever I went early, the police would tell me that they had not yet started their beat; if I went later, they would claim they just left to report at the police station. Once in a while, when I encountered a policeman on his beat, he would pretend that he had not seen me, and create such a frightful din with his whistle and his stick, that it made me feel thankful for my vocation – Subedar and not a thief.</p>
		<p>To return to the main story, Tandrey Linga came back to the village and went straight to the sub-overseer’s house. As he had anticipated, the door was not locked and he entered the house. He saw the man’s wife sleeping, in the light of a small oil lamp set on a wooden bench. He saw that she was wearing a gold necklace and some bangles also of gold. He reflected on his course. Fortunately, he was only a robber and not a morally depraved man. He did not think either of killing her or molesting her, but only wanted her jewelry. He gagged her with the bedcover, and overpowering the woman, took away her jewelry. Once his job was done, he made a dash for the door. This, of course, took a few minutes.</p>
		<p>The activity and the muffled screams of the victim set the street dogs barking. As he came out of the house, he collided head on with a man trying to come in through the door. This man fell on Linga and forced him to the ground. As Linga was struggling to free himself the woman came out, threw her blanket – the same one that the thief had used to overpower her – on both the men, and roused the neighborhood with her cries. The neighbors came in and apprehended Linga. The sub-overseer had asked the Sahib’s permission to leave immediately after dinner, returning an hour earlier than what Linga had calculated. This, and the resourcefulness of the brave woman, had upset Linga’s plan and led to his arrest.</p>
		<p>My first meeting with Tandrey Linga is also etched in my memory, but first I need to give you a little background. Saligrama is a prosperous village in Yedatore taluk, and used to be a centre of trade and money lending business in those days. As a result government mail runners covering the postal route often carried hundreds of rupees in their mailbags from money orders originating in Saligrama. A section of this route, running from Saligrama to Arkalgood, had to pass through a valley that was deserted much of the time. Postal carriers often had to negotiate this stretch at night. There was some other traffic also, carrying goods and money. Numerous thefts and robberies along this road had given it a bad name. As Linga’s village Tandrey lay just on the side of this route, it was thought that he was the ringleader of a band of thieves, and controlled these activities. The taluk, the district, and even the Diwan’s office, began to receive anonymous letters alerting that Linga was hatching a plan to loot the postal runners’ bags, and even the revenue couriers who had to negotiate this route. As this road lay in my taluk, it fell to my charge to take every precaution to forestall Linga’s depredations. So, I made every effort to keep a vigilant eye on him, but he managed to elude efforts by the police to meet him.</p>
		<p>This was what led to my first meeting with Linga, which came about as follows. One day, shortly after taking charge of the taluk, I stopped at Tandrey on the way to Saligrama from Anakanahalli, hoping to surprise him. I went up to the Patel and asked him if Linga was in town.</p>
		<p>“Yes, that is his house,” the Patel said to me, pointing to a small house. “That woman there is his wife.”</p>
		<p>I went up to the woman and asked her where I could find Linga. She told me that he was in the field. I wondered what on earth he was doing in the field, when he had his vocation of crime as his gold mine. I rode on, accompanied by the Patel and a few others. The Patel pointed to a man bent over, working in the field, and said, “My lord, that’s Linga.”</p>
		<p>“Mr. Linga!” he next shouted at the man. “Our lord, the Subedar wishes to speak to you.”</p>
		<p>The man didn’t even stand up to greet me as was expected in those days, when receiving a king’s official. Without even looking up, he said, “I have nothing to say to the Amildar. I see no reason come to him. Let him come here if he wants to talk to me.”</p>
		<p>In the face of this calculated insult, I felt I had to be firm with the man and said, “Hey, Linga! You b---, come here.”</p>
		<p>He straightened up. Physically he was not all that impressive. He was a lanky man of sinewy build, suggesting an alert quickness rather than strength. With an insolent grin he retorted, “Who are you to talk to me like that? If you are the Subedar, punish me when I break the law. For now, I’ve no business with you.”</p>
		<p>He continued looking at me with his insolent expression and a small scythe in his hand. He was clearly showing off in front of the Patel and other villagers who were already in fear of him. I felt that if I let a notorious felon like this get away with such behavior, I would never be able to command any respect in this unruly taluk, and the Government’s authority would be undermined. If I were to swallow this humiliation in public view of the Patel and other villagers, they would be justified in believing that I, like the rest them, lived in fear of Linga.</p>
		<p>I was then a strong young man, and always carried a loaded revolver in my pocket. I resolved to break his insolence. I rode up to him, and gave him a couple of lashes with my horsewhip, saying, “Take that for your insolence.”</p>
		<p>He grabbed the bridle of my horse with his left hand and raised his scythe with his right hand, as if to strike me. I don’t know if he intended to strike me or was just trying to scare me, but I gave him no time to act. I pulled the revolver out of my pocket, aimed it at his arm and shouted, “Drop your weapon, or I’ll blow your arm off.”</p>
		<p>The Patel and the other men started shouting, asking him to drop his weapon. He dropped it immediately. As I recall now, the revolver hammer was not cocked, but they had no way of knowing it. I gave him another thrashing, and sent him over to the police station with my orderly, the Patel and an armed guard. There he was interrogated about the allegations. By this time, the readers will have recognized that Tandrey Linga was no ordinary thief.</p>
		<p>Now returning to the wedding night jewel robbery, I already mentioned that Tandrey Linga had been picked up by the police in Bhairya for creating a public disturbance. As soon as the news of Linga’s arrival in Bhairya reached me, I visited the place and made casual inquiries about his movements. The manager of the village choultry <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-009-03">3 </a></sup>gave me the following account.</p>
		<p>“Tandrey Linga came here at noon,” he told me, “and asked for lunch. There was no food in the kitchen. He grumbled that all provisions went to feed the choultry’s Brahmin staff, and there was nothing left for visitors like him. I told him, ‘Look, I can give you some provisions, so you can cook a meal for yourself.’ He refused saying, ‘No, thank you. Eat it yourself, and may it all turn into gold in your stomach.’ He then went to the Patel’s house and said to him, ‘I have been away from home for three months. I just came back— walking all the way from Atthiguppe in the hot morning sun. Can you provide some food for me?’ He ate at the Patel’s house and took his leave.”</p>
		<p>The Patel confirmed the choultry manager’s account. The story aroused my suspicion. It looked as though Linga had gone to all this trouble mainly to establish that he had come back to Bhairya just that day, after being away for three months. Obviously, the idea was for him to be able to claim that he was far away from Yedatore on the day of the robbery. As I noted earlier, his unruly conduct at the village fair had led to his being taken to the police station, where he had to sign papers to gain his release. This also seemed to me like part of a contrived plan— to give himself an alibi. If my guess was correct, he must have been at some place in the neighborhood on the day of the crime, well before his claimed arrival, which he went such lengths to draw attention to.</p>
		<p>The crime had take place in Yedatore, a short distance from Bhairya. If Linga was our man, he could have gone to Mysore the night of the crime to dispose of his stolen goods; or he might have gone to Saligrama, where too there were facilities for their disposal. On second thought, it struck me that Saligrama was the more likely venue, as Linga was bound to have better contacts there, being a local. He might even have returned to his home in Tandrey, deciding to wait it out for a few weeks until the furor had died down and then get rid of the jewels. This meant he must have made the trip from Yedatore to Tandrey soon after the crime.</p>
		<p>There were two possible routes from Yedatore to Tandrey. The first crossed the Kaveri over the Yedatore bridge and passed through Hampapur, Mirley, and Ankanahalli. The second, much less frequented, followed the southern bank of the Kaveri to Chunchan Katte. This road had no bridge, and the river had to be crossed near Chunchan Katte. Except for a short period in the dry season, this crossing could only be done in a boat or a canoe. Despite this handicap, as well as the bad condition of the road, this less frequented route would have appealed to someone like Linga.</p>
					<figure>

				<figcaption><em>Rapids at Chunchana Katte near where Linga had to cross the Kaveri River. Now there is a bridge.</em></figcaption>
			</figure>	
		<p>This route ran through almost uninhabited country that was totally deserted at night. The first road on the other hand was a busy thoroughfare, and ran by a large wholesale depot right by the bridge, which was guarded at all hours of the day and night. Hampapur lay at the far end of the bridge where I had my own house, at the entrance to the town. Just a few miles out lay Mirley with a police outpost, also situated directly on the road. Linga was a notorious figure and there were many including policemen who knew him by sight. This was the worst possible route for a known felon carrying stolen goods to be taking. It seemed to me, that unless he was a fool, he was bound to have taken the second, more deserted route.</p>
		<p>I was still unable to fathom how Linga had managed to break into Krishnappa’s house that night, find his way through so many guests sleeping in the hallway to the inner room where the women were sleeping, and then make his escape with the goods. I did remember his daring break-in when the sub-overseer was away, but then the house had a single sleeping woman. The wedding night robbery was a totally different proposition. The only possibility seemed to be the presence of an accomplice among the wedding guests. This man and Linga must have been acquainted with each other for a long time. Having the run of the house, he must have seized an opportune moment when everyone else was asleep, and passed on the jewels to Linga, probably by throwing it out of a convenient window.</p>
		<p>No matter what his method, according to my theory, Linga must have crossed the river by boat at a small village called Chikkanayakana Halli on the night of the crime or very early the following morning. There was no other place within miles where he could get a boat. (The Chunchana Katte rapids made crossing virtually impossible at any other place. See photo.) This gave me something to get started. I decided to visit the place and make discreet inquiries of the boatmen who lived there. I also had an excellent assistant, my police inspector.</p>
		<p>The inspector, a Muslim officer by name Khaja Mohammed Khan, was a past master at mixing with people and getting information without attracting undue attention. After all these years, I have yet to meet a more capable police officer. He spoke the corrupt Kannada dialect of the Mysorean Muslims of those days: the sounds s, sh, shh – all had the same value in his speech; he would dash away whatever came first to him, both in speech and in writing. I am speaking of course of the early years of this century, and it is no longer true. A great many Muslims speak perfect Kannada today, and many of them have attained distinction as writers. There were far fewer educated Muslims then, and their manner of speech was as I just depicted. His reports also were not distinguished by their literary quality, but were full of sound judgment and good sense based on years of experience. He was an honest and friendly man of impeccable character.</p>
		<p>The inspector and I went to Chunchan Katte to investigate if Tandrey Linga had taken this route following the crime. At first we met with disappointment, for no one remembered having seen him recently. This was about a month or so after the theft, so not altogether surprising. There are no hamlets between Yedatore and Chunchan Katte, and I was certain that Linga would have made the journey under the cover of night. Then the inspector talked to the boatmen at the crossing and had better luck. One of them, their leader, knew Tandrey Linga quite well; in fact, they were friends. When asked about when he last saw Linga, he replied, “How do I know sir? Am I a reading man to keep records? It might have been fifteen or twenty days: may be a month. Yes sir, it was more like a month.”</p>
		<p>The inspector brought back his account, which I reproduce below pretty much in the ferryman’s own words.</p>
		<p>“On that day, very early in the morning, I was washing myself in the river when Linga called me by name and waved at me. I rowed my canoe across to him and said, ‘You are certainly out very early sir.’ He said, ‘Yes, I had to start early. I have some very important work at home. Be a good fellow and keep your mouth shut. Just ferry me across the river.’ As we were about halfway across the river he asked me, ‘Is Appaji in town?’ ‘How should I know?’ I asked back. When we reached the opposite bank, I asked him for the fare. He pulled out a silver rupee coin and asked me if I had change. ‘When do I carry change on me at this time?’ He said, ‘That’s all right! Keep the change. Don’t ever let on to anyone I was here. If you are good, I’ll give you a large reward at the next jatra in Chunchan Katte.’ But I cannot keep this from lordships like you. You want to know if he had anything with him – nothing. No, wait! I remember now. He had something wrapped in a towel, say, a bundle the size of a pumpkin. No, he didn’t put it down. He held it in his hands all the time. How should I know if it was heavy? I didn’t touch it.”</p>
		<p>(This means Linga and the boatman crossed the river from north-tosouth, landing on the right bank of the Kaveri. Yedatore is on the left bank as the name indicates – yeda in Kannada meaning left.)</p>
		<p>The man Appaji whose whereabouts Linga was interested in, was the village goldsmith. (Of Chunchan Katte village that is.) He had served a three-month jail term for his part in a case involving theft. But it was a long time ago, and he had apparently reformed. He was now practicing his profession in a perfectly legal way, as a law-abiding citizen. From what the boatman and some other villagers told us, he seemed to be acquainted with Linga. The inspector surmised that the two men must have met in prison and kept up their friendship, recognizing their mutual interests.</p>
		<p>The inspector had Appaji brought over to the police station in Chunchan Katte. He spent the night at the station. I have no recollection of his conversation with the police but I was more concerned about alarming Linga.</p>
		<p>“As soon as Linga hears that we are interrogating Appaji,” I told the inspector, “he will take fright and make himself scarce. I want you to arrest him as soon as you can find him.”</p>
		<p>The inspector sent several policemen and a sergeant to Tandrey by the river route. The following morning, the inspector sent the goldsmith to traveler’s Bungalow where I was camped. The jeweler Appaji gave me the following account:</p>
		<p>“Tandrey Linga is known to me. We are not exactly chums, but he comes to my shop whenever he needs any job done: any job that is related to my profession, having to do with jewelry and gold. I have made bracelets and a waistband for his wife. I have made other jewelry for some of his other women friends also. Linga is something of a ladies’ man. One morning, about twenty days or so ago, he came to my house looking extremely tired, as if he had been traveling all night. I asked, ‘What brings you here?’</p>
		<p>He said ‘I’ll tell you, but first get me some coconuts, peanuts, fruit, milk, and sugar’, and gave me a rupee.</p>
		<p>‘There are some Shaivayats in town. Shall I ask them to prepare some sweetmeats for you? I can ask them to cook a meal for you if you want.’</p>
		<p>‘No thanks. There is no time for all that. I haven’t the time for a feast. I want you to do a job for me. I hope you are alone in the house. Where is your wife?’</p>
		<p>‘She has gone to Saligrama, visiting her sister. I am alone.’</p>
		<p>‘So much the better! I want you to melt down some jewels and make me a gold ingot.’</p>
		<p>‘You know very well Mr. Linga! I don’t do such things.’</p>
		<p>‘Oh! I know you very well. Don’t waste any more time. Be quick about it.’</p>
		<p>After this, what could I do? He was sitting right there in front of me, eating the fruit and the nuts I had just brought him and kept pushing me. I knew I couldn’t get rid of him unless I did as told. I lit the furnace and got my blowpipe ready. Then I asked him, ‘What have you got there?’</p>
		<p>He opened the bundle he was carrying and spread the towel in his hand and took out two bangles and an armlet, and handed them to me. I reached for the scale to weigh them, but Linga stopped me.</p>
		<p>‘There’s no need to weigh them. I’ll be watching you.’</p>
		<p>I estimate that the jewelry he handed to me to be melted had about eighteen or twenty tolas of gold. Now you know everything I know.”</p>
		<p>I didn’t think so. Appaji was clearly holding something back.</p>
		<p>“You say he took them out of the bundle and handed them to you to be melted down,” I told him. “There must have been other objects in that bundle. You must have seen them.”</p>
		<p>At first, he claimed he saw nothing. I told him it was impossible going by his own account. After some persuasion accompanied by a few veiled threats, he finally let out.</p>
		<p>“That is true my lord!” he said with a sigh. “I saw nose studs, a necklace, a pendant, earrings, and a hair brooch in the bundle.”</p>
		<p>It was clear that the trained eye of the jeweler had missed few details. It was also the first independent account of the missing jewelry. “I said to Linga,” Appaji continued, “‘You bastard! You’ve had a field day hunting.’ ‘Yes, but I’ll end up as the trophy if I get caught. Just do as you are told’.”</p>
		<p>“I then hammered the jewelry he gave me into two ingots – spherical in shape like balls, one slightly smaller than the other. In my rush, a drop of gold came loose and hardened into a ball of about half a tola. Linga told me to keep it in lieu of payment. That sir, is the full story.”</p>
		<p>“Do you still have that piece of gold with you, the one that Linga gave you?” the inspector asked him.</p>
		<p>Appaji answered he did.</p>
		<p>“You said there were other women in his life,” the inspector asked him again. Can you name any?”</p>
		<p>After much pressing he revealed the name of a prostitute in Saligrama. I will call her Kempi as I cannot now recall her name.</p>
		<p>The same day, the inspector, accompanied by a few village elders as witnesses, escorted Appaji back to his house and recovered the piece of gold given to him by Linga. He also had it appraised before witnesses and took custody of it. This was the first tangible piece of evidence we had in the case, and sufficient to arrest Linga. Also the same day, Linga was picked up in Tandrey where he was home feigning illness. He was brought to the police station in Saligrama and kept in custody in the lock-up.</p>
		<p>We still had a long way to go. Out of the three-and-a-half to four thousand rupees worth of jewelry, we had recovered a miniscule quantity of gold. What was encouraging was that the jewelry described by Appaji as having seen in Linga’s possession matched our list of stolen jewelry. But where was the rest of it? Also, what was Linga’s modus operandi? There was little doubt in our minds that Linga had engineered the robbery, but we had two major tasks still ahead of us: recovery of the stolen goods, and gathering enough evidence for Linga’s conviction. The next day I went to Saligrama to investigate the matter further.</p>
		<p>The inspector made a routine investigation based on the few clues we already had. He located the prostitute Kempi, and recovered from her the gold braided silk sari, which had also been missing. We recognized it as the same one that had covered the basket in which the jewels had been placed on the night of the crime. Kempi confirmed that Linga had given her the sari. The poor woman, frightened out of her wits by all this, gave us also the names of several of Linga’s intimates. One of them was Lachmey Gowda, a nephew of Devarsay Gowda, the Patel of Saligrama. The inspector interrogated some of these men.</p>
		<p>These men told the inspector that on the day after the crime, Linga was hiding in Kempi’s house, and passed the time feasting and playing cards with some of his friends. He had been to Tandrey before coming to Saligrama, and his wife had also visited him a few times in Saligrama. Linga was certainly spending money on a lavish scale. We surmised that by now he must have sold one, or possibly both of the gold ingots that Appaji had prepared for him. All our efforts to discover the party to whom he had sold them proved fruitless.</p>
		<p>We next went to his house in Tandrey to talk to his wife. She was a wily woman. She put on an impressive performance – playing an indignant virtuous woman helplessly trying to reform her wayward husband. She was alternately crying and pleading that her husband should be sentenced to a long prison term. “A felon’s wife is always a widow,” she kept saying. We searched the house thoroughly and found nothing except the usual household effects. The inspector was not taken in by her histrionics and described her to me as a 'cunning slut'. We both felt that she was fully involved in the crime as her husband’s accomplice.</p>
		<p>Linga remained in police custody. I should tell you that even in custody Linga remained defiant and arrogant and treated the police with supercilious disdain. Unlike most thieves, who are basically simple and humble by nature, Linga affected a superior attitude. The police completely struck out in trying to get Linga to co-operate with them. When I tried to talk to him, he said, “Why don’t you go ahead and hang me? Just don’t leave me in the hands of the police to be tortured.”</p>
		<p>“We know that you stole the gold,” I told him. “Just tell us who worked with you, and where the rest of it is now.”</p>
		<p>“Ask Appaji, or ask Kempi,” he laughed, “they are the ones who claim to have seen the stuff.”</p>
		<p>Obviously he was no fool and knew about courts and rules of evidence.</p>
		<p>“Sir, let me tell you something,” he said addressing me. “Ten seasoned felons are no match for one wily police inspector. Ask your own inspector if I am wrong about this. I feel sorry for you. You are still very young – just a puppet in the hands of the police.”</p>
		<p>“Why don’t you just come clean with the truth,” the inspector told him. “We already have enough evidence to convict you. You will spend four or five years in prison. And you could well die in prison and let someone else enjoy your gold.”</p>
		<p>“I didn’t do it. I don’t care who gets the gold, but I didn’t do it,” he protested to the inspector. “It is strange Sahib, that you should be telling me this. You keep persecuting poor men like me so you can draw your pension. Why, you could also die before you qualify for your pension. Have you thought of that?”</p>
