		<p><strong><em>The Dussera celebration. A contest of strength with an Iranian wrestler. Official and domestic disputes. </em></strong></p>
		<p>In a book like this one, it is impossible to relate events in a strictly chronological order. For example, my efforts to apprehend the Abboor assassins were spread over a period of two years, but I had to relate them all in a single place, treating it as a single episode. There were other episodes, not so connected, yet not without human interest, helping to shed light on the daily lives and practices of our people in those days. I will describe a few of them in this chapter.</p>
		<p>A notable event in the kingdom was the celebration of the ten-day Dussera festival in October, during which His Highness the Maharaja held the annual durbar in the central palace in Mysore. All government officials in Mysore at the time were required to attend it. Also in attendance would be invited guests from all over the country as well as the British representatives attached to the Mysore kingdom. It was a joyous occasion celebrated with great pomp and pageantry. The durbar would be held in the balcony of the Mysore palace, with the Maharaja in full royal regalia, shining like Indra in the assembly of Gods.</p>
		<p>Thousands of subjects would gather to catch a glimpse of their divinely anointed king. Then on the tenth day, known as ‘Vijayadashami’,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-01">1 </a></sup>he would come down and receive the people’s acclamation, mount his royal elephant for the final procession that would take him to the sacred banni tree for the ceremonial cutting of its branch that marked the end of the celebration. This practice went back to the 14th century to the rulers of the Vijaynagar Empire (founded in 1336). The kingdom of Mysore, founded by Yadu Raya Wodeyar in 1399, seems to have adopted the practice. The Wodeyar rulers of Mysore ruled first as one of the feudatories of the Vijayanagar Empire, and later as the successor kingdom. They had adopted and continued many of the traditions and practices of Vijayanagar.</p>
		<p>Wherever they may be, Mysoreans fondly remember Vijayadashami with emotion, observing traditional practices displaying their piety and showing their devotion to their king. Some years ago, the Mysore Yuvaraj happened to be in London during the time of the Dussera festival on some official business. On Vijayadashami day, he invited all the Mysoreans living in London and described to them the Dussera celebration and its significance. People who attended his party later told me that the Yuvaraj was almost moved to tears on the occasion.</p>
		<p>During my service in the Government, and also later in my years of retirement, I have attended the durbar many, many times. I hope the description that I just gave will help those who never witnessed the Dussera celebration to get a glimpse of it; to those who have seen it, it will probably seem flat. I cannot recreate in words the enchantment of the old capital or the magical atmosphere of the celebration.</p>

		<p>I brought up this subject because this celebration was enacted in every taluk in the kingdom. In each taluk, the Amildar as the king’s representative would hold a mini-durbar in the taluk office. The place would suitably be prepared for the occasion, decorated with flowers, boughs, and bouquets. A large chair would be set up in the Amildar’s court with a large state flag – with the Mysore royal insignia of the double eagle – draped on the wall forming the background, together with a portrait or statue of the Maharaja. The taluk officials and other leaders would be invited to the durbar with the Amildar presiding over the ceremony. School children would put on simple acts, musicians would give performances, and there would also be wrestling matches. Finally, there would be a parade of policemen and officers before the assembled guests. The assembly would then rise to its feet, salute the Maharaja’s portrait, and march amidst cheers to the local banni tree led by the Amildar. The Amildar, in his capacity as the Maharaja’s representative, would perform the ceremony of cutting a twig from the tree, marking the completion of the Dussera festival. Services would be held in all the temples and free food and offerings distributed to the devotees at state expense.</p>
		<p>On such occasions, I tried to mix freely with people, setting aside my official position as their chief. At first, the people found it strange and felt uncomfortable to see me in their midst but soon began to enjoy my company.</p>
		<p>Within my limited capacity as a taluk chief, I tried to help artists. Whenever a musician of note happened to be in the area, I would inform interested people and arrange a recital. It is a matter of great pride to me that it was in Yedatore when I was Amildar, that the genius of Vasudev Achar was first recognized and encouraged, well before he attained his present fame as one of the greatest of our musicians and composers. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-02">2 </a></sup>I still remember his singing of Tyagaraja’s composition ‘Rama ni Samana Vemaru’ in the Kharaharapriya raga, in the Chunchan Katte Sri Rama Temple (better known as Kodandarama Temple). I have heard other great artists sing the same work, but never have I been so moved as I was on that occasion. I am prepared to believe that the magical experience of the Dussera festival and the proximity of divinity cast a spell on us making our senses more receptive to the gentle strains of the music.</p>
		<img src="images/0035.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>In addition to classical music, I also used to attend more popular musical fare offered at Lingayat religious gatherings. I used to get invited to folk dramas that combined singing and dancing with plays based on themes from history and mythology. (Known as Yakshagana) It is one of the glories of folk art. I loved these performances and tried to attend them if at all possible.</p>
		<p>As a student in Mysore I had learnt wrestling and had won prizes in a few local events. Promising young wrestlers would be asked by their teachers to perform before me. I showed them some holds and techniques used by wrestlers in the Punjab. These extra curricular activities had made me popular with this class of people. As a result I could get hundreds of volunteers whenever I was involved in any task requiring physical courage, though one would be justified in wondering why on earth an Amildar needed any physical skill. For the most part he didn’t, but there were a few exceptions. I remember an incident where some physical effort was needed on my part. It happened as follows.</p>
		<p>I happened to be in the town of Bhairya during the village fair where a large crowd had gathered for shopping and bartering. A small group of touring Iranian traders had camped in a field near the police station.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-03">3 </a></sup>For reasons known only to them, they went around the gathering needlessly offending people. It soon led to some heated exchanges between the villagers and the visitors. Finally, one of the Iranians who fancied himself a strong man drew attention to himself, twirled his moustache, and announced, “I throw a challenge to this village. Let your best man come and wrestle with me, or else, send your women to us.”</p>
		<p>The result was uproar. I rushed to the spot to investigate. I saw the potential danger in the situation and decided that something had to be done on the spot. The Iranian braggart who issued the challenge didn’t look all that formidable; they all looked physically more imposing than they really were because of their exotic clothes and massive head dresses.</p>
		<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself – behaving like a boor with people offering you hospitality?” I said to him, speaking severely in Urdu. “Who do you think you are? Some sort of a modern day Rustum, or a stud bull? I could kick bastards like you myself this minute, but you are too revolting for me to lay a hand on. So, let’s see how strong you are? Let’s see you do this.”</p>
		<p>I picked up the police jemadar’s bicycle by the horizontal bar, lifted it off the ground grasping it in my right hand with the arm fully extended. This takes quite a bit of strength in the biceps and the forearm; but strength alone is not enough. One needs also proper balance and muscle co-ordination. It calls for a combination of strength and proper technique that comes only with practice.</p>
		<p>“Show me you can do this before you talk any more.”</p>
		<p>He tried it a few times. He had neither the strength nor the technique needed to bring it off; the moment he tried to extend his arm, it would collapse. A few of his comrades also tried but failed. A few of them may have been stronger than me but they lacked the technique needed for this particular exercise. The crowd cheered me.</p>
		<p>“Your boy is a fool,” I told the leader of the Iranians. “What he said to the villagers is unforgivable. He must apologize for it. As strangers in our country it is stupid of you to offend your hosts. If you don’t behave you’ll get in trouble.”</p>
		<p>The youngster apologized to the villagers and they went about their business. They sold some knives and other cutlery and bought eggs and produce.</p>
		<p>By the time I returned to Yedatore, this little story had reached home, embellished to a degree that amazed and embarrassed me. The story claimed that I had single-handedly fought with this youth, and two others, and defeated them all! Then, they attacked me en masse, when I had to defend myself by grabbing a policeman’s lathi and drive them away! My wife had already heard this tale and seemed quite upset by it.</p>
		<p>“All that education is wasted on you,” she chided me. “What made you get in with a crowd of foreign Turks <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-04">4 </a></sup>and vagabonds? Are you a scholar or a brawler? If you want recognition as a wrestler, why don’t you at least perform before the Maharaja and ask him for promotion?”</p>
		<p>“There was no wrestling match,” I told her, “Only a small weightlifting contest.” She calmed down. But I knew that for all her show of anger, she was really proud of my physical strength and athletic skills.</p>
		<p>There were other incidents that were more serious in nature, one of which brought me into conflict with my own subdivision officer (SDO). My SDO was Chikka Devaraj Urs of the Dalwai family.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-05">5 </a></sup>Sparkes was still deputy commissioner (DC) and as I have already related, he had given me a free hand in the taluk administration, telling the SDO not to interfere in my taluk. SDO Devaraj Urs was a good-natured man with the manners and bearing reflecting his aristocratic lineage, but not too diligent in his duties. He had high regard for me, but this was compounded by some resentment because of my excellent standing with Sparkes and Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs. The episode that aggravated our relationship came about as follows.</p>
		<p>Hadya is a riverside village, which in those days was a stronghold of the Lingayat community. Some Vokkaliga farmers also used to live there. After all these years I don’t recall the names too well, so I can only outline the incident. There was a dispute over one of the Vokkaliga farmer’s land. He had been married twice. The first wife had a son who had only recently been married to a woman whom I will call Honnamma (not her real name). The farmer died, and within a month of his death, his son – Honnamma’s husband – also died. The girl and her step mother-in-law did not get along too well. So Honnamma, finding little support in Hadya, went back to live with her father in Mysore. In her absence, a prosperous man known as a Gurukar – a minor Lingayat religious figure – managed to gain influence over the older woman and had the two widowed women’s property transferred in his name. Immediately thereafter, he also attempted to take possession of these valuable irrigated lands along with their standing crops. When the news of this reached Mysore, Honnamma’s father consulted a lawyer who advised him to proceed at once to Hadya with his daughter and claim her rights.</p>
		<p>Upon reaching Hadya, Honnamma’s father lodged a complaint with the police. He said the property rightfully belonged to his daughter, and the Gurukar had illegally occupied it. He also complained that the crops ready for harvest lawfully belonged to his daughter, but her life might be in danger if she tried harvesting it. The police told him that this was a civil dispute – a matter for the civil courts – that lay outside their jurisdiction. Unwisely, without waiting to obtain a court order, Honnamma and her father attempted to harvest the crop. The Gurukar had them forcibly evicted with the help of hired thugs. Both had been severely beaten and the poor woman had also been humiliated by being stripped of her sari. The two then filed assault charges against the Gurukar and the assailants. The Gurukar was also accused of having forcibly carried off the harvested grain. This was the situation when the case came up for hearing in my court.</p>
		<p>In their court petition, Honnamma and her father had included medical certificates about their injuries from a doctor in Yedatore. I had the assailants arrested immediately. I also sent the petition for a preliminary police investigation and they brought back a formal charge sheet with a security warrant for the Gurukar, and summons for the witnesses. I then received news that the Gurukar had absconded. I postponed the hearing and announced that one of the offences that he had been charged with was not bailable, and issued a new warrant for the Gurukar to be held without bail.</p>
		<p>I heard reports that this man had friends among the servants or some other followers of the noble houses of Mysore. On the strength of this connection, he managed to obtain an interview with my SDO Devaraj Urs, giving him a highly distorted version of the episode. The essence of his complaint was that I, in my youthful arrogance had overstepped my bounds in trying to arrest a man of his status. He also implied that because I was a Brahmin, I bore a natural ill-will towards his Lingayat caste. A vivid description of Honnamma’s beauty was also somehow made part of his complaint.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-06">6 </a></sup>He begged my SDO to save him from my wrath. All this, I heard from DC Sparkes; I’ll next relate what was my own experience.</p>
		<p>As the case was going on, the SDO Devaraj Urs, quite unexpectedly sent word to me that he was in my taluk, camping in Chunchan Katte. Chunchan Katte is only six miles from Hadya where the incident had taken place. I went and joined him in camp. Each of us was occupying a room in the traveler’s Bungalow. That evening, the local police officer came to me and reported that the Gurukar was in the SDO’s office. The SDO, though nominally Amildar’s superior in revenue matters, had no executive authority; my superior in matters relating to law enforcement was Sparkes, the DC. The police also reported directly to me as Amildar; the SDO had no jurisdiction over them. Upon receiving news of the Gurukar’s visit, at first I did nothing. Within a short time, the SDO sent for me. As I went into his room, I saw the Gurukar was already there. He stood up and saluted me as I entered.</p>
		<p>“What is all this I hear from this gentleman?” the SDO asked me. “Is it true that some scoundrels have filed some foul charges against him?”</p>
		<p>“If there are charges pending, the case has to be heard in court,” I replied. “It would not be proper for me to talk about the case. You will have to excuse me.”</p>
		<p>“I know this gentleman,” the SDO persisted. “He is a highly respectable man. He has a banking business running into thousands of rupees.”</p>
		<p>“I see,” I replied calmly. “Can you please tell me why you sent for me?”</p>
		<p>“I sent for you so that I could tell you about it. It is your duty to safeguard the honor of respectable people...”</p>
		<p>“It is my sworn duty as an official of the Maharaja to safeguard the honor and safety of each and every subject in my charge, big or small,” I retorted. “I enforce the king’s law and the king’s justice to the best of my ability and without prejudice or favor. Now, with your permission I shall take your leave.”</p>
		<p>I knew that what I said was a bit self-righteous and even pompous, but the SDO left me little choice. I felt my anger rising when I saw my own SDO trying to get me to show special consideration in a case, basing his views on unfounded tales about me; and all this by summoning me in the presence of the very man who had been charged! I told the house police officer to arrest the Gurukar as soon as he left the SDO’s room. We already had the warrant ready.</p>
		<p>A few minutes later, the Gurukar left the bungalow and alighted his cart on his way to Hadya. Before he could reach the town boundary, the police Jemadar served the arrest warrant and brought the man back to the station. His relatives came running to the SDO and reported that the Gurukar had been taken into custody. In the meantime, the SDO must have reflected upon our recent exchange.</p>
		<p>“This concerns a case now in the courts,” he told the relatives. “Engage a lawyer and get his release from the Amildar’s court. I cannot interfere in this matter.”</p>
		<p>Devaraj Urs and I never discussed this case again. Though we remained outwardly cordial, our friendship was at an end.</p>
		<p>But this was not the end of the story. The Gurukar’s lawyer submitted a bail application and I released him on bail. His party then tried very hard to have the case transferred out of my court. In his transfer application the lawyer stated that I was personally ill-disposed towards his client, having been unduly influenced by tales carried by his enemies bent on ruining him. This, the lawyer claimed, would make it impossible for the accused to get a fair trial in my court. The application came to me for my comments. I wrote back commenting that the complaints were groundless, but the case could by all means be transferred.</p>
		<p>The district magistrate – DC Sparkes Sahib – came to Yedatore during that time. The Gurukar and his lawyer met the DC and confided their concerns to him personally. Sparkes stopped by my office and asked me privately about the complaints.</p>
		<p>“What, Amildar?” Sparkes asked me with a smile. “Is it true what they say? That you personally dislike the man?”</p>
		<p>Sparkes always addressed me as Amildar, never by my name.</p>
		<p>“Sir, I bear no man such love or hatred as to let injustice be done from the seat of justice,” I replied. “I hate no man so much as to punish an innocent, or love anyone so much to acquit one proven guilty. But I have already said I have no objection to having the case transferred to another court.”</p>
		<p>“I have seen the charges,” Sparkes continued, “they are serious and could lead to stiff sentences if proved.”</p>
		<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>
		<p>“Suppose I were to lessen the sentences – when they appeal your ruling in my court. That would weaken the authority of the Government</p>
		<p>– would it not?”</p>
		<p>“No question about that! Under those circumstances it would be best to transfer me to another place. It’ll mean hardship for our people to live under a weakened rule.”</p>
		<p>“Don’t worry,” he assured me. “Do what you feel is right.”</p>
		<p>I was not transferred; neither was the case. Sparkes backed me and the case was heard in my court. The Gurukar’s lawyers tried very hard to provoke me to make me lose my temper and react in an undignified manner. In doing this the lawyers felt they could claim mistrial and have the case transferred. I found their efforts more amusing than offensive. I remember a funny occasion when I turned tables on one of the lawyers. This lawyer came late one afternoon for the hearing. He requested permission to complete his argument the same day saying he had to leave for Mysore the same evening.</p>
		<p>“By all means,” I told him, “but I have an engagement to play tennis at five with some friends from out of town. Please finish your argument by then.”</p>
		<p>He agreed, but in the flow of eloquence he lost track of time. I stopped him and said, “It is past five now, time for me to leave. I’ll give you fifteen more minutes. You must finish by then.”</p>
		<p>He requested fifteen more minutes after that, but by then he had still not finished arguing. I got up and started to go towards the door. He kept on talking with his face turned towards me, which forced him to walk backwards towards the entrance. Had I not warned him as we reached the door, he would have toppled over backwards as there were about half a dozen or so steps from the door to the courtyard. I reached the tennis court that was adjacent to the court house. He still followed me arguing the case.</p>
		<p>“Sir,” I finally told him, “you seem a little confused about the function of our courts. This is a tennis court. Cases are not heard here. We already left that place.”</p>
		<p>In the ensuing battle between his anger and the mirth of the assembled people, laughter carried the day.</p>
		<p>I ruled on the case a few days later and gave the Gurukar a suspended sentence because of his advanced age. As I now recall, I handed out some fairly stiff sentences to the men involved in foul play – especially to those who had assaulted the woman.</p>
		<p>If the Amildar had the trust of the people, even family disputes would sometimes be brought to him for advice and resolution. I will relate one of those cases, which had some points of interest.</p>
		<p>One morning, in the town of Chunchan Katte, I was about to mount my horse for my morning rounds, when a young man came running to me wailing loudly, and threw himself at my feet. I lifted him up and asked him what his problem was.</p>
		<p>“My lord! My home is ruined,” he cried. “I borrowed money to pay the bridal fee for my marriage. Now my wife has run off with another man, taking all the jewelry, fine clothes, and the money I had saved to pay off the creditors. If you don’t do something, I have no choice but to kill myself.”</p>
		<p>He gave himself up to his grief.</p>
		<p>He was a tall, well-built man of about twenty-five. His face and features were distorted by his weeping and fatigue, but I could see that he was a good-looking young man. Though I felt some sympathy for his state, I also found such unrestrained display of grief somewhat repelling.</p>
		<p>“I am very distressed to hear this,” I said to him, “but there is nothing we can do about it. You must file a report with the police. We will then investigate the matter further.”</p>
		<p>“My lord, I can catch them,” he said. “They are in the temple just outside the town. I can bring them to you. You must set things right for me.”</p>
		<p>“Well, if you know where they are,” I asked, “why don’t you deal with them yourself?”</p>
		<p>He then gave the following story, telling me that his home was in a village near Periyapatna, the name of which I cannot now recall.</p>
		<p>“The other day my wife left for the santhe but didn’t return home as usual. I inquired some people who were at the same santhe. One of them said to me, ‘You fool! You think she will come back to you – that girl. She has run off with a man with a lot more money – with that fellow Mari Shetty’. I was told that the two of them had gone to Bettadpur. When we – my uncle and I – went to Bettadpur, we were told that they left for Hosur; in Hosur, they told us we would find them in Chunchan Katte. Here in Chunchan Katte – just last night – we found them hiding in the riverside temple just outside the town.”</p>
		<p>“What did you do with them?” I asked with some concern.</p>
		<p>“I wanted to finish both of them off right there and then,” he replied. “But my uncle stopped me saying, ‘What do you think will become of you if you kill them? The police will hang you for it.’ He then left me there to keep watch so they didn’t get away, and brought in the Patel. They are now in the Patel’s custody.”</p>
		<p>I silently thanked his wise uncle. But for his good sense and presence of mind, what was a domestic dispute might have turned into a major tragedy involving murder. I sent two policemen with the man to bring his wife and her companion. I gave instructions that they were to be held in my office until I had a chance to meet with them personally. When I returned from my rounds, the husband, the wife, the other man, and the uncle were all there, in the company of the two policemen and other village workers including the Patel.</p>
		<p>His wife was a young woman of about twenty. She was a very attractive girl with a fine figure, dark complexion, lovely features – a picture of health and youthful vigor. I could detect no sign of vice or wantonness in her. Her aspect indicated a resigned acceptance of what she had done and indifference to the consequences. I felt sorry for her; she seemed like a gullible sort who had fallen prey to the wiles of an unscrupulous man. It didn’t seem right to me that her life should be ruined for her one rash, misguided, act. It brought to my mind the words of poet Hood,</p>
		<p>“One more unfortunate...”</p>
		<p>The man who had seduced her with his display of wealth was no Manmatha; neither was he a Bhima of power and majesty, but a middle-aged man of about forty-five, with a body worn threadbare by a combination of nature and his own depraved lifestyle. He had an emaciated look with sunken cheeks and a sullen, mournful, expression.</p>
		<p>At the moment he looked frightened, casting agitated glances all around the room like a caged animal. But I felt that he was fully capable of turning familiar and impertinent given the least chance.</p>
		<p>I opened the inquiry. The husband repeated his complaint. His account varied somewhat from what he had given me in the morning – his losses had more than doubled – and the jewelry and the fine clothes he claimed she had made-off with now rivaled the crown jewels in splendor. His wife watched his performance with amazement that gradually turned into amusement.</p>
		<p>“You have heard him,” I said to her, after the man had finished the story. “What do you have to say?”</p>
		<p>“My lord! Do you think I am so fortunate as to have seen the jewelry and finery he described? If I had enough food to eat and clothes to wear— would I have done what I did?” She burst into tears as she spoke.</p>
		<p>“Don’t cry,” I said to her. “Let’s suppose there was no gold or silver. But is it right to leave your husband because he is poor?”</p>
		<p>“What sort of husband is he? I have to keep working all day long in other people’s homes. And when I come home he doesn’t say a word to me,” she continued crying.</p>
		<p>“All right! You say that he is not good enough for you”, I said feigning anger, “and you ran away with this emaciated old dog. Did you find him to be a prince or a warrior? Is he going to marry you? Will he at least look after you to the end of your days?”</p>
		<p>“There’s nothing to choose. I was a loser both ways.” She again wept as she spoke.</p>
		<p>I then turned to her seducer and asked him to explain his conduct. He then gave me an utterly revolting and self-serving account of his behavior, full of sly and obsequious gestures. He was not a native Kannada speaker, and spoke a corrupt form of the language that he had picked up in the streets.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-014-07">7 </a></sup></p>
		<p>“What is there regarding the character of women,” he intoned, “that a man of your vast knowledge needs to learn from an insignificant person like me? This abominable woman hounded me at every chance, pursuing me at every santhe in the village. I am a respectable family man, but she – a witch – cast a spell over me and had me in her clutches. She kept pestering me, ‘Take me away! I like you very much.’ I tried reasoning with her, ‘Good woman, your life is with your husband. You have to be faithful to him, or perhaps not. If you decide not, where is the need to run away? You’ll break your husband’s heart.' Even after this sound advice she would not leave me well alone. She threatened to commit suicide by jumping into a well or by poisoning herself. Then she said she would turn into a ghost and haunt me in spirit. I thought, ‘O God! What am I getting into?’ I tried avoiding her, but this shameless slut would not let me alone. Am I not made of flesh and blood, sir? After all, when Gods and sages have succumbed to the wiles of women, how about a poor mortal like me? But as I said, I am a completely blameless and honorable man dragged into this by this vile woman.”</p>
		<p>He was a city bred man. He had put on this utterly revolting show of alternate groveling and shamelessness in an attempt to persuade me that his looks and polish had proved irresistible to the poor girl. In fact, I found it so repulsive that I enlivened his performance with a few juicy lashes of my horsewhip. I called in the inspector and told him to investigate the matter carefully, and, if possible, settle their dispute and save their marriage. I sent for the Patel and an assembly of village elders to meet with the police and come up with a decision. I then went into my office.</p>
		<p>A couple of hours later, the inspector and the assembly of elders came into my office and said, “We have come to a decision. We’ll act upon it if you agree.”</p>
		<p>“What is your decision?” I asked.</p>
		<p>The inspector requested Mallappa, the chief of the assembly, to speak. Mallappa, a village elder was a dignified man of impressive bearing.</p>
		<p>“The man admits that he was wrong to seduce another man’s wife with false promises,” said Mallappa. “He has agreed to pay the wronged husband a hundred rupees in retribution. The wife has been a good woman who claims that her chastity has not been violated. This is confirmed by her seducer.”</p>
		<p>I thought I detected the merest hint of a smile on the face this worthy village elder as he said this, but it may have been my imagination.</p>
		<p>“The husband has agreed to take his wife back,” Mallappa continued, “and she in turn has given the assurance that she will live respectably as his wife. If this meets with the approval of your lordship, we’ll consider the matter settled.”</p>
		<p>The arrangement was agreeable to all parties. The husband asked me if I could find some unused government land that he and his wife could farm, their present jobs being dead ends. As I recall, I gave an introduction to my friend the Amildar of Hunsur, who was able to transfer some newly-cleared forest land for a nominal fee.</p>
