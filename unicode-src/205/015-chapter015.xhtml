		<p><strong><em>The caste system at the turn of the century, as seen from the inside. Ursus and their privileges. A case involving Ursus and Brahmins. The class of professional entertainers. </em></strong></p>
		<p>The caste system was an inseparable part of life in the Mysore kingdom. It is probably the most discussed aspect of Hindu society, with many scholarly tomes devoted to it in the East and the West. But to one who has seen and experienced it first hand, most academic discussions of the caste system seem dry and lifeless – bereft of any humanity. I will now try to shed some light on how caste operated in the society that I knew intimately; and I will do this not through any theoretical discussions, but by describing episodes and characters drawn from my own experience.</p>
		<p>Everyone probably knows that a Hindu is born into a particular caste. Brahmins are of course said to be the highest caste, but in Mysore society they were neither the wealthiest nor the most privileged. The most privileged were the Ursus (or Arasus) – members of the caste to which the Maharaja himself belonged. Their male names always carried the postfix Urs, like my friend Kantha Raje Urs. The women went by the postfix Devi or Ammanni. The Maharaja’s mother who had ruled as regent during his minority was named Kempa Nanja Ammanni, but known more commonly by her formal title of Vani Vilas. Ursus were not numerous – they numbered about a thousand in a total population of five million in the state. But they were highly visible, concentrated in and around Mysore – the ceremonial capital of the state and the seat of the Maharaja’s court.</p>
		<p>The Ursus claimed to belong to the Kshatriya or the warrior caste, the second highest among Hindus. In fact, the Mysore royal family claimed descent from the prehistoric Yadava clan to which Lord Krishna himself is believed to have belonged – a claim that can only be accepted <span>on faith and incapable of proof.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-015-01">1 </a></sup>They were the privileged class of Mysore. Many of them had inherited lands and other property and were acutely conscious of their aristocratic status. In many ways, they were not unlike the aristocrats of pre-revolutionary France that one reads about. And like those French aristocrats, the Ursus also were imbued with a sense of noblesse oblige towards their friends and followers. They had many fine qualities like loyalty, charity, concern for the welfare of the common people, and generosity in the support of the arts and artists. Since Brahmins and Lingayats were by far the most educated castes in Mysore in those days, it was not uncommon to see wealthy Ursu families patronizing scholars and intellectuals from those two castes. </span></p>
		<p>Not a few of these Ursus (the plural of Ursu) imitated the style and mannerisms of the royal family. While still a boy, I was used to seeing them parading on horseback, accompanied by bodyguards, acting like little Maharajas. Some of them living in villages and not so affluent, were called “poor Ursus”; but even they would regard leadership as their birthright and hold court. It has always been a matter of amazement to me that other communities tolerated such behavior, though there was probably an element of pity, as towards a people who had known better days. Before the British Commission, the ancestors of many of these Ursus had held feudal offices, but were by my time no longer active in running the affairs of the state.</p>
		<p>But surprisingly, the Ursus were not prominent in the Government. Only one of them – Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs – ever rose to be Diwan, and even he was an educated man who had come up through the ranks. A few others from their caste occupied positions in the state militia, but for the most part the Ursus who worked in the Government held subordinate positions. One Ursu gentleman – Devaraj Urs of Moogur – who came from an old and aristocratic family had served under me as police inspector in Yedatore. But no matter what his or her official or financial position, every Ursu was regarded by every other Ursu as a member of the same family and to be treated as such. In this sense the Ursus were decidedly clannish and formed a clique. If any misfortune or dishonor fell on any member of their caste, the whole community shared in it. I can illustrate this from a case that had gained quite a bit of notoriety in my own time.</p>
		<p>The defendant in this case was one such aristocrat – the same Devaraj Urs of Moogur who later served under me as police inspector of Yedatore. Before his transfer to Yedatore, he had been a police inspector in Mysore where he had become embroiled in a case against two Brahmin youths. He had taken them into custody and held them in his police station on some charges that I cannot now recall. It was said that these boys behaved arrogantly, infuriating this aristocratic police officer. Devaraj Urs was alleged to have subjected them to physical abuse. The two boys were found innocent. Following their release, they brought charges of police brutality against Devaraj Urs.</p>
		<p>This was a case fraught with emotion. Devaraj Urs, as I noted earlier, came from an aristocratic family, and the Brahmins were especially enraged that he should physically abuse two of their boys. This they felt was the worst kind of arrogance – the arrogance of a pampered, privileged, class who thought the law did not apply to them. On the other hand, the Ursus and some of their followers felt that the Brahmin youths had been at fault, provoking Devaraj Urs with their own arrogant and un-co-operative attitude towards a man of his distinguished ancestry, treating him like just any petty government official.</p>
		<p>The case caused quite a commotion. A distinguished member the state assembly severely criticized Devaraj Urs’s high-handed conduct and called upon the Government to make an example of him to show that no one was above the law. His case was tried in the Sessions Court where he was found guilty and sentenced. On the day of the sentencing, many of the leading members of the Ursu caste had assembled in the Mysore Palace for some social function; this was just coincidence; it had nothing to do with the case as later alleged by some. Nonetheless, when someone brought word that the case had gone against Devaraj Urs, many of the guests burst into tears and the assembly soon broke up; the whole Ursu community went into a state of mourning. This may sound a little melodramatic, but I know it to be true. It was reported to me by some friends who were actually there. Later, Devaraj Urs himself confirmed the story.</p>
		<p>Devaraj Urs appealed the ruling. It was heard in the chief court where some of the evidence presented in the lower court was found inadmissible. He was acquitted on a technicality, escaping prison by the skin of his teeth. Later, when he was transferred to Yedatore, I asked him about the case. He admitted that he had roughed up the two Brahmin boys, but his supposed brutality had been greatly exaggerated.</p>
		<p>“I am sorry about the whole affair sir,” he told me. “The whole thing got blown out of proportion. People turned it into a caste dispute. It was nothing of the sort. It is not as if I had anything against them as Brahmins. They were just rude and arrogant – addressing me as if I were an illiterate country bumpkin.”</p>
		<p>“What is done is done,” I told him. “But I will not tolerate any of it. I go strictly by the rules. And as long as you are working for me, you better not create any problems.”</p>
		<p>He agreed. He was not an especially diligent or capable officer, but basically a decent man. He was always looking for some excuse to go to Mysore to visit his fellow Ursu friends, leaving his deputy in charge. That suited me also; his deputy was a much more capable officer. I have already related how Devaraj Urs’s botched efforts to capture Dodda Haida resulted in the latter murdering his wife.</p>
		<p>There were times when caste exerted a positive influence on the community, as for instance, during wedding celebrations. Marriages in those days were contracted only between families belonging to the same caste; inter-caste marriages were then virtually unknown. Whenever there happened to be a wedding celebration in a village, the entire community belonging to the bride’s (and the groom’s) caste would pitch in to make everyone look good, regarding it as a caste responsibility. If a particular village happened to be the stronghold of any one caste, a marriage in one of the prominent families could be quite grand affairs, with celebrations going on for a whole week. The Amildar would invariably be an honored guest at these weddings. There would be lavish entertainment programs provided by hired professionals. This brings to my mind another caste – the caste of professional entertainers – quite visible in those days, but one that no longer exists today as a separate caste.</p>
		<p>Classical Indian music and dance – especially of South India – are among the greatest achievements of Indian, or for that matter of any, civilization in world history. This fact is fully recognized today, and the best families encourage their sons and daughters to learn music and dance, and rightly take pride in displaying their children’s talents before the public. But this attitude is of relatively recent origin; in my time, women from good families – many of them highly accomplished artists never appeared before the public. Men often did; in fact, some of the greatest male singers and other musicians were Brahmins, as were nearly all teachers. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-015-02">2 </a></sup></p>
		<p>The women who performed in public formed a caste of their own, and often enjoyed the support of a wealthy patron. That is to say, they were courtesans. Though outstanding as musicians, what really brought them wealth and fame was their skill at classical Indian dance, an ancient art known as Bharata Natyam. Such a woman was generally known by the name Nayaka Sani. Despite being courtesans attached to a particular patron, they were not considered prostitutes, and, depending on their personal qualities, were often highly respected members of the community. Neither should they be confused with the so-called nautch girls of North India that one reads about. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-015-03">3 </a></sup></p>
		<p>Although they did not perform in public, girls from good families learnt music at home; and those from musical families acquired it almost with their mother tongue. The same was true of the professional artistes – the Nayaka Sani. Some of the greatest musicians of my era – Vina Dhanam, Tayi of Coimbatore, Sundari of Travancore, Naga Ratnamma of Bangalore – all immortal figures in our musical pantheon came from this class.</p>
		<p>I knew quite a few of them personally, and in fact, several of them have given performances at my home before my family and friends.</p>

		<p>Over the years I have developed the greatest respect for their dedication to their art, and their noble personal qualities. They were invariably devout, humble, and generous with a strong sense of community, often making lavish endowments to schools, hospitals, and other charities. And yet, for all their modesty, they knew their worth as artists, and were quick to defend their art and their standing as artists. I can recall an amusing incident involving an artist of a later era – the great singer Mrs. M.S. Subbu Laxmi – the possessor of the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-015-04">4 </a></sup></p>

		<p>Subbu Laxmi – one of the most celebrated musicians of her generation – and her husband, the journalist C. Sadasivam are family friends of ours. After one of her recitals in Bangalore, she was met backstage by a leading politician, who was then a member of the state cabinet in the early 1950s I think.</p>
		<p>“You see Madam Subbu Laxmi,” the great man said, beaming at her, “I have been listening to you sing for over ten years. Now that I appreciate you better – I think your music has improved noticeably.”</p>
		<p>“No, your honor!” she shot back, “it is your knowledge and appreciation of music that must have improved!”</p>
