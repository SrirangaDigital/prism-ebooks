<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">16 A CASE OF COMMUNAL DISCORD </h1>
<p><strong><em>A marriage procession leads to communal tension. Rama Rao’s handling of the affair. Support of the Muslim leaders. </em></strong></p>
<p>From what I have described so far, it is, I hope, apparent that caste was a significant factor in our society. It was something that no one – least of all a government official – could afford to ignore. It was not a matter of personal choice or feelings, but a reality that one had to deal with. One had to be sensitive to the feelings and rules of the various castes that made up our society. It was not always an easy task.</p>
<p>While caste rules were respected, and the Government made every effort not to offend any sensibilities, the law of the land was the same for all castes. That is to say, caste played no part in the settlement of court cases; under the law, all castes had the same rights. Failure to recognize this basic fact occasionally led to tense situations. I remember one such incident that took place in 1908, which I myself was inadvertently drawn into.</p>
<p>At that time I was serving as Amildar of T. Narsipur. It involved a caste known as Toreyas, who also called themselves Gangeya Makkalu. They claimed descent from infantry soldiers who had served in the armies of our ancient rulers. In support of this tradition, male members of their community always carried Nayaka as a suffix to their names. Theirs was a society organized along feudal lines. Each Toreya community in every town and village in which they happened to live had its own acknowledged hereditary chief and deputy chief. They were a warrior-like people and also very close knit as a group.</p>
<p>They typically went into the police force or worked as taluk servants. Some of them occasionally took up domestic service in the households of Vokkaligas who were thought to be a higher caste. A good number of them were fishermen and boatmen who had their dwellings on the banks of rivers. As often the case with such people, they were superb watermen. In my experience, they were proud, loyal, and industrious – a good- looking race of men and women, but a life of poverty and hardship took early toll on their health and looks. Their one fault – or should I say habit – was to spend any spare cash they might have on drink; these children of the river seemed to be afflicted with a thirst that no river could quench.</p>
<p>The episode I am about to relate grew out of a wedding celebration in the picturesque riverside town of Bannur. About three quarters of the population of Bannur in those was made up Vokkaliga farmers, shepherds, and Toreays. There was also a small Muslim community engaged mainly in trade. The dominant community was the Vokkaligas, consisting for the most part of relatively prosperous landowners, well-versed in the ways of cities like Bangalore and Mysore, and familiar with government procedures and the law courts.; in a word, the Vokkaligas were a sophisticated lot. The Toreyas, though a match for them in numbers, were far behind in wealth, sophistication, and influence.</p>
<p>The bride was the daughter of Malla Nayaka, the Toreya chief of Malavalli; the groom was the son of Mada Nayaka, his counterpart in Bannur. It was a wedding custom among these people to have a marriage procession taking the groom on horseback to the temple and bring him back together with his friends and family members. Mada Nayaka requested a license to take the bridal procession through the main street of Bannur, and return by a different route. The procession was to start on its way at about eight in the evening and would therefore have little effect on the traffic. This was a routine request, and I forwarded it to the inspector with instructions to take care of the security arrangements.</p>
<p>The inspector went over and surveyed the procession route, in particular the main street, normally the busiest thoroughfare in any town. The street was a public road with mainly Vokkaliga dwellings interspersed with a few shops and houses owned by Muslims. He reported back to me that he saw no reason why a peaceful procession with minimal effect on the traffic should not be allowed; the Vokkaligas routinely took their parades and processions through this street. But there was no precedent for a Toreyas’ procession. The Muslim residents had no objection to it and the inspector saw no reason why the Vokkaligas should have any. It was after all a public road, and the Toreyas had as much right to it as anybody else. So I gave them the permit.</p>
<p>We had made our decision going by law and common sense; but we had failed to reckon with prejudice and unreason. A few days after issuing this license, I found two leaders of the Vokkaliga community – Chamey Gowda and Thimmey Gowda – waiting for me in my office. They presented me with a petition signed by a hundred men protesting my decision to grant the permit to the Toreyas. They claimed it went against tradition for Toreyas to take a wedding procession in front of Vokkaliga houses. This, they further claimed, would be seen as a deliberate affront by the entire Vokkaliga community. They also accused the police of favoring the Toreyas over the Vokkaligas, and went so far as to suggest there might be disturbances if nothing were done. The two leaders asked me to revoke the license.</p>
<p>I refused.</p>
<p>“There have been many parades and processions involving people from your caste,” I said to them. “And they all use the main street and other public streets in town. Have the Muslims or any other communities ever objected to your processions? Toreyas are no different. As subjects of the Maharaja, they have the same rights as you and me.”</p>
<p>They stared at me in utter disbelief.</p>
<p>“But my lord!” exclaimed Thimmey Gowda. “These are Toreyas – the same caste as our servants! They carry our litter. They clean our bathrooms. How can they possibly have the same rights as us? We won’t accept it.”</p>
<p>I saw no point in continuing my argument with them. Every kind of mulish pig-headedness must give way before caste arrogance. Such minds are not exactly receptive to arguments based on logic and the rights of man.</p>
<p>“Now, listen to me,” I replied to them, politely but firmly, leaving no doubt in their minds about my resolve. “I have issued this permit exactly like every other permit – based on law and the police report. But you are now raising an extra-legal argument – alleging it goes against tradition and somehow constitutes an insult to your caste. This may be so, but it has no basis in law. I cannot change the order even if I wanted to. At the same time, you are not bound to accept my order. All you have to do is appeal to my superior in the district office and ask him to overrule me.”</p>
<p>They appealed to the deputy commissioner (DC) Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs who was also the district magistrate. He sent for representatives from both sides to present their arguments. Having heard them, he confirmed my order. He also sent me an order to ensure that the police took all necessary steps. He also assured me of any additional help that might be needed. The inspector was beginning to lose his nerve.</p>
<p>“Sir, this is turning into a tricky affair,” the inspector came to me and said. “It may even call for police firing – and may lead to rioting. You must oblige me by accompanying me to Bannur on the day of the celebration.”</p>
<p>I agreed. I decided it was best to take personal charge of the security. The inspector’s name was Chaman Raj Urs. He was said to be descended from the now defunct Anegondi ruling house. He was a fine gentleman but lacked that extra dash – the French call it elan – of really fine police officers like Khaja Mohammad Khan. We went forth and camped in Bannur on the day before the wedding celebration. A delegation of Vokkaliga leaders came to the traveler’s Bungalow where I was staying, asking to see me.</p>
<p>“How it possible my lord?” one of them appealed to me. “The DC has passed a very unfair order. We cannot accept it. We will take the matter to the Maharaja.”</p>
<p>A few others said things in the same strain.</p>
<p>“We are ready to pledge our lives if need be,” said one hothead. “Let some heads roll!”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to add more fuel to the fire, but I could not keep silent after what this youth said. I patiently explained to them that as Maharaja’s subjects they had to obey the law, and it was my duty to enforce it.</p>
<p>“It is not proper for me to discuss the district magistrate’s order,” I told them. “I am his subordinate officer. My job is to make sure that his order is enforced. When he passes a law in the area under his jurisdiction, it has the same force as the Maharaja’s own word. As his subjects, we must obey them. If you think his order is unfair, there are lawful ways of having it countermanded. You can appeal it. As long the order stands, anyone who violates it will be treated as a lawbreaker, and dealt with as such. It gives me no pleasure to punish any of you. So, don’t make it necessary. Also don’t throw away the good name of your town.”</p>
<p>I then thought I must explain to them the principle of the whole thing and how the Government felt about it.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you this much,” I continued, “We cannot have different laws for different castes. If we did – the result would be anarchy in a jungle. Also, no one in the Government will rule in your favor as long as you claim extra privileges on the basis of your caste at the expense of another caste. You must live and let live.”</p>

<p>My patience did seem to have some effect. As the crowd left, most members of the group seemed calmer than they were when they came. I then called the inspector to the Traveler’s Bungalow and asked him to brief me about the arrangements. He suggested that we should ask for additional help in the form of armed reserve police from Mysore. I turned his advice down. I did not see any point in taking what was a local situation, and blow it out of proportion. That would be making a tacit acknowledgement of our inability to control the people in a small town. Besides, calling in additional reinforcements would also convey the idea to the people that we were afraid of them, leading to a loss of respect and affection in the whole taluk. Also, these Vokkaliga lads were not exactly cowards – hardly the kind to turn tail and run at the sight of armed police. It would only rouse their emotions and make the situation worse. I needed the trust and loyalty of their community more than show of force. I could hardly hope to be an effective ruler with them as adversaries. Finally, could I show my face in public if my actions should lead to a few men getting killed?</p>
<p>I had reasons for believing that moderation and good sense would prevail. Many in the Vokkaliga community – perhaps a majority – were willing to live and let live. I had friends in the community who came and expressed their support for me, promising to do their best to see that good sense and rule of law would prevail.</p>
<p>The next morning – on the day of the celebration – I rode on as usual on my daily rounds of the nearby villages. About two miles outside Bannur, I caught sight of Sultan Saheb – a highly respected member of the Muslim community – waiting for me by a small bridge, smoking a cigarette. Upon seeing him, I dismounted and we greeted each other. He told me that the Shanbog of the neighboring village of Turuganur had told him that I would be coming by this route on my way to that village.</p>
<p>“Sir, why did you wait for me here?” I asked him. “You could have come by and seen me at the Traveler’s Bungalow where I am camping.”</p>
<p>“No my lord,” he replied, “I didn’t want to be seen visiting you. I wanted to meet with you in secret.”</p>
<p>We both seated ourselves on the railing of the bridge.</p>
<p>“Whom have you decided to place in charge of security at the Toreyas’ procession?” Sultan Saheb asked me.</p>
<p>“Oh! Is that what you wanted to see me about?” I asked, a little surprised. “Why? I’ll be there myself – personally, in charge.”</p>
<p>“There might be some trouble. I think it would be better if the inspector went instead.”</p>
<p>“You mean it would matter less if he got hurt?” I asked him. “I’m afraid I don’t quite see it that way.”</p>
<p>“Would it not have been safer to request additional reserve police from Mysore?”</p>
<p>“What makes you think I haven’t already done so?” I asked him. “Besides, I don’t share the opinion that everyone in this town is bent on stirring up mischief. There are many honorable, God-fearing, and law-abiding people like you living here. After all – is Bannur nothing but a den of outlaws?”</p>
<p>“That is precisely my point my lord!” he said with some emotion. “And that is what I want to talk to you about. You have the power to bring in the reserve police or even the state militia into town if you want. But it would give us a bad name. People will say this is a very bad place. There are many good families of our people also who live on that street. We also have a responsibility in this village. Our people love your lordship. Don’t forget us. We are behind you. Call upon us for any help you might need.”</p>
<p>I was touched by his concern, but masked it with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Don’t we have enough parties already?” I asked him with a smile. “Toreyas and Vokkaligas? You want to bring in a third party – of Muslims? And you want me – a Brahmin – to lead your people?”</p>
<p>This made Sultan Saheb laugh.</p>
<p>“Sir, I don't have your ready wit,” he said. “But I am not a fool either. All I am saying is this: if you come to the procession for supervision, we'll be your bodyguards. We are taking this responsibility upon ourselves. We'll be at your service.”</p>
<p>I took his hand in mine and said, “Many thanks Saheb! This is true friendship. I can never forget your kindness. But how do you plan to carry out your scheme? I can't have a bodyguard with me. I had planned to take only the inspector with me.”</p>
<p>“As you wish sir,” he responded. “But about twenty of our people will be there mingling with the crowd. They'll come to your help if you blow your whistle. These are boys from our gym. Ustad Khalif is in charge of the arrangements.”</p>
<p>I knew this Ustad Khalif as a very fine wrestler. In fact, I had heard that in one bout he had wrestled Subbanna of Gonigar to a draw. I had studied wrestling with Gonigar Subbanna in Mysore and knew him to be an excellent wrestler. He had been recognized by the Maharaja. So Ustad Khalif also must have been a good wrestler in his prime.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” I replied. “But no one should carry any weapons. Not even a stick or knife.”</p>
<p>“I give you that promise. Leave the rest to me.”</p>
<p>He shook me again by the hand and took my leave.</p>
<p>I returned to the Traveler’s Bungalow that afternoon. Some Vokkaligas came by asking to see me. I sent word that I would not be able to see them. The Toreya chief brought me a formal invitation to the wedding.</p>
<p>“I shall be there in time for the procession,” I told him. “Don’t start the procession until I get there and personally give the order for it to start. I can’t be there before that.”</p>
<p>Just before eight that evening, I received word that everything was in readiness. The sky was overcast and there was a fine drizzle. I put on a light overcoat over my regular clothes and left for the Toreya colony. I had with me the inspector and my personal orderly, a young policeman by name Mada. There was no one else. My decision was that there should be no show of force; my presence as the Maharaja’s representative was to impress upon them the importance that the Government attached to the rule of law.</p>
<p>The Toreyas received us at the entrance to their colony and led us to the groom’s house. His mount – an old stallion – was decorated with flowers, bouquets, and colored brocade cloth. It was an ancient war horse that must have heard the sound of cavalry bugles and trumpets in its youth; even now, its ears would perk up at the sound of kettledrums and other wedding instruments. It would also on occasion neigh and paw the ground with its hooves. There was a marching band; its musicians seemed to have been quite intoxicated.</p>
<p>Friends and relatives of the groom – all colorfully attired – escorted him to the front veranda of the house. Lamps, torches, and petromax lamps were lit, illuminating the whole area. The bridegroom came and saluted the inspector and me before mounting the horse. We both blessed him and signaled for the procession to start. There were roughly a thousand men and women in all representing both the bride’s and the groom’s side. The men promised by Sultan Saheb must also have been in the crowd; I could not identify any. Everyone was dressed in colorful clothes and looked cheerful. The people seemed filled with pride that their views had prevailed in getting a license for their parade. At the same time, there was no sign of arrogance or any hint that they might be looking for trouble. It was just natural enthusiasm brought forth by the occasion, and special delight that the Subedar himself had come to their assistance, gracing the occasion with his presence.</p>
<p>The bridegroom was hoisted on to the horse. He was wearing a long velvet coat and a gold braided white silk turban. A glittering red and green silk band was also strapped around his forehead. His head dress was topped by a wreath of flowers. He also had around his neck several colorful flower garlands that almost covered his attire. The sight of this young man in his spectacular attire, mounted on a horse, seemed to give immense pleasure to his relatives with their warrior traditions. There was much cheering as the procession started.</p>
<p>The inspector and I walked at the head of the procession as though we were leading it. The two of us had been generously garlanded with wreaths of colorful flowers, and must have presented an impressive sight in the flickering light cast by the torches and lamps. But my misgivings increased with every step. As we came out of the Toreya section, I led the procession into the main street with rising apprehension.</p>
<p>Most of the houses on the main street belonged to Vokkaligas, with a just a few Muslim houses interspersed among them. I am no stranger to danger; I have been in dangerous situations before – following murderers, wounded animals like tigers and leopards, and in foolhardy situations in the water. But never have I known the sense of tension – sense of cold fear – that I felt on this occasion. I had made the decision to take complete charge of the occasion, and I now felt the full weight of responsibility.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-016-01">1 </a></sup>I was not afraid for my own life; that was a small matter.</p>
<p>My concern was for the safety of a thousand people – men, women and children – who had trusted me by placing their lives in my hands. I had not called in the reserve police as suggested by more experienced people, confident that my presence alone was sufficient to ensure their compliance with the law. It is one thing to be confident in cold blood and quite another to face the moment truth in the harsh light of reality. I was being gnawed by self-doubt. Should there be a riot, I alone would be to blame.</p>
<p>We soon entered the main street. There was no traffic, but the sidewalks of the street were filled with Vokkaligas. I detected no hint of any anger or belligerence in their faces, but just sullenness. I felt somewhat relieved, for it did not look as though the Vokkaligas would be taking the offensive, though I felt they might retaliate if provoked. As we were moving at a leisurely pace, Sultan Saheb came out of his house and requested us to stop for a moment. He had brought with him a flower garland and a silver platter with some fruits and nuts like almonds and cashews. He garlanded me and handed my orderly Mada the fruits and nuts to be taken to my house for my wife and children. At that time I did not understand his gesture, but he later told me that it was a covert warning to anyone hostile to me that he regarded me as one of his own; anyone raising a hand against me could expect retaliation from his men. Whatever his reasons, the results were unexpectedly beneficial.</p>
<p>“Oh! It is the Subedar’s wedding procession!” guffawed one of the Vokkaliga lads. “He looks like the bridegroom.”</p>
<p>With all the flowers and garlands around my neck, I probably did.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the bride,” said another. “She must be in burqa.”</p>
<p>Burqa or purdah is the custom of keeping women in seclusion, followed by some Muslims at the time. At this crack the whole assembly burst into laughter, greatly to my relief. I joined in the fun, pretending to enjoy the joke at my expense. He was of course insinuating that Sultan Saheb was greeting me as the bridegroom with the bride in burqa – a joke not in the best of taste perhaps considering I was a happily married man – but it did serve to break the tension. Sultan Saheb joined the procession and walked down with us to the end of the street. A few Vokkaliga men and women also joined in the procession and everything went peacefully. The next day, a few Toreya leaders and I personally thanked the Vokkaliga leaders for helping good sense prevail.</p>
<p>From then on there were no mishaps and we returned to the starting point. The inspector and I took our leave and returned to the Traveler’s Bungalow.</p>
<p>“You saved the situation sir,” said the inspector.</p>
<p>“God is great,” I replied.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that all the trouble was due to a small minority in the Vokkaliga community, who, after starting the dispute found that events moved out of their control. I was also thankful to the Muslim community for their support and loyalty; it had a stabilizing effect. At the same time, I was not so naive as to flatter myself that they acted purely out of love for me, with no self-interest. As a very small community, they recognized that if the dominant Vokkaliga community were allowed to dictate terms to others, their own rights would not be safe. This is not to deny their regard for me – Sultan Saheb was a personal friend of mine – but only they were no less motivated by self-interest than the rest of us.</p>
<p>But ultimately, what saved the day was the devotion, respect, and love that people of all classes bore towards our late ruler – Maharaja Krishna Raja. As long as I acted in a manner that reflected my position as the legitimate representative of the Maharaja, no one would raise a hand against me. My conduct throughout had been based on this firm belief and it had proven true.</p>
