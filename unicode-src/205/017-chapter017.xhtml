<p><strong><em>P.N. Krishna Murthy retires as Diwan and V.P. Madhava Rao takes his place. The new Diwan’s likes and dislikes. Rama Rao and the Diwan’s favorites. A meeting with Madhava Rao. </em></strong></p>
<p>With the kind of administration we had in those days, it should surprise no one if politics and favoritism played a part in the selection and appointment of persons to high positions. Some officials went to extreme lengths to cultivate the political goodwill of influential persons and thereby enhance their own positions. Caste and communal considerations often entered into the equation. I can illustrate this by describing the events that led to my own falling out with V.P. Madhava Rao, in many ways the most political of our officials. He became Diwan in 1907 when my senior friend Sir P.N. Krishna Murthy retired. This was a little more than a year after I had assumed charge as Amildar of Yedatore.</p>
<p>Madhava Rao was not a native of Mysore, but one of the favorites brought in from the Tamil country by his fellow countryman Sir K. Seshadri Iyer, Krishna Murthy’s predecessor as Diwan. Madhava Rao seemed never entirely comfortable with native Mysoreans. For this reason he tended to surround himself with favorites from his own country and caste. Madhava Rao had started his career in Mysore in the state police force, and had risen to be its chief known in those days as Inspector General of Police. For a short period he had served as Diwan of the smaller native state of Travancore. This experience apparently was sufficient for him to be brought back to Mysore as Councilor. At that time, the Maharaja was still a minor and his mother Vani Vilas ruled as regent, with Seshadri Iyer as Diwan.</p>
<p>The Queen Mother had complete trust in Seshadri Iyer, and he too was loyal to her despite being an outsider. Consequently, Seshadri Iyer had only to recommend his successor and the Queen Mother was sure to appoint him Diwan. Madhava Rao fully understood the situation and tried hard to get Seshadri Iyer to supersede Krishna Murthy with himself. At first Seshadri Iyer seemed agreeable, but soon began to have reservations. The British representative – or the Resident as he was known – was concerned that the minority of the king was being taken advantage of by the immigrant community to monopolize the upper levels of administration at the expense of the natives. By the terms of the Anglo-Mysore treaty, the Resident had no say in the appointment of Diwans, but he provided evidence showing that Madhava Rao had been actively undermining Seshadri Iyer’s own position. This evidence indicated that during Seshadri Iyer’s illness, Madhava Rao, through some of his friends, had been floating suggestions that the Queen Mother should ask him to step down.</p>
<p>This intelligence, no less than his own conscience, made Seshadri Iyer – a devout and God-fearing man – to change his mind and recommend Krishna Murthy instead. On his deathbed, he apologized to Krishna Murthy for having contemplated injustice and told him, “I do not wish to face my maker with this injustice on my hands. You are worthy to be Diwan. May you serve your king and your country to the best of your ability and achieve fame.” And he gave Krishna Murthy his blessings and the highest recommendation. Krishna Murthy became Diwan and Madhava Rao had to cool his heels for several years.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-017-01">1 </a></sup></p>
<p>Diwan Krishna Murthy, a gentle guileless soul, was close to tears when he himself told me of this. Madhava Rao’s feelings at this turn of events can easily be imagined; and the enmity between him and Krishna Murthy dated from that point. To his chagrin, Madhava Rao had to serve as Senior Councilor, subordinate to his hated enemy Krishna Murthy.</p>
<p>Madhava Rao was not a man to forget or forgive an injury – real or imagined. This inability to separate personal feelings from professional judgments was an unfortunate trait in Madhava Rao, and one that often colored his administrative actions. Having known both the Diwans fairly well, I believe Krishna Murthy was the better statesman, with a fuller grasp of policy matters, and a better judge of people. He was also of a more scholarly and intellectual bent than Madhava Rao and not one to let personal feelings affect professional decisions. Madhava Rao was a master at revenue analysis, with an exceptional grasp of detail – not all that important in a Diwan – for the Diwan did not run the civil service; that was the job of the secretaries to the Government and directors of the departments. Later in my career I was to serve in both of those capacities.</p>
<p>Above all, Madhava Rao excelled at showmanship. He was an extraordinarily impressive figure with an austerely handsome face and a magnificent, imposing, build. In all my life, I don’t think I have ever seen a better-looking man or one of more impressive bearing. To go with this he had a carefully cultivated manner of aloof graciousness and studied dignity, spiced with a caustic wit. “No one can really be as distinguished as Mr. Madhava Rao looks!” once remarked Sir Evan Macanochie, private secretary to the Maharaja. Though there was more than a kernel of truth in that joke, it took quite a while for people to figure it out, and many never did. They were simply bowled over in his presence. At the same time, I don’t wish to leave the impression that Madhava Rao was incompetent. Far from it, only his presence contributed to his rise in position. Even when he was not Diwan he looked how a Diwan ought to.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-017-01">2 </a></sup></p>
<p>The fact that Madhava Rao was an intensely political creature is not in itself surprising, for he was neither the first nor is he likely to be the last man to reach high office through political skills and personal favors. But what was extraordinary about him was the extent to which his personal wish and political favoritism permeated the entire administration during his stewardship as Diwan. As an Amildar, I was a relatively junior official, and yet was not exempt from his attention on several occasions. I will next relate a few of my personal experiences with Madhava Rao. These should give an idea of how what should have been official decisions and actions were often turned into exercises in personal likes and dislikes. My intention in relating these episodes is not to settle any scores but only give a picture of how the Government operated when a high official let his personal feelings interfere in policy matters.</p>
<p>One of Madhava Rao’s first acts as Diwan was to reopen the competitive examinations for appointments to assistant commissioner posts. This was a deliberate reversal of the earlier policy by which people like me had been brought into the Government with the assurance of rapid promotion. This was not a contract but a statement of intent, which I fully expected the Government to honor. To this change of policy, of reopening competition, Madhava Rao added a new twist. Formerly, those like me who were already in the Government and had multiple university degrees were eligible to take the competitive civil service exams until age thirty. Madhava Rao lowered it to twenty-five. I was then twenty-eight. So his administration had not only gone back on the Government’s word, but had also changed the rules so that I was not even eligible to compete.</p>
<p>This impacted me personally. To this day I believe the only reason for this policy shift was to open the door for more immigrants from the Diwan’s own country (Madras State, now Tamil Nadu), and at the same time limit opportunities for qualified natives like myself. At my father’s suggestion I had taken the Mysore Civil Service Examination a few years earlier. For reasons I need not go into here, even though I had passed them with flying colors, I did not place high enough to be offered an assistant commissioner’s post. A couple of years later, Diwan Krishna Murthy brought me into the Government, the details of which I have already related.</p>
<p>But Madhava Rao knew he could not get away with his designs without some sort of a smoke screen. So he proclaimed that he wanted to attract the best possible talent by broadening the eligible talent pool. He further tried to reassure native Mysoreans by announcing that for every two outsiders, seven Mysoreans would be appointed from among those who had done well in previous exams, came from distinguished families, and had also demonstrated competence as Amildars. I felt I qualified on all these counts and decided to apply. In any case it was the only avenue open to me.</p>
<p>By then Sparkes had retired and Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs was my deputy commissioner (DC). The two of us, of course, knew each other well. He was also fully aware of the circumstances under which I was brought to Mysore. I decided to apply to him for the promotion. I emphasized how this was the only option left to me; had I been allowed to take the exams, I would have done so and not be asking him for support. I felt my qualifications and performance entitled me to be promoted.</p>
<p>The Sirdar was most gracious. “Of course I’ll recommend you,” he said, “it’ll be an honor. You have everything the Government has asked for and more. Your record speaks for itself. Who is better qualified than you are? I’ll give you my highest recommendation.”</p>
<p>He then wrote a recommendation letter to the Government praising me in the most flattering terms, enclosing me a copy in confidence. Whenever he had the chance, he spoke very highly of me to all the top officials including the Diwan.</p>
<p>“The Diwan for some reason seems ill-disposed towards you,” he said to me one day. “I don’t quite understand the reason. I have said all I can at every opportunity I get. I think you should meet with him personally and apply directly to him. After all, you know the Diwan.”</p>
<p>There could have been several reasons for Diwan Madhava Rao’s displeasure. First there was my close association with his hated enemy Diwan Krishna Murthy. Then there was his annoyance at my joining the Government ignoring his advice to continue with my private law practice. In addition, there were a few encounters – each trivial in itself</p>
<p>– which he nevertheless deemed sufficient reason for holding me back.</p>
<p>The first of these took place within a few days after Madhava Rao had taken charge as Diwan. At that time, an all-India exhibition had been planned for Mysore city to which I was deputed on special duty as chief of the section in charge of the livestock show. This was an event that went on for several weeks, with visitors coming from all over India and a few foreign countries. The preparations for the show also went on for weeks during which I had to be in Mysore. Whenever the Diwan happened to be in Mysore, he would pay a personal visit to the site and review the arrangements. On such occasions he would invariably be accompanied by an entourage made up of his favorites and a few officials hoping to gain his favor and attention. Some of them had the habit of showing off their importance to the officials actually in charge of the work; whether they acted in this fashion to attract the Diwan’s attention or simply out of arrogance I am unable to say. But the result was the same. I was drawn into an exchange with one such person during one of the Diwan’s visits. It came about as follows.</p>
<p>One morning, the Diwan’s party arrived at my work area as I was engaged in measuring and marking out stalls in the space allotted to the livestock exhibit. On such occasions he usually would stop for a few minutes, observe the work, and move on. On rare occasions he might make a suggestion or two; most of the time he would simply go on ahead to the next area. On this occasion, as he approached my area, I stood up and greeted him as usual, which he acknowledged with a smile and a nod. After spending a few minutes looking over my arrangements, he went on his way without saying a word. I went back to my work of measuring out stalls with a tape measure. But one of the Diwan’s special favorites took it into his head to make a show of his self-importance at my expense, in an area where he had no business intruding.</p>
<p>“I say, what it is that you are doing” he asked, bending over the stall where I was working as he addressed me.</p>
<p>“I am marking out parallel lines,” I replied indifferently, without looking up to face him. He felt insulted.</p>
<p>“Look here! This is no way of talking to me. Do you at least know what parallel lines are?”</p>
<p>“My name is Navaratna Rama Rao,” I said with a smile, standing up to face him. “And I can put a few letters after that name. I have also passed the Mysore Civil Service Examination. You may safely come to me if you wish to learn about parallel lines – and I shall be happy to teach you when I have leisure. But as you can see – I am busy now.”</p>
<p>Everyone present, including the Diwan’s followers, laughed out aloud at this repartee. It was no secret that this man – a courtier and a man of scant education – was in a lucrative position due entirely to Madhava Rao’s favor. He was a portly, somewhat elderly, red-faced man. I thought he might come down with apoplexy as blood rushed to his face. Nothing like that happened; he was a tough old survivor. He left me in a huff and rushed over to join the safety of his group. The Diwan must have heard this exchange. He turned and gave me a cool glance with half-closed eyes. I knew this episode would be filed away in his memory and debited to my account.</p>
<p>Not long after this episode, I had another negative encounter with the Diwan. But first I need to fill in some background. In Yedatore taluk was an old jagir called Gondana Halli. It had been awarded to a Maratha Brahmin officer for his heroism in the Battle of Mahidpur – a minor engagement in the early eighteenth century. The descendants of the original jagir-holder had come close to losing their estate to creditors due to excessive borrowing and other general mismanagement. As a last resort, the young heir, Krishna Rao by name, appealed to Madhava Rao who was then Senior Councilor, a few years before he was to succeed as Diwan. The young man gave a graphic account of how his heroic family, which had shed its blood for the country, was now in danger of losing its inheritance to some moneylenders. He begged the Councilor to do something to save him from misfortune and disgrace. Madhava Rao was a very generous spirit who would never say ‘no’ to someone who came to him in submission. He was greatly moved by the plight of the young nobleman. He was also an admirer of military families, which he believed provided a moral foundation for society. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-017-01">3 </a></sup></p>
<p>Madhava Rao then had a detailed audit made of the financial state of the jagir and concluded that with proper management, all outstanding loans could be cleared without much difficulty. On his initiative, the Government assumed all outstanding debt, with the stipulation that the jagir would be administered as government property until all the loans had been paid off. The estate would revert back to the original holders once it was restored to financial health. He also made arrangements for the family to be paid a pension from out of the jagir revenues during its administration by the Government.</p>
<p>This arrangement had been in force for a few years when I joined the Government in 1904. When I took charge as Amildar of Yedatore, the administration of Gondana Halli jagir naturally came under my jurisdiction. Technically it was no different from the administration of any other government property, but it brought me into frequent contact with the jagirdar Venkat Rao and his heir Krishna Rao – the young man whose initiative had saved the jagir. The family lived in a small village called Dagganhal, which also belonged to their jagir. My work with the family soon led to a close friendship between our two families. Krishna Rao and I were about the same age and came from the same community, both being Maratha (Deshastha) Brahmins. More importantly, we discovered that our families had connections going back more than a century and had shared experiences. Our blossoming friendship made me ever more energetic in managing their estate to pay off their debts, restore it to the rightful owners, thereby fulfilling the wish behind Madhava Rao’s magnanimous gesture. This made Krishna Rao especially grateful to me, and he soon came to regard me almost like an elder brother.</p>
<p>In those days, during the ten-day Dussera festival in October, the Government used to host an official luncheon for elected representatives, important citizens, and other invited guests. Any government servants who happened to be in Mysore at the time would also attend. The Diwan was the official host of the event and his staff, drawn from the secretariat, would be in charge of the arrangements. He would spend that afternoon socializing with the guests and in conversation. On one such occasion, I believe it was in October 1906, I happened to be seated quite close to the Diwan, well within his sight. As was the custom in those days, I had removed my coat and turban and left them with the attendant in a room adjoining the banquet hall. When it was time for me to leave, I got up to go and retrieve my coat and turban. When Krishna Rao saw me preparing to leave, he himself went into the room, fetched my coat and turban, and helped me put them on.</p>
<p>“Why go to all this trouble?” I asked, embarrassed by his attention in such a public place.</p>
<p>“Service to a senior friend,” he replied smiling.</p>
<p>The Diwan had been observing the whole thing with mounting displeasure. He later sent word to the young man through his home office clerk C.E. Rama Rao to the effect, “Your conduct is unbecoming of a man of your distinguished lineage. It simply feeds the Amildar’s arrogance.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if the Diwan really said so. I only know that C.E. Rama Rao mentioned it to my friend.</p>
<p>Arrogance. This was a charge that was to follow me all through my career and beyond. I heard echoes of this many times one of which particularly comes to mind. This happened a few years later. Madhava Rao had retired and Sir T. Ananda Rao had taken his place as Diwan. I had been promoted and was under consideration to be promoted again for a post in the secretariat in Bangalore. At that time, late in the year 1911, the chief secretary Mr. Chandra Shekar asked me to meet him in Bangalore. By then my work as Amildar of T. Narsipur (1907-1909) and my later work in Shimoga (as SDO) had made me well known in the Government, but the two of us had not met before. During our meeting he was at first somewhat stiff and aloof, but gradually began to mellow. As our meeting, which lasted about an hour was drawing to a close, I began to sense that his feelings towards me had changed to regard and even admiration. He had almost become a fan of mine.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I sent for you?” he asked me pleasantly, as I was about to take his leave.</p>
<p>“You have never had the opportunity of observing me,” I replied. “But now that you are going to have me in your office, I suppose you just wanted to know at first hand who this strange creature is.”</p>
<p>“Yes and no,” he replied smiling, as he shook me by the hand. “For one so young, you have built up quite a reputation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-017-04">4 </a></sup>I just wanted to see for myself if the reports I have received about your personality are true or not. I have heard that you are exceedingly arrogant, that you believe yourself to be supremely knowledgeable about everything – this is the report I received from a certain person. I felt I had to meet a young man who could generate a report like that at the highest levels. What do you have to say? Is it true?”</p>
<p>Needless to say that “certain person” was none other than V.P. Madhava Rao. I masked my rising anger with a laugh.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite understand you,” I replied. “Which of that whole litany of charges do you want me to confirm or deny?”</p>
<p>“The charge that you have a very good opinion of yourself – is it true?”</p>
<p>“True sir, very true, indeed!” I replied quite emphatically. “I am not a fool. Nor am I one to grovel before anyone and say ‘I am a total incompetent. Please take pity on me and give me a promotion.’ God has been kind to me. He has blessed me with as much talent as anybody else. I have the confidence that I can discharge any responsibility reasonably well.”</p>
<p>“Then you are just the man we need,” he said laughing. “Get ready to come here soon.”</p>
<p>A related incident had taken place a few months before this meeting. Shortly before succeeding Madhava Rao as Diwan, Sir T. Ananda Rao, while still Councilor, visited me a few times when I was Amildar of T. Narsipur. I was then engaged in some difficult work relating to regularizing revenue accounts. Soon after he assumed charge as Diwan, I had received rapid promotions, first as registrar in Bangalore and then as subdivision officer (SDO) in Shimoga. In 1911, Ananda Rao visited me again in Shimoga.</p>
<p>“I have heard some interesting things about you,” he said to me with a smile. It was a rare occasion when Ananda Rao spoke, and rarer still when he smiled. “No one has ever said that you are lacking in intelligence – or that you are deficient in energy or ability. But a high official has told me that your sense of repartee is not to everyone’s liking.”</p>
<p>Again, I felt I was hearing the echo of the episode at the banquet. But Ananda Rao did not hold it against me. He promoted me again, leading to my interview with Chandra Shekar that I just described. I was to hear this echo from Diwan Madhava Rao himself when I went to see him about my promotion. As I reported earlier, after Kantha Raje Urs failed to persuade the Diwan to promote me, he advised me to apply to him in person. I took three days’ leave and went to see the Diwan when he was visiting Mysore.</p>
<p>While in Mysore, the Diwan used to stay at a place known as the Seshadri House. I would go there early in the morning, join the crowd in the visitor’s room, and send in my card requesting an appointment with the Diwan. I have already remarked how Madhava Rao liked to surround himself with favorites chosen more for their personal loyalty and obsequiousness than any special merit. These men would sometimes hold court in the visitors’ room, acting like little Diwans, displaying for all to see their high standing with the great man. A few of these courtiers even tried their tricks on me. I gave them as good as I got. I remember one man in particular approach me, winking at others like him and say to me, “Hello, Navaratna Rao Sahib. You seem like a devotee waiting at the temple door. What are you hoping for?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am hoping to receive the same blessings from your deity that you did,” I retorted.</p>
<p>Another, an older man, who had just been favored with an extension of service asked me, “What is the story, sir? There doesn’t seem to be much to do in your taluk judging by the time you spend here.”</p>
<p>“In the two days that I have been here,” I told him, “I keep seeing you too all the time. I’m still young sir. I have more time in my store to expend than you do.”</p>
<p>He went away stroking his dyed moustache. For three days, I tried without success to get an interview with the Diwan. Every morning, exactly at eight, the Diwan would come out dressed in riding clothes and boots wearing an expression of stern dignity. He would then salute the people assembled with folded hands, walk down the steps and mount the horse being held for him by an officer of the cavalry department. Accompanied by his cavalry officer, he would leave at a trot for his morning ride. He would return exactly at ten, hand his horse to the man waiting for him and go into the house. This was a signal to people like me waiting to see him, that he would not be free for the rest of the day. He would be tied up in official work, business meetings, visit to the palace, state dinners and other responsibilities that came with his office.</p>
<p>This went on for three days, without any appointment. I extended my leave by one more day but decided I must somehow get time alone with the Diwan. I was friendly with Nana Swamy Rao, the Diwan’s personal aide. I cornered him and begged, “You must somehow get me some time alone with the Diwan.”</p>
<p>“Look, Rama Rao,” he replied, “I will certainly get you a meeting with him, but don’t hold me responsible for the outcome.”</p>
<p>He obviously knew I was not in the Diwan’s best books.</p>
<p>“Immediately after lunch,” he continued, “the Diwan spends about half an hour looking at some illustrated magazines. I’ll take you to see him then. You may bravely say whatever wish to say to him.”</p>
<p>I was amused by his choice of the word “brave.” I suspect that not many of his men were brave in the Diwan’s presence!</p>
<p>“Am I going to be brave?” I asked. “After all he’s not going to eat me. He’ll just have had his lunch!”</p>
<p>I must have smiled a little at my own joke. “Yes sir!” he replied, failing to read my joke. “He’ll be in a good mood. You can speak to him freely.”</p>
<p>I waited following his instructions. At about half past noon, Nana Swamy Rao came out and took me inside the hallway and announced in Marathi, “Navartna Rama Rao aalaa aahe.” (“Navaratna Rama Rao has come here.”)</p>
<p>(Barre, yevoon de.”) “Good! Show him in,” I heard Madhava Rao say in the same language.</p>
<p>I went into the room and found the Diwan seated on a sofa with a lot of cushions, with his legs fully stretched out. I saluted him respectfully with folded hands. He returned my salute with a pleasant expression and motioned to me to a chair close by him.</p>
<p>“What can I do for you?” he asked, addressing me in English.</p>
<p>“Sir,”I began also in English, “I am Navaratna Rama Rao, Amildar of Yedatore.”</p>
<p>“I know very well, very well indeed,” he replied speaking to me in Marathi this time. “Navaratna Balakrishna Rao’s son. No need to recount your antecedents and ancestry. Please tell me your business. Are you on extended leave? I seem to be seeing you daily.”</p>
<p>“I came on three days’ casual leave,” I explained. “I extended it by a day today. I came here entirely to see you.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked the Diwan.</p>
<p>I then gave him substantially the same account that I had earlier given to Kantha Raje Urs.</p>
<p>“Sir, if the option of competing through the exam were available to me,” I said to him emphasizing my main point, “I would not be here applying to you to be promoted. But now with this new policy, I am left with no option. The Government has also stated its intention to fill some of these positions with people with the right qualifications – education, family reputation, previous civil service record, and demonstrated ability in the Government. I respectfully submit to you that I qualify on all these counts.”</p>
<p>“Splendid! You certainly know how to blow your own trumpet,” he said reiterating his “arrogance” theme.</p>
<p>“You may talk to my deputy commissioner concerning my qualifications,” I replied, hiding my annoyance. “I am aware that one normally should not advertise one’s own qualifications, but there are exceptions. It is said that the child that refused to cry starved to death.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I too have heard that proverb,” he said. “Are there any openings at the assistant commissioner level?”</p>
<p>“The Government should be in a better position than I to know that.” I replied, somewhat taken aback by his question. “The last announcement I saw said there were seven.”</p>
<p>“There were. There aren’t any now. What else can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“What more can I say? When you have said there are no openings, to persist with my appeal would not only be illogical but impertinent,” I continued. “All I ask is that I be given a fair opportunity – one which my qualifications merit. I don’t know if I am guilty of some offence. If I am, I request your continuing good graces and pardon.”</p>

<p>“You can be assured of that.”</p>
<p>“Good bye!” I said taking his leave.</p>
<p>“Good bye and good luck!” he responded, as he stood up to see me off. I left his room and went back to the place where his aide was waiting for me. I was left confused by the combination of unfailing courtesy and his unbending inflexibility towards my request.</p>
<p>“That must have been quite a meeting!” exclaimed Nana Swamy Rao as I came out. “You must have had a wide ranging discussion. What happened? Did it go well?”</p>
<p>“Well! The soap was full of fragrance,” I replied, “but all I got was a clean shave.”</p>
<p>I concluded that there was no possibility of promotion as long as Madhava Rao was Diwan. My wait didn’t last very long.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Note Added After the Translation:</strong></p>
<p>Madhava Rao’s own exit was unceremonious. On a trivial pretext – for tearing down a wall near the Bangalore Fort – he was made to submit his resignation, which the Maharaja accepted without hesitation. This is still the reason given for his resignation found in books like D.V. Gundappa’s ‘Mysorina Diwanaru’. This is not believable. There were more weighty reasons, like his favoritism and mistreatment of native officers (like Rama Rao) that had given the administration a bad name. In 1909, when Madhava Rao was particularly vindictive towards Rama Rao, Kantha Raje Urs brought it to the attention of his sister (Queen Mother Vani Vilas) and the Maharaja. Within a few months, Rama Rao was promoted and Madhava Rao practically forced to resign. (Rama Rao never mentioned it in public probably out of modesty and courtesy towards Madhava Rao’s relatives several of whom were close to Rama Rao.)</p>
<p>After Madhava Rao’s retirement, there appears to have been a reconciliation of sorts between the two men. Some years later, Rama Rao visited Madhava Rao in Tanjore. Madhava Rao also visited Rama Rao several times, including for dinner, when they were both living in Bangalore. By the time he wrote his memoir, Rama Rao’s reputation had eclipsed Madhava Rao’s, who by then had faded into obscurity. Apart from his literary achievements, as an administrator also, Rama Rao left his former superior far behind. He created the silk industry in Mysore, making Mysore silk world famous. Madhava Rao has nothing comparable to show. His name survives today largely because Rama Rao’s pen brought him back to life. Madhava Rao’s one lasting contribution was restoring Sri Shankaracharya’s birthplace Kaladi when he was Diwan of Travancore.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Madhava Rao’s great-grandson married one of Rama Rao’s granddaughters.</p>
