<p><strong><em>Rama Rao is transferred to T. Narsipur taluk. Taking leave of Yedatore. His last meeting with Devarsay Gowda. </em></strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the Bidirakka case had been settled, I received official notice of transfer to Tirumkudla Narsipur, better known as T. Narsipur as Amildar. T. Narsipur, not to be confused with Holey Narsipur in Hassan district where the riot took place, was in Mysore district, which meant I would still be reporting to Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs. I have earlier related the incident in which I had to deal with the troublemaker Basava Rajappa during the Maharaja’s circuit trip to Narsipur; I would now be in charge of that taluk. While serving as Amildar of Narsipur, I had the honor of playing host to the Maharaja’s mother, Her Highness Vani Vilas, when she visited my taluk. It was a memorable occasion that I have reserved for a later time.</p>
<p>It was not exactly a promotion, but decidedly a more responsible position. Narsipur taluk was more urban than Yedatore, with nearly twice the population and three times the revenue. But over the past several years, the administration of Narsipur taluk had taken a turn for the worse with the result both revenue collection and the law and order situation had suffered. I was told by the Diwan’s office that I had been put in charge of the taluk precisely because of my excellent record in Yedatore in both revenue matters and law enforcement. I also received a substantial salary increase. It is interesting that though Diwan V.P. Madhava Rao freely acknowledged my talents, he refused to promote me for purely personal reasons. This pattern was to persist even after he himself went on record stating that, my administration in Narsipur was the best in the state. But that is a different story that I’ll reserve for later.</p>
<p>When word of my transfer got around, the people of Yedatore – especially the poor and the peasants – overwhelmed me with their expressions of love, respect, and gratitude. There was a regular stream of visitors from all over the taluk, many of whom had travelled miles to wish me good fortune. I was greatly touched by their expressions of affection, making me at times unable to speak.</p>
<p>“What is it I have done?” I kept wondering, “that would not have been done by anyone else in my position?” I was after all, a relatively junior official, and it was not as though I was Amildar by birth. Who all had I saved? All I had done was to exercise what God had given me to the best of my ability, to serve my king and his subjects.</p>
<p>These expressions of love, respect, and the gifts they brought me, were truly a reflection of the generosity of our people who return every small kindness tenfold. With the passage of time, I recognize now that the two years or so that I had served in Yedatore were the absolute springtime of my life. I had not yet suffered any heartbreaking bereavements or disappointments so massive as to make life seem futile.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-019-01">1 </a></sup>Now in my golden years, my life like anyone else’s has known its share of happiness and sorrow, but God in his infinite generosity has blessed me with happiness and fortune that is beyond my due. Even now, when I reflect back on those days, the memories fill me with feelings of joy and serenity like upon entering a garden in springtime or a moonlit harvest night.</p>
<p>A couple of days before I was to leave Yedatore, I had an experience that truly filled me with awe and has remained an imperishable part of my life. It was early in the evening, and I was busy packing a few final items in preparation for our departure. A messenger came in and announced that Patel Devarsay Gowda had come to see me. The Bidirakka case had been settled about two months earlier, and I had not seen him since. Also, as I have already related, I had him removed from office for his failure to report the crime. What a blow this must have been to this proud man whose family had enjoyed the position of Patel of Saligrama from time immemorial can be imagined. At first I thought he must have come to vent his anger upon me and avenge his recent humiliation, knowing full well that I would be gone. My initial impulse was to deny him the opportunity by refusing to see him. I then felt it would be cowardly for me to refuse him – an old man with whom I had been through so much – denying him his last wish. If I had to take some abuse, it was nothing compared to his own misfortune in which I had an unhappy hand.</p>
<p>I sent word with the messenger to invite the Gowda and his party in. I received him and his entourage consisting of two boys – a grandson and a servant – in my living room. He approached me and saluted me with a deep bow, his hands almost touching the ground. I was shaken by the extent of transformation in his appearance, and deeply touched by his gesture. Within the past few months, his once powerful and vigorous body had shrunk, and he had fallen abruptly into old age. He was an elderly man, about my father’s age; and the sight of this man, so ravaged by misfortune, and yet coming all the way to pay me his respects was an experience that I have no words to describe.</p>
<p>I stood up to receive him. Taking both of his hands in mine, I said, “Sir! To what do I owe the honor of your visit?”</p>
<p>He was quiet for a moment, then cleared his throat and said, “I heard, my lord – you’re taking leave of us. I have not many years left. I don’t know when I shall see you again. I just came to pay my respects, wish you happiness, and receive your lordship’s blessings.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-019-02">2 </a></sup></p>
<p>“Sir, you are a great man,” I said speaking with great difficulty. “And what you just said reflects nobly on your ancient house. Everything about you fills me with awe and humility. What have I ever done to merit this generosity? It was my misfortune to be the one responsible for your misfortune. But it is some consolation to me that your good name was cleared of any taint in that dreadful crime.”</p>
<p>“Why do you blame yourself for my fate?” he replied, dismissing my clumsy attempt at an apology. “You kept your word. I left my life and my honor in your hands – and you preserved them. My misfortune was of my own making. The Gods were against me.”</p>
<p>I was stunned. His noble soul saw only the good in others, never an injury. Perhaps that was his undoing.</p>
<p>“May the good Lord bring you, your wife, and your children all the happiness,” he continued, “I have brought some parting gifts. You must honor me by accepting them.”</p>
<p>He then turned to the two boys who were waiting behind him and gestured to them to bring the gifts to me. They came forward, carrying two silver platters containing fruits, coconuts, betel leaves, and other such offerings of respect customary in those days. I tried to say some words of thanks, but found myself unable to speak. I received them, without a word.</p>
<p>I then accompanied the Gowda, my arm on his shoulder, down the steps leading to the street in front of my house. We then shook hands and bowed and saluted each other with folded hands. He turned away and walked down the street to his ox-cart parked at the end of the street, without once looking back. This once robust man now looked gaunt but walked with a firm step, with his head unbowed. I saw him reappear from the evening shadows and then disappear into his covered ox-wagon.</p>
<p>I never saw him again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Likeness of Patel Devarsay Gowda? </em></strong></p>

<p>Computer processed image of an old picture (c. 1905) sent to Rajaram by a reader. It cannot be authenticated but it is the nearest we are likely to get to seeing the great Patel then aged about 65. His sharp aristocratic features and proud son of the soil bearing seem to fit the description given in the text.</p>
