		<p><strong><em>SDO V.N. Iyer and his ‘old rats’. Rama Rao’s last meeting with Diwan Krishna Murthy. An unusual dinner. </em></strong></p>
		<p>As previously noted I was transferred to Tirumakudla Narsipur</p>
		<p>(T. Narsipur) as Amildar. In the few days ‘joining leave’ that I had before reporting for my new position, I handed over charge to my successor in Yedatore and stopped in Mysore to visit my father. Traveling with my family, I next stopped for a few days in Nanjangud on the way to T. Narsipur. I wanted to offer worship at the famous Nanjundeshwara Temple. Nanjangud was also the headquarters of my subdivision officer (SDO) Vaidya Natha Iyer (V.N. Iyer) who had asked me to see him before assuming charge in Narsipur. We stayed as guests of the Nanjangud Amildar Dharma Rao – a dear friend of mine.</p>
		<p>I went to see SDO V.N. Iyer. He was the brother-in-law of the famous Diwan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer. He owed his position entirely to this family connection for he was not a particularly able official. I had seen him in a few meetings in Mysore but had made no effort to get to know him. He was a very orthodox Iyer aged about 53 or 54 – nearly twice my age. He was extremely devout and spent the better part of his morning in prayer and ritual. I had also heard that he was a Shakteya— or a follower of the Shakti cult.</p>
		<p>As an official he was not distinguished in any way. He was a weak man, easily influenced by others, with little judgment of his own. I had also heard that a couple veteran clerks, ‘old rats’ they were called, practically ran the office. They were in attendance when I went to see the SDO. They treated me with extreme courtesy, bordering on unction, which put me on guard. The SDO, V.N. Iyer, received me cordially and said that the administration in Narsipur, the taluk that I was about to take over as Amildar, had greatly suffered in recent years.</p>
		<p>“Weak officials have allowed the administration to go slack,” he told me. “Your first responsibility is to bring it back into shape. You can expect my full support in this regard.” His clerks, the ‘old rats’, also nodded sagely in assent. I thanked him and got up to leave. As I was leaving, the SDO invited me to dine with him at half past eight the following evening; I accepted.</p>
		<p>My senior friend Diwan Krishna Murthy happened to be in Nanjangud on the way to his jagir or ancestral estate of Yelandur. He was staying with a relative (and family retainer) by name Guru Rao. I went to see him. He was seated with a shawl wrapped around his shoulders in the hall of Guru Rao’s house, in a large chair stacked with cushions. I had not seen him in a couple of years. In these years he had gone down a lot. Understandably, there was little of the energy or the force of authority of his earlier days, but what I saw in his face seemed to indicate a loss of interest in the world; he seemed almost to be resigned to his fate. I had heard that this health had not been good; his appearance too suggested the same thing.</p>

		<p>As soon as I saw him, a sense of profound regard, combined with a certain compassion for his current condition, welled up within me. On an impulse I prostrated myself before him, in the manner of saluting my father and other elders. This was entirely spontaneous. No one could accuse me of having any ulterior motives. I still feel a sense of righteousness whenever I recall it, for I never saw Krishna Murthy again. (He died in 1912.)</p>
		<p>“This is highly improper, Rao Sahib of Navaratna”, he protested, “Please rise. You are the scion of a holy family; a family touched by God. You should not be saluting a common man like me in this manner.” He was referring to the fact that a few members of the Navaratna family had been pontiffs of the Madhva Uttaradhi Mutt of which Krishna Murthy and his family were devout followers. The best known of them was Satya Dharma Teertha, a contemporary of the famous Diwan Purnaiah, Krishna Murthy’s own great-greatgrandfather.</p>
		<p>“Sir, you became Diwan following in the footsteps of your great ancestor,” I said with affected humor, “but I didn’t follow my elders and take holy orders. My father has high regard for you. I have heard that your family has been generous in supporting our ancestors in the discharge of their duties.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-020-01">1 </a></sup>You made it possible for me to serve in my present position. So, my respect for you is both inherited and earned.”</p>
		<p>These words came from my heart. After some discussion about our families and other mundane matters, the Diwan asked me, “Are you willing to come to Yelandur as Amildar? We need a strong man like you there. The Government has agreed to appoint anyone I ask for.”</p>
		<p>I told him that I would think about his offer and let him know. I saluted him again and took his leave.</p>
		<p>I wrote him later rejecting his offer. Yelandur was a small taluk in an obscure corner of the state. Anyone going there as Amildar would fall out of sight, without a future. The taluk was practically an extension of the jagirdar’s (Krishna Murthy’s) family court, infested with an army of relatives and family retainers. These did little beyond nursing grudges and hatching plots that would put Chanakya to shame. If the Amildar failed to please each and every one of the parties, the dispute would be taken to the jagirdar himself. No self-respecting official could function under such a regime. I would sooner be swimming in shark-infested waters than deal with these members of the idle class.</p>
		<p>As I mentioned earlier the SDO had asked me for dinner at half past eight. It so transpired that my host Dharma Rao had also arranged a dinner reception for me at the same time. As I had already promised the SDO, I begged Dharma Rao to postpone it to the following day. He was disappointed but agreed.</p>
		<p>“So you are going to pass up the sumptuous feast I had planned for you,” he joked, “for the insipid fare to be dished out by that old puritan.” I replied I had no choice.</p>
		<p>I showed up at SDO V.N. Iyer’s door at half past eight sharp. A servant boy opened the door and said, “The Sahib has had his dinner and gone to bed.”</p>
		<p>I was startled. “Why, is he unwell?” I asked. “No sir,” the boy replied, “it is normal for the Sahib to dine at eight and retire to bed immediately. He stays up a little longer when there is some work to be done. Should I tell him anything?”</p>
		<p>“Nothing important, really. Please tell him in the morning that I – Amildar of Narsipur – was here at eight thirty as requested by the Sahib.”</p>
		<p>As this was going on, the SDO showed up at the window and said, “Hello, Mr. Rama Rao! What brings you here? Anything new?”</p>
		<p>“Nothing new, sir,” I replied. “Nothing whatsoever. The temple, the river, the mountains – they are all where they have always been. None of them is showing any sign of change. Only I am a bit hungry. You were kind enough to ask me for dinner at half past eight. Well, here I am.”</p>
		<p>Not knowing whether to be angry or amused at the absurd situation I found myself in, what I said must have sounded a little bitter and sarcastic to the poor old man. He was thoroughly flabbergasted.</p>
		<p>“O, my God!” he exclaimed, almost collapsing with embarrassment. “I completely forgot. Sir, please come in.” Then, calling to his servant, “Get some light. Where is Seshaiyer? Seshaiyer, O! Seshaiyer! Are you alive or dead? You please come in, sir.”</p>
		<p>Seshaiyer the cook came running in, half-dressed, chewing paan.</p>
		<p>V.N. Iyer turned to me and said, “Please be seated, sir. Food will be ready in a few minutes – as we are talking about a few things.” Then turning to the cook, “Some rice, rasam or sambar, but be quick about it. Fry some papad and vada – and some pickle. Let’s see how fast you can make it.”</p>
		<p>By then my annoyance had completely vanished in the face of my host’s predicament; only the humor of the situation remained.</p>
		<p>“Believe it or not,” he said, “it completely slipped out of my mind. Ladies are out of town. This wouldn’t have happened if they had been home. Still, when I sat down for dinner, something seemed to be amiss – as if I had forgotten something."</p>
		<p>“I couldn’t forget, my tummy kept reminding me,” I replied. “But why go to all this trouble. My host Dharma Rao and his family will not have eaten yet. I can go join them for dinner.”</p>
		<p>“How is that possible Mr. Rama Rao!” he said in shock. “It is a great sin to turn back a guest on an empty stomach. An invited guest is like God’s own visit.” And so on and so forth.</p>
		<p>Of course, God is always happy, presumably with an eternally full stomach, but I was famished. I did not insist too much. Having already asked Dharma Rao to postpone his dinner, I didn’t want to go back for dinner and face possible ridicule. Also, poor old V.N. Iyer was almost prostrate with embarrassment, and I didn’t have the heart to make it worse for him. There was also an element of stubbornness, that I should make him treat me to dinner – having invited me and made me cancel another program. It was nine-thirty or ten by the time I was served dinner. The food was quite good – or so it seemed to my empty stomach. The servings were generously spiced with the Sahib’s apologies.</p>
		<p>It was nearly eleven by the time I finished dinner and went back to Dharma Rao’s house. “Were you eating all this time?” Dharma Rao asked in amazement. “It must have been quite a feast.”</p>
		<p>“An extraordinary meal,” I replied, “with papad, many types of pickles, great profusion of apologies, etc, etc. Mostly apologies and etceteras. Estimate at five minutes per item and you’ll see why it took so long. I know you have a good head for counting.”</p>
		<p>Dharma Rao looked puzzled but didn’t say anything. The next day V.N. Iyer himself related what happened to him.</p>
