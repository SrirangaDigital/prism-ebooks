		<p><strong><em>A young Amildar becomes the unwitting hero of a romantic farce. </em></strong></p>
		<p>Although there were many similarities between the people of Yedatore and Narsipur, the leaders of the two taluks differed in one important respect. In Yedatore, they would act in the open and show their feelings. In Narsipur, on the other hand, it was not uncommon for some leaders to weave a web of intrigue to get the official concerned to act in their favor or trap him. These could be amusing as long as someone else was the victim. I will illustrate this with a famous episode that had taken place a few years before I took charge.</p>
		<p>In the Narsipur taluk there is a large and prosperous village. (Its name is not needed here.) Its leader was its Patel, a wealthy man famous in these parts as a connoisseur of music and dance. We need not know his name; it suffices to know that he was a generous patron and promoter of artists, especially dancers. The leader of the rival party, as was usual in these parts was the Shanbog. The Amildar of the taluk at the time happened to be a comparatively young man, also fond of music and dance. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-022-01">1 </a></sup></p>
		<p>This prosperous village, actually a small town, was renowned as the nursery of performing artists, especially dancers. They were greatly in demand all over South India. Thanks to the patronage of wealthy art lovers, landowners, and even minor royalty, some of these women had attained to considerable wealth. This had made the village famous in the state of Mysore and even beyond. A good number of these talented women, it was said, owed their fame and fortune to the early patronage of the great Patel. This meant that the Patel, an extremely wealthy man, had at his disposal the resources to entertain influential visitors on a lavish scale. His fame had spread far and wide; his lifestyle was the envy of connoisseurs all around.</p>
		<p>His rival the Shanbog, a pedantic Brahmin, had neither the wealth nor the artistic and other resources to match the flamboyant Patel. But what he lacked in style and flair, he made up in cunning – or so his admirers claimed. When it came to wading his way through complicated government procedures, he was said to be without peer. His mastery was such that he could to clear the path for a friend or create obstacles to trip any adversary, or so the people believed. In addition, since most taluk office workers in those days were Brahmins, they used to be fed at his place whenever they happened to be in town at mealtime. This was the practice in those days. As a result, the Shanbog was well-informed about the goings on in the taluk office, and commanded considerable influence in its affairs. This at least was the image he had carefully cultivated, which may or may not have been true.</p>
		<p>In the inevitable division of the village, the Veerashaivas and their followers were with the Patel, while the Brahmins and the Kurubas were on the side of the Shanbog. Among the Harijans (Dalits) also there were two parties – the ‘Rightists’ and the ‘Leftists’; the former followed the Patel whereas the latter were followers of the Shanbog. Or it might have been the other way, I don’t exactly recall now. The episode that I am about to relate began as a minor dispute between the Rightists and the Leftists over the use of water from a lake or reservoir. But soon it acquired a life of its own. The Rightists were more numerous, but apprehensive that the case of the Leftists might be stronger, or at least more effectively presented to the Government by their leader, the Shanbog. Naturally they went to their leader, the Patel, and expressed their concern, especially their fear that the Shanbog might have more influence in the taluk office because of his close association with its workers.</p>
		<p>The Patel dismissed their concerns. The Shanbog’s contacts, he pointed out, were only clerks in the taluk office. They neither heard cases nor made decisions; they only wrote and reported what the Amildar told them. Let the Shanbog consort with these menials, the Patel would cultivate the Amildar himself. He, after all, had the resources, and, as luck would have it, the Amildar was a young man attracted to music and dance. It is worth noting that some Patels were descendants of feudal chiefs of an earlier era. For that reason they were regarded as noblemen, while the Shanbog enjoyed no such distinction; he was simply a professional, a government servant. The fact that this Patel had never put his hand to any useful work had served to enhance his standing as an aristocrat. He decided now to cultivate the Amildar.</p>
		<p>The Patel – an accomplished impresario – went about his task in his usual thorough manner. Whenever he visited the taluk headquarters, he would make it a point to call on the Amildar accompanied by an impressive retinue carrying gifts of fruits and flowers for the Amildar and his family. The Amildar in those days was not merely a government official but a ruler, the representative of the Maharaja. When the Amildar paid his first official visit to the Patel’s village, he made sure that nothing was amiss.</p>
		<p>As the Amildar reached the village, the Patel was waiting for him at the entrance in his capacity as the village chief greeting the king’s representative. He bowed to the Amildar as befitting a king’s subject, and then greeted him as a friend. After a lavish lunch at which all the town notables – including the Shanbog – were present, the Patel took the Amildar to a music and dance program specially arranged for him. The seating was so arranged that all could see the Patel in intimate conversation with the Amildar, no doubt discussing the finer points of the performance. It was a triumph.</p>
		<p>This was only the beginning. The Patel never failed to invite the Amildar to the numerous performances hosted by him. The Amildar was young, a connoisseur of the performing arts, but he was no fool. He saw through the Patel’s game and decided not to get involved in village politics. He made it known that he would not meet the Patel or any of his party except on official business and that too only at an official place. This was a blow to the Patel’s plans; but more seriously for a man of his temperament, it was a blow to his prestige and standing as a leader. To gain control over the Amildar, the Patel hatched an elaborate and daring plan.</p>
		<p>To follow the Patel’s plan, and how he went about implementing it, it is necessary to have an idea of the conditions under which the Amildar used to camp in that town. It had no Traveler’s Bungalow. There was, however, an old mansion that used to be the residence of the hereditary Ursu chieftains of the place, before the state was reorganized and the estate was absorbed into the Maharaja’s kingdom. The Ursu descendants had moved out and settled in Mysore. Their ancestral mansion had fallen into disrepair, but it was still a fine old building with a spacious and well-ventilated upstairs portion. Through its large windows, one could hear the music being played for the morning and evening service at the nearby temple. There was a stairway from the side door that led to a broad landing area, from which one entered the upstairs room or the living area. (This landing is important, please remember). All in all, it was a pleasant place which visiting Amildars used as lodgings, partly out of a sense of obligation towards its aristocratic owners.</p>
		<p>The episode I am about to relate took place while the Amildar was visiting the place during the annual jatra. The village had a famous and historic temple which came under the administration of the Government. So the Amildar was there on official work. The jatra used to attract visitors from all the nearby taluks including Mysore, Nanjangud, Chamarajnagar, Yelandur, and others. The highlight of the jatra was a public performance given by the musicians and dancers of the place, many of whom had gained fame and fortune in all parts of South India. It was their annual homecoming.</p>

		<p>The Amildar was also in town, as just noted, on official duty to supervise security, supplies, and other arrangements. There was at the time, a celebrated violinist living in that village. His name was Malavalli Subbanna (I am not giving out the name of the place by naming him, for he lived at many other places.)<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-022-02">2</a></sup>I think I have heard all the great violinists and musicians of South India, in their prime, over the past sixty years.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-022-03">3 </a></sup>In my experience, the number of instrumental musicians who could equal Malavalli Subbanna in virtuosity, taste, and brilliance can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The immortal Veena Seshanna, and perhaps the violinists Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu and our own T. Chowdaiah could be compared to him. In Subbanna’s hands the violin became a living thing – with a truly magical tone – and a power of expression that could cast a spell on any audience. I still recall what the great Vasudevachar once said to me about him,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-022-04">4 </a></sup>“Poor bastard! He never had any luck; a God-given talent, fingers that can bring out a golden sound, and a vagabond’s life.”</p>
		<p>In any event, at the jatra in question, the major program was a recital with Subbanna accompanying a well-known singer – one of the Patel’s favorites. It was said to be a brilliant concert. The Amildar complimented Subbanna.</p>
		<p>“Wonderful performance, Subbanna! You excelled yourself today. We should arrange for you to come and play at my place sometime. By the way, who is the singer? She is also very good.”</p>
		<p>“Whatever I play is the result of my Guru’s blessings and your patronage. Let me know when you want me to play, I’ll be at your service. The lady – she’s the Patel’s mistress. She’s from Mysore – studying with Veena Subbanna.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-022-05">5 </a></sup></p>
		<p>Soon after the concert, in the coming days, the Amildar began to notice a distinct change in the public’s attitude towards him. People would avoid his eyes and put on a forced expression of blank innocence whenever his eyes fell on them. Gone was the customary deferential attitude that he was used to and expected as the Maharaja’s official. In its place he sensed a secretiveness mixed with amusement. Overnight the Amildar seemed to have turned into a comical figure. At the same time the Patel’s attentions seemed to increase, while his relationship with the Shanbog began to show signs of coolness. The normally cordial Shanbog now treated him with stiff formality bordering on indifference.</p>
		<p>The situation seemed to be getting worse by the day. One morning, as he was going around the town for his usual rounds, he happened to notice a bevy of young women – some of the musicians and dancers of the town – on the balcony of their local residence. As soon as his gaze fell on them, there were peals of laughter as the girls disappeared into the house. The Amildar was profoundly distressed by this open show of disrespect. How was he to uphold the dignity of his high office, as the king’s official, when the subjects regarded him like this?</p>
		<p>(“Why did he have to look at them?” one may ask. Well, why not? Was he supposed go on his village rounds blindfolded?)</p>
		<p>The Amildar was puzzled and depressed by all this, but also intrigued. He knew something must have happened to bring about this abrupt change and was curious to know what it was. How to get to the bottom of the affair? A few days later, the mystery unraveled on its own, revealing an extraordinary story. It began with the violinist’s visit to Narsipur in connection with the arrangements for the concert requested by the Amildar. Subbanna presented himself before the Amildar and asked, “You wanted me to play for you and your friends,” the violinist reminded. “When do you want it to be?”</p>
		<p>The Amildar gave a date telling him that several of his friends from Mysore – all music lovers – would be present.</p>
		<p>“Do you want it to be a solo recital?” Subbanna asked. “If some visiting friends are going to be there, why not have a singer also?”</p>
		<p>Subbanna’s voice was not exactly fit for a public performance. So the Amildar asked, “Whom do you suggest?”</p>
		<p>“Who else my lord?” said Subbanna, assuming a tone of mock humility, “The same woman who entertained you at the jatra; for whom you showed such admiration and affection.”</p>
		<p>“Mind your language!” shouted the Amildar in indignation. “All I said was that she sang well. Just because I treat you with regard as a great artist don’t take liberties with me! Consider my position!”</p>
		<p>“I am sorry my lord,” the violinist replied. “I am only repeating what the people of the village are saying. The Patel is going around claiming that he has you in the palm of his hand – that you’ll do whatever he tells you. The Shanbog is saying that you have fallen into the Patel’s trap.”</p>
		<p>The Amildar was disturbed. He guessed that Subbanna must have come to him at the Shanbog’s prodding, using the recital as a pretext. On his own he wouldn’t have dared speaking to the Amildar in that fashion.</p>
		<p>“Having told me this much,” said the Amildar, “why don’t you tell me the whole story; don’t hold anything back.”</p>
		<p>“The story I hear is,” Subbanna continued, “that you had the woman visit you the night following the recital. The Patel sent her to you, they say. The temple manager escorted her to your lodgings. Having gotten wind of it, several men from the Shanbog’s party were hiding just outside the place and saw her go in.”</p>
		<p>“What nonsense!” the Amildar retorted. “I was sleeping in the upstairs room. My servants, my orderly, they were all downstairs near the entrance. Also, I always keep the bedroom door locked at night. She couldn’t have got into my room.”</p>
		<p>“Is the bedroom door such an impregnable barrier?” asked Subbanna, controlling himself with great difficulty. “Is it so hard to leave it unlocked when expecting such a visitor? Would any servant dare stop a woman visiting their master at night? Anyway, it is no business of mine. I’ll arrange the concert as you wish.”</p>
		<p>After Subbanna left, the Amildar sent for his personal orderly, one Dafedar Shaja Hussain, and asked him about the night. The poor fellow, scared out his wits, gave the following account: “The Patel came to me and said, ‘Hussain Sahib, tonight is a special night for your master. You should send away the whole staff and be alone on duty for the night. Someone dear to him will be coming to visit him. You should send her up without a word, without any noise.’ ”</p>
		<p>“It is an outrage!” shouted the Amildar. “Why didn’t you ask me?”</p>
		<p>“How could I?” Shaja Hussain pleaded. “Who could imagine the Patel to have such nerve; to lie to me about your lordship. I assumed it was your wish.”</p>
		<p>“Then what happened?”</p>
		<p>“At about eleven or so, a young woman came accompanied by the temple manager. I let her in. I saw her go up the stairs. Then I went back and sat in the front yard, waiting for her to come back. She came out about an hour later and left with the temple manager who was waiting for her at the temple across the street.”</p>
		<p>“Did you recognize her?”</p>
		<p>“I could see her face clearly in the night lantern by the door.”</p>
		<p>The Amildar sent for the temple manager Venkatappa on some pretext and asked him about the night. He said that the Patel had enlisted his help with the same story that he had given the orderly.</p>
		<p>The poor Amildar had become the unwitting hero in a romantic comedy. A mystery still remained. What was the woman doing? This was finally revealed by the woman herself following her break with the Patel, engineered by the rival faction. The Patel had told her to just go up the stairs and spend an hour or two sitting or sleeping in the landing leading to the Amildar’s bedroom, and then go back to her place. The Patel had promised her a diamond nose ring for her trouble. The poor Amildar was fast asleep in the bedroom, knowing nothing of the elaborate farce being enacted around him.</p>
		<p>The Shanbog’s party, now joined by the woman, rapidly spread the story. This discredited the Patel. There was a groundswell of sympathy for the Amildar mixed with some amusement. The Patel had lost his swagger, but he was not the kind to give up easily. He now floated a story claiming that the woman had gone to the Amildar on her own initiative.</p>
		<p>“When I learnt of this,” the Patel boasted, “I kicked that slut out. Am I a eunuch to be cuckolded by some Amildar?"</p>
		<p>The Amildar bided his time and took his revenge on the Patel.</p>
		<p>This story, still quite recent, had become part of the local folklore by the time I came to Narsipur as Amildar. Most of the participants were still around. I was not involved in anything so dramatic, but there was one instance where a similar plan was tried on me. It came about as follows.</p>
		<p>There used to be a wealthy cloth merchant in Narsipur. (Let him remain anonymous.) One day, he paid me an unexpected visit and asked me with great diffidence, “Did you send Venkatappa [not the real name] to order some clothes?”</p>
		<p>I was surprised.</p>
		<p>“Of course not. Why would I send a man like him when I have my own servants? This sounds strange. Please tell me the whole thing. I want to get to the bottom of it.”</p>
		<p>He gave me the following account.</p>
		<p>“Venkatappa came to my place and said, ‘I have to tell you something in secret.’ ‘What is it?’ I asked him. ‘It’s the Subedar’s wish,’ Venkatappa said. ‘He wants you to select a Dharmavaram sari in the 4045-rupee range and charge it to his account. He’ll send you the money after the first.’ I was surprised. ‘Where was the need to send you?’ I asked. ‘There are good reasons,’ he said. ‘Can’t you guess? He wants to give it to someone for the Gowri festival. What business is it of ours?’ I became suspicious. If he wanted it sent to “someone”, the Amildar would have sent me the money. Would he send such a seedy character and ask to put it on his account? I wondered. I kept my doubts to myself and told him, ‘I understand, but I am out of stock. Come back in a couple of days. But who is it for?’ He laughed. ‘Why bother? But be sure to have it by the Gowri festival.’ I then told him, ‘All right, come back in a few days. There are still six days before the festival. I should have the stock by then. If I don’t receive it by then I’ll buy it from some other merchant. But it is better if the person herself comes to my shop and selects the sari’.</p>
		<p>“ ‘No, absolutely not!’ Venkatappa said. ‘There is no way she can be seen coming to your shop. The Subedar will be furious.’ ‘What is the problem?’ I asked. ‘All the respectable ladies in town come and shop at my place. Why, even the Subedar’s wife comes here.’ ‘If it were the Subedar’s wife,’ Venkatappa said, ‘there would be no problem. You want to know who it is’ – and whispered the name of a prostitute in Moogur. ‘It is all right,’ I told him. ‘The stock will be at my home. She can come there and select in private. She doesn’t have to come to the shop.’”</p>
		<p>The merchant completed his story and looked at me expectantly, as if he still had some doubt that I might have sent Venkatappa to him. Otherwise, he would have told Venkatappa to bring a written order from me.</p>
		<p>This Venkatappa was a disreputable character – a go-between for illicit affairs and worse. His plan must have been to entangle me in a case by producing a receipt from the merchant for a sari purchased for the Moogur prostitute. That woman was known to belong to the party of a leader from that town.</p>
		<p>I thanked the merchant and told him to alert the police if Venkatappa or the woman should approach him on my behalf. Neither of them did. I myself punished Venkatappa suitably. During the investigation he admitted that he was acting on behalf of the leader from Moogur.</p>
