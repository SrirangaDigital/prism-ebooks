		<p><strong><em>The Kaveri and the Kabini and the adventures they spawned. Digression on Tippu Sultan. A drunken man and a miserly trader saved from drowning. A resourceful boatman saves the day. </em></strong></p>
		<p>The two rivers, Kaveri and the Kabini, and their confluence at the sacred site of Tirumakudlu, serve as the backdrop to most of my memories of T. Narsipur. I have traveled extensively both in India and Europe, and have visited many famous and picturesque places. But for reasons that probably have to do with my youthful vigor and exuberance, nothing I have seen or known can compare with the beauty of Narsipur or the joyfulness of my experiences there. The Kaveri, with her sacred waters, is inseparably bound with these experiences. I had become her devotee long before I set my eyes upon her. By the time I knew English well enough to read and understand, I got hold of an English textbook called ‘Bradshaw’s V Reader’.</p>
		<p>How can I describe my joy? It opened a whole new world before me. I felt like Keats on reading Chapman’s Homer.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-01">1 </a></sup>I can still remember some of the lessons in it – Pope’s ‘Universal Prayer’, Wolfe’s ‘Burial of Sir John Moore’, Hood’s ‘Eugene Aram’, Lamb’s ‘Adventures of Ulysses’— but above all an essay called ‘Course of an Indian River’. I cannot now recall the name of its author but it left an indelible impression on my young mind. The Indian River was our own Kaveri. I devoured them all, especially the ‘Course of an Indian River’.</p>
		<p>In a wonderfully evocative essay, the author describes how the Great Lady, rising in Coorg, flows into Mysore, sanctifies everything in her path by turning Ramanathapuram, Hanasoge, Chunchan Katte, Yedatore, Srirangapatnam, Sosale, Gargeshawari, Narsipur, Madapura, Mudukutore, and Talkad into places of pilgrimage. Then she leaps over the cataract of Shivanasamudram to enter the lowlands of Madras, bringing sanctity and prosperity to the province.</p>
		<p>He brought before my young eyes the grand history of places like Srirangapatnam and Shivasamudram – by describing the rise and fall of their kingdoms and rulers. Describing the last heroic days of Tippu Sultan he wrote <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-02">2 </a></sup>“This powerful ruler met his end at the hands of an anonymous soldier. His glory and ambition burst like a bubble – remaining only to point a moral or adorn a tale.”</p>
		<img src="images/0043.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>As I remember, I saw the Kaveri for the first time in 1888, from the window of a railway compartment during my first train journey to Mysore. By then I had also read Philip Meadows Taylor’s Tippu Sultan. From Hirode<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-03">3 </a></sup>onwards, my journey was occupied in imagining that history. I saw in my imagination the fierce firangis attacking Srirangapatnam fort, with the brave warrior betrayed by the very men he had raised to high position. I saw him fall, fighting a hopeless battle, deserted by all but a handful of devoted soldiers. What a fall there was, my countrymen!</p>
		<p>In my boyhood days, whenever I came across an elderly Muslim, I used to imagine that his grandfather might have been a soldier or officer in Tippu’s army. I used to be a great admirer of Tippu in those days. He was born in Devanahalli, my own ancestral place. I had seen also the housing complex where he was born.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-04">4 </a></sup>Tippu to me was the gentle Muslim, destroyed by the cannons of my hated enemies – the firangi. Today, many years later, my views about both Tippu and the firangi may have undergone some change, but have not entirely disappeared. ‘The thoughts of youth are long thoughts’. As a result, Tippu to me is still a hero, while the firangi, except for a handful of exceptions, are monsters.</p>
		<p>To return to the river geography, strictly speaking, Tirumakudlu or the junction—which literally means ‘tri-junction’ – is different from Narsipur though they are often regarded as one and the same.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-05">5 </a></sup>The Kabini flows between Narsipur and Tirumakudlu. The famous temple sits on the triangle formed by the two rivers. Today (1952) there are two bridges near T. Narsipur – one spanning the Kaveri and the other the Kabini. The Kabini Bridge leads to the road going south, leading to Moogur, Chamarajnagar, and Kollegal. The Kaveri Bridge carries the road going north and east – to Sosale, Malavalli, Bannur, Belakawadi, Shivanasamudra, and other places. These bridges did not exist during the days I am writing about. The rivers were not fordable five to six months in the year, so people had to be ferried across in boats and rafts. The contract rights for running the ferry service were awarded on the basis of bids at an auction. I found this was unsatisfactory and led to poor service: being poor, skilled watermen rarely had the money to make successful bids, while the men who had the capital were interested only in squeezing the maximum profit out of it. After taking over as Amildar I slightly modified the procedure. After checking previous records, I made the auction procedure little more than a formality by fixing the rates so that the boatmen received a decent income without making the service too expensive for the passengers.</p>
		<p>“We have to spend all day in the water my lord,” the boatmen told me. “We need some concession in the price of liquor also to keep us going.” I found their request to be reasonable. I brought together the liquor contractors and the boatmen and arranged a mutually agreeable price. Of course, the liquor contractors had an interest, for they could not transport their goods without the ferry service during the high season. And the boatmen also could not do without liquor. So it was easy to get the parties to agree on reasonable terms.</p>
		<p>I have many memories relating to the rivers. Even though they were fordable for roughly half the year, flash floods due to sudden rains were always a threat even in the dry season. Then the river would rise without warning. I recall one such instance when I was crossing the Kaveri on horseback. As I was hurrying towards the bank, I saw a Sosale Kulawadi man standing in a puddle in the river, absolutely motionless. The water was beginning to rise on both sides of the river, but the man would not move either forward or backward.</p>
		<p>“Come this side or go back, don’t stand in the middle,” I called out to him.</p>
		<p>“I can’t my lord!” he shouted back. “I can’t see a thing.”</p>
		<p>“Why, are you blind?” I asked him. “Shouldn’t you have brought someone to go with you? You could lose your life.”</p>
		<p>“Not blind my lord, drunk. I can’t see a thing.”</p>

		<p>“You bastard! Just stay there, don’t move,” I told him. “I’ll send someone to get you.”</p>
		<p>After reaching shore, I sent him my trumpeter to fetch him and take him home.</p>
		<p>I recall another highly amusing incident, which still makes me laugh whenever I think of it. This was during the sacred season, when the five Shiva temples of Talkad – or pancha linga – are visited by pilgrims from all around. People coming from Kollegal have to cross the river near a place known as Malangi. On this occasion, water started rising, but the flow of pilgrims continued. It takes a little while to get the ferry service going.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-06">6 </a></sup>I had marked a safe path for crossing with a line of bamboo posts manned by policemen and other taluk workers. For some unknown reason, a ‘Shetty’ from Kollegal decided to take a different, unmarked route more or less parallel to the marked route but away from it. Perhaps he was worried that someone might ask him for a tip. The current seized him and dragged him into the water. As he was struggling to come out, waging a losing battle against the river, a police constable in full uniform, jumped in after him and dragged him ashore with great difficulty and at considerable risk to himself.</p>
		<p>Naturally a report was to be filed as part of the police record. The constable, the police inspector, and the Shetty came to my bungalow to report. The inspector spoke highly of the constable’s heroism and said, “Though hampered by his boots, belt and other paraphernalia of his police uniform, Constable Kempa, at great risk to himself saved this man’s life. But this ungrateful fellow has brought a complaint against Kempa because he asked for a small tip.”</p>
		<p>“You must hear my side also, my lord,” pleaded the Shetty. “He asked me for a tip of five rupees just because he pulled me out of the water. Is there no justice? Does he think that money grows on trees? Did I ask him to pull me out? He dragged my out on his own, without my permission. Sir, you are a judge. Please let everyone know what I am saying is fair.”</p>
		<p>I could barely control my sense of outrage and also amusement. He no doubt thought he was being very clever.</p>
		<p>“Of course you are right! Don’t worry, I’ll teach him a lesson.” I told him. “Kempa, you fool! Why did you save this poor man from drowning without first asking his permission? Couldn’t you mind your own business? Take this man back into the river – and leave him exactly where you found him. Isn’t that a fair ruling, sir?”</p>
		<p>It might have been a fair ruling, but the trader from Kollegal didn’t seem to relish the idea of going back into the river. Nobody believed he wanted to go back anyway. A local merchant, also a Shetty, said, “Your conduct is a disgrace to our whole community. Will you pay up or not? I’ll pay this brave fellow if you can’t.”</p>
		<p>The Kollegal Shetty tearfully pulled out two rupees from his pocket and tried to pay his saviour. The policeman declined and said, “No sir, your soul is not worth that much. If you want to reward me according to your worth, just pay me three pice.” Here was a philosopher in police uniform!</p>
		<p>Everyone laughed. We took out a subscription and gave Kempa ten rupees as a gift acknowledging his bravery. It included three tear-soaked rupees from the trader from Kollegal.</p>
		<p>I have many other memories of the Kaveri. During my student days, I used to spend my holidays in Mirley where my dear uncle, Ananda Tirtha Rao, used to camp.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-07">7 </a></sup>He was then an assistant engineer in the Mysore service. The river is about two and a half miles from the town of Mirley. One morning I left home at six for a long brisk walk through the woods reaching the river around eight or half past eight. By then it had turned quite warm and I was sweating profusely from the exertion. The clear water, gushing between the rocks, with overhanging tree branches looked highly enticing. Egrets and other water birds nesting along the trees lining the banks were flying around making their characteristic noise adding greatly to the enchantment.</p>
		<p>In short, the scene before me was idyllic. I could not resist getting into the water. I had not brought my swimming trunks. Since no one seemed to be around, I removed my clothes, left them on the bank with a rock atop and got into the water in the state that the Good Lord created me. In my exhilaration, I lost sense of time until the exertion of the morning walk and a couple of hours of swimming made me feel hungry. As I swam back to get my clothes I noticed that the riverside was no longer deserted. I saw a family of my acquaintance seated not far from where I had left my clothes. I waited for a while, but they seemed to be in no hurry to leave. Their lunch baskets suggested that they were there for the long haul. The sight of the lunch baskets only increased my appetite. It seemed they were waiting for me to come out of the water so they could enjoy the river. They had of course no way of knowing that I was in my natural state. It was simply the best spot for miles and they wanted to enjoy it.</p>
		<p>I kept wondering how on earth I was going to come out. Then a thought struck me. Like Archimedes in a similar situation, I too cried “Eureka”! And like him, I solved my problem without the help of teachers or assistants.</p>
		<p>“Shyama,” I called out a small boy who was with the family. “Could you please pick up those clothes on the bank, and leave them on the other side of the rocks by bushes over there?”</p>
		<p>He was a good boy. He didn’t giggle or try to be clever by telling me, “Why don’t you do it yourself.” He obediently followed my instructions, though there was a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. I came out of the water, put on my clothes and made myself scarce, without stopping to greet the family. Being a teenager, I was too embarrassed to see them. The story got home, suitably embellished. It was the cause of much merriment, and I too had the pleasure of knowing that I was the cause of their mirth.</p>
		<p>In these parts, so lavishly adorned with rivers, a non-swimmer is a depraved being. Not enjoying boat rides is a crime. At least thrice a week, I used to go to the rocks by the temple of Moolasthaneshwara and enjoy swimming in its deep waters. Like many others present there, I used to offer my sandhya-vandana and then worship at the Shiva temple. This brought me much praise from Smarthas and the Veerashaivas, who thought me an admirably devout soul with one only vice – smoking. The Shrivaishnavas on the other hand, were disdainful.</p>
		<p>“He is supposed to be a Madhva (Vaishnava)!” some of them sneered. “What sort of a Madhva is he? Worshipping at a Shiva temple, instead of the Vishnu temple of Gunja Narasimhaswamy? Why wear urdhva pundra? Let him wear sacred ash instead.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-08">8 </a></sup></p>
		<p>After I got wind of these remarks, I made it a point to go and visit the Gunja Narasimhaswamy temple also. This made everyone happy. Their offerings of appetizing prasad, if not the worship, seemed to increase my devotion.</p>
		<p>I grew to be very fond of the boatmen of the taluk. They were mostly poor but brave and hardworking. I can illustrate their courage and resourcefulness with a story.</p>
		<p>One afternoon, towards the end of the summer, a large number of women, children, and elderly people from Narsipur had gone to the Tirumakudlu temple on the banks of the Kabini. I do not remember the occasion; it was either a Hari Katha or some other religious function at the Agastyeshwara temple. Only the children who had gone to school and the men who had gone to work remained on the other bank. There</p>

			</figure>	
		<p>was soon a thunderstorm followed by a downpour. The result was a flash flood. The river turned into a raging torrent and rose by several feet in a matter of hours. It began to get dark, and the weather also turned stormy. Nearly half the population of Narsipur – mostly women, children and the elderly – was marooned on the far side of the river. As it was still the dry season, a couple of weeks before the rains were expected, the boats were in storage in different parts of the river. Some of them had probably been lost in the sudden flood. In any event, it would take several days to get them ready.</p>
		<p>This was the situation when several workers came to my office and reported the story with alarm. I had to find some way of dealing with the crisis; it was my responsibility as Amildar. The river was still rising with little possibility of the floods subsiding that evening. I sent for the chiefs of the boatmen from nearby places like Narsipur, Alagod, and others and asked them to help me.</p>
		<p>“What to do my lord, there are no boats,” said most of them. “If at least we had a few rafts, we could do something.” They gave a vivid description of the heroic feats they could perform if only they had boats and rafts.</p>
		<p>This was too much for Hotte Mada – Mada the Potbellied – an old boatman whose memory went back seven decades. “You worthless bastards!” he yelled at them, using swearwords that cast aspersions on their ancestry going back several generations. “Are you sons of Mother Ganga or measly cowards?” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-09">9 </a></sup></p>
		<p>“Listen to this old man my lord!” he said turning to me. “In the days of the Great Maharaja, there was a similar mad flood.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-10">10 </a></sup>I was then a small boy – only this high.” He indicated a height of about three feet. “My father, Meesey Manta Nayaka, was the chief of boatmen then.” (The name means Manta Nayaka of the Big Moustache)</p>
		<p>“He was a real man,” the old man continued. “He ruled three wives. He drank three seers of liquor. He was not like today’s effeminate softies, sitting around and crying ‘What to do?’ He got hold of all the empty cans and drums and bamboo in town and built rafts to ferry people across the river. Why don’t we do the same?”</p>
		<p>The rest of the boatmen agreed that it was a good idea. Their enthusiasm doubled when I told them that they could have all the liquor they could handle after finishing the job. I then sent word to the local construction depot and got hold of all the rope, bamboo, and empty kerosene cans that we could find. We then soldered the empty cans so that they would float, and my taluk workers and the boatmen somehow managed to put together four rafts. I also had brought four or five kerosene lanterns from local traders and other lamps from the town temples. I sent the rafts across the river to Tirumakudlu. I myself went over to the other bank riding on the first raft.</p>
		<p>Crossing the river in the dark, windy night, on these makeshift rafts could be quite hazardous. Unless absolutely essential, there was no need expose the women and children to the risk of the crossing. I made arrangements for food, lodgings, and warm blankets for the women and children forced to spend the night in Tirumakudlu. Those men – mostly old men – willing to travel on the rafts were ferried across. Mainly it was to let people on the other side of the river know that their family members were safe and looked after. The rafts had to make several trips carrying food for them. Of course, the boatmen did not go to sleep until their thirst was fully-quenched. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-11">11 </a></sup></p>
		<p>How can I describe in words the grandeur of the place when the rivers were in full spate? Following a west-to-east course, the Kabini joins the Kaveri, then flowing in a north-to-south direction. The two rivers, becoming one at the holy site of Tirumakudlu, sanctify the towns of Mudukutore and Talakad by endowing them with a share of the blessings of the sacred confluence. The Kaveri then flows along a broad expanse, lined on either side by fertile villages and prosperous towns filled with lush green fields and tall palms and trees as far as the eye can see. I may lack the literary skills to describe the beauty of the place, but I think I have enjoyed her blessings as much as anyone I know.</p>
		<p>Some boatmen told me that M.G. Krishnaswamy Rao, who had served before me as Amildar of Narsipur, once travelled the distance to Mudukutore by boat following the course of the flood. In those days he was something of a legend in these parts. I knew him by fame before I came to know him as a friend. I was determined to equal or better his feat. Ignoring the advice of friends and elders, I dashed to Mudukutore when the river was in spate, covering the distance of about ten miles in less than two hours by taking advantage of the current.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-12">12 </a></sup>How can I describe my feeling of exhilaration? Although I was not known to be free with my subordinates, I relaxed and spent the two hours joking with the Shirastedar, the police Jamedar and others who seemed or pretended to be scared. I told them how on one occasion, Rajaji and I, while students in Madras, had gone some five or six miles into the sea with some fishermen. Learning that the Shekadar knew some devotional songs, I persuaded him to sing a few. The poor soul delivered them in a voice shaking with cold, and possibly fear, which I praised. After touching Mudukutore, I thanked the boatmen and gave each a tip of two rupees. (Two rupees those days was a lot of money when people raised families on one rupee a day. It could buy ten seers of rice, and more importantly, enough country liquor to fill a bathtub)</p>
		<p>I went to the Mallikarjuna temple that night and offered service; I had great difficulty in getting the village priest to correctly pronounce the royal blessing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-023-13">13 </a></sup>I spent the night at the small inspection lodge at Mudukutore. I also sent a note to my family so they knew that I had completed the trip safely.</p>
		<p>After this experience, whenever possible, my family and I used to make our trips to Mudukutore by boat. It was quicker and also far more enjoyable than traveling by road. Although the novelty of the boat trip soon wore off, the enjoyment never did. Our trips were not entirely without incident. I recall two in particular. On the first occasion, when our boat was about four or five miles from Narsipur, there was a sudden thunderstorm. The river became choppy and the waves began to toss the boat around. The boatmen began to lose control of the boat. Even the boatmen became concerned – let alone the poor passengers. I told the boatmen to somehow take the boat to the near shore to a village called Musukina-koppa. They did so with great difficulty and skill. In that downpour, we reached the village safely and went to the house of the Hegde, requesting him to put us up for the night.</p>
		<p>The Hegde proved to be a large-hearted man. He lived in a magnificent new mansion with a covered courtyard in the middle. He treated us to a sumptuous meal and gave me his own bedroom for the night. It was a huge, lavishly furnished room, with life size nude pictures of foreign women from Germany. It had also an unusual bed made of costly rosewood, with brass fittings and reinforcements. Apparently no expense had been spared in making it commodious and luxurious. A singular feature was the three-foot high mirror that surrounded it like a wall. Anyone sleeping in that bed could enjoy watching himself in the mirror all around. With our host the Hegde, his physical appearance was not as beautiful as his heart. His was a burly, nearly black body overgrown with hair all over to such a degree that the word hirsute is inadequate to describe it. I wondered if he took delight in watching it in all four directions. Or perhaps, his partner who shared the bed with him was an object that he never tired watching, and he wanted to enhance the pleasure fourfold.</p>
		<p>We enjoyed the Hegde’s hospitality for the night and continued our journey to Mudukutore in the morning. In my experience, the Hegde’s of this region are simple and generous but proud people. They are not as sophisticated or worldly as the Vokkaligas, nor arrogant like the Veerashaivas.</p>
		<p>I recall another incident a couple of years earlier when I was still Amildar of Yedatore. I was on foot at the time, and lost my way in the blowing rain near a place called Hulle-Bore-Kaval. After wandering around in the dark for a long time, I found a light where a small group of Kurubas were camped for the night. Approaching them, I asked them if anyone could show me the way to Hosa-Agrahara, which was my destination. One of them agreed, asking me to wait a while so he could finish his supper. He folded his shoulder blanket, which he placed on the ground, offering it to me as a seat. He then brought me a pot of boiling hot sheep’s milk. It had a peculiar pungent odor that put me off. I could not drink it. When he saw this, his face fell. I then smelt some garlic as someone seemed to be preparing some rasam. I asked him if I could have some of it, which I could mix with the milk to mask its odor. With extreme hesitation he told me that it was also prepared with the same milk. He brought me some in a cup prepared with a leaf. It was excellent – or at least seemed so because I was so hungry.</p>
		<p>I have many more memories associated with rivers going back to those days, but these should give an idea of the delights.</p>
