		<p><strong><em>The SDO discourses on his theories about philosophy and science. Memories of a former Diwan. Meeting an astrologer of amazing talent. </em></strong></p>
		<p>Within a few days of taking charge as Amildar of T. Narsipur, I was graced by the visit of the subdivision officer (SDO) on the occasion of the ‘huzur jamabandi’. Having camped in Santemara-Halli for jamabandi in Chamarajnagar taluk, he came to Narsipur via Moogur. The Amildar of Chamarajnagar was Venkataramana Shrauti, a personal friend of mine. I attended the banquet at Santemara-Halli given in the SDO’s honor at the conclusion of the jamabandi. The SDO was Vaidya Natha Iyer (V.N. Iyer) whom we have already met in Najanagud. I did not know him particularly well at the time. I have previously related my misadventure in connection with his dinner invitation which he had forgotten.</p>
		<p>I asked my friend Shrauti about how to deal with the SDO. To me he seemed a strange character – almost a throwback to an earlier century, and nearly twice my age. I wanted to make sure that the work went smoothly and also I wouldn’t say or do anything that might hurt the old man’s feelings. Shrauti smiled and said, “He won’t cause you any trouble. He knows you’re the deputy commissioner’s (DC) favorite Amildar. He is also slightly afraid of you – what with your reputation for a fiery temper. Still he is a strange man – almost like a child in many ways. He will say thoughtless things without meaning any harm; without the slightest notion that it might hurt others. I don’t have to spell it out. You’ll see for yourself soon enough.”</p>
		<p>I did see soon enough, at the reception itself that had been organized with utmost care by Shrauti. It was a grand occasion with a photographer and a sumptuous banquet for lunch. It was close to two in the afternoon by the time we sat down for lunch. There were frequent servings of coffee and small eats, so most of us did not notice the delay.</p>
		<p>But the SDO, V.N. Iyer, was very orthodox and strict in his observances and never put anything in his mouth without going through an elaborate prayer and ritual. So he was extremely hungry by the time we sat down for lunch. Like most elderly men, he had also reached the end of his patience because of the hunger. (Now in my old age, I know this to be natural. I did not know it at the time.)</p>
		<p>Shrauti led the SDO Sahib to the head of the banquet, to the seat prepared for him. “I must apologize,” said Shrauti, “it is a bit late.”</p>
		<p>“So it has finally dawned you that it’s late,” the Sahib retorted. “Your watch had stopped perhaps.”</p>
		<p>I did not expect such behavior from someone for whom the banquet had been arranged. One hears of such behavior from the legendary Sage Durvasa, and from some critics who habitually receive free food at charitable places and who feel they have a right to criticize everything. But I had never before seen anything like this from a person of V.N. Iyer’s position.</p>
		<p>This was only the beginning. We sat down for lunch. I have already noted that the SDO was very strict in observing religious rites. Food had to be served in a particular order. Rice and ghee had to be served first and the rest only after he had said his pranahuti. The poor fellows serving lunch – some local Brahmin cooks – knew nothing of all this. They simply followed the local practice of serving rice followed by a helping of dal. The Sahib was furious. He got up and went after the serving boy as though he wanted to hit him.</p>
		<p>“You bloody bastard!” the SDO Sahib shouted. “Don’t you know better than to serve dal before pranahuti. After I have said pranahuti – serve dal or serve amdehya, for all I care.”</p>
		<p>Literally amedhya means food unfit for offering to the Gods; it can also mean excreta. The SDO obviously meant it in the latter sense. It never occurred to him that the rest of the world might not be as knowledgeable about these niceties. I felt sorry for my friend Shrauti as he went on to remove the old leaf on which the offending serving had been made and had a new leaf laid. This time, the food was served strictly according to the SDO’s instructions.</p>
		<p>From all this, the reader can see that SDO V.N. Iyer was not exactly an engaging personality. He began my taluk jamabandi at Moogur, and made his way through the taluk stopping at some of the important towns. He was not a diligent official. A few veteran clerks practically ran his office. With their help, the jamabandi ran smoothly, as did the usual formalities relating to supplies, food, and the evening durbar. But I found it advisable to caution his clerks who seemed to be a law unto themselves.</p>
		<p>“I am not going to tolerate any harassment of my staff in the villages or at any level,” I told them. “If I hear of any attempts by you to extract bribes from citizens, you will be tried in my court. I am not going to spy on you or come in the way of the usual hospitality that is your due as government servants. The main thing is I don’t want to hear any complaints.”</p>
		<p>They took my warning seriously and I had no trouble with them.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-01">1</a></sup> This was not the only problem I had to deal with. The Sahib could not ride. He was unused to walking also. His age and health made it hard for him cover long distances on foot. As a result, most of his rounds had to be in ox-carts. I was not used to riding in them. So I followed him on horseback. No matter where he stayed, most of the morning was taken up with his religious activities, leaving him little time for official work. By the time he was finished it would be time for lunch.</p>
		<p>“The Sahib cannot eat anything cooked in oil,” his assistant had told the supply officer. “It gives him a bad cold. All food must be prepared with pure butter and ghee. If he comes down with cold, he knows immediately that oil has been used.”</p>
		<p>Of course, none of us complained about the arrangement. As a result, even those like me who lacked the Sahib’s special sensitivity benefited from the arrangement.</p>
		<p>I have mentioned previously that SDO V.N. Iyer owed his position in the Government to his family connection, as the brother-in-law of the famous Diwan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer. He told me several interesting things about the great man’s early life. I can still recall a few. It appears that as a boy, Seshadri Iyer was not active like a normal child. He used to stop playing with other children and stand all by himself, totally lost to the world. His father believed Seshadri to be the dullest of his children. He was concerned about the boy, believing that his other children would somehow be able to take care of themselves. Once a famous astrologer from Malabar (Kerala) visited them for lunch and read the palms of all the children. He told the father that Seshadri would rise to high position and attain great fame.</p>
		<img src="images/0046.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Thefatherlaughedat thisand then sighed.“Heisaverygoodboy,”hetold thepalmist,“butadullard.Atleast,letyourblessingsbringhimahappylife.”</p>
		<p>V.N. Iyer also told me that Seshadri Iyer had great faith in astrology. He had his detailed horoscope drawn, with all the predictions, and stored it in a safe. Apparently he had only once shown it to V.N. Iyer. Seshadri Iyer firmly believed that his wife’s devotion to God and her saintly qualities were responsible for his own eminence. He held her in utmost respect, bordering on reverence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-02">2 </a></sup></p>
		<p>On the basis of his horoscope, the Diwan believed that he would be blessed with fame and happiness as long as his wife lived, and unhappiness would visit him after her death. His horoscope had apparently predicted the year of his death also. He was shattered by his wife’s death. When his wife died he told his intimates, “All light has gone out of my life.” He had deep faith in Vedanta. Sir William Hunter once said of Seshadri Iyer: “He has devoted his intellect to Herbert Spencer, and his heart to Parabrahman.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-03">3 </a></sup></p>
		<p>Seshadri Iyer had great reverence for Sri Sri Narasimha Bharati, then Pontiff of the Sringeri Mutt. I know this from first hand evidence. When as Diwan he might have been excused for thinking that he had the world at his feet, he sent a humble letter to the Pontiff through his representative Srikantha Shastri. My friend Dasappa of Belavadi showed me a copy of it. The Diwan, in his letter, after describing the successful completion of several of his programs, appealed to the Pontiff (through Srikantha Shastri):</p>
		<p>“I have not the slightest doubt that the success of these schemes is due entirely to the blessings of the Master. I still have my doubts and fears. Whom else can I appeal to for guidance? Success, victory, wealth, fortune – these are transient. The blessing that I seek from my Lord is totally different. I long only to serve at His feet, to be released from the world and granted true knowledge. He should show compassion and bless me with these. I may be undeserving, but He is generous.”</p>
		<p>This is the same blessing that Narada in the Chandogya Upanishad begs from his master Sanatkumara. This is life’s highest aspiration.</p>
		<p>Seshadri Iyer wanted to be a sanyasi, I was told. I vaguely remember hearing that he received holy orders as a sanyasi on his deathbed, but I am not sure. During his final illness, V.N. Iyer tried to comfort him by saying that he seemed to be getting better.</p>
		<p>“Nonsense! What getting better?” Seshadri Iyer retorted. “Don’t you see that the time predicted in my horoscope is at hand?”</p>
		<p>V.N. Iyer bowed his head in sad assent.</p>
		<p>I also know that he wanted to clear his conscience by rectifying an injustice. When Sehadri Iyer was Diwan, Yelandur Jagirdar P.N. Krishna Murthy had the strongest claim to succeed him. But it was an open secret that Seshadri Iyer wanted to promote one of his own favorites brought from Madras by pushing Krishna Murthy aside. Finally, the Resident’s office provided the Diwan with evidence that some of his trusted courtiers were scheming behind his back to undermine him. Knowledge of this, or more likely his own sense of justice, made him change his mind and recommend Krishna Murthy as Diwan. On the day before his death, he invited Krishna Murthy to his bedside and informed him that he had been recommended to succeed him as Diwan. Seshadri Iyer told him, “I have no personal animosity towards you. May God give you health and happiness so you may serve your king and your country. May you emulate your great ancestors and achieve fame by serving your people. Before I go, I just want you to know that I have no ill will towards you.”</p>
		<p>Krishna Murthy, a gentle, simple-hearted person was moved to tears by this appeal.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-04">4 </a></sup></p>
		<p>The SDO Sahib – V.N. Iyer – was interested in Vedantic philosophy, but it was an interest marred by narrowness. He was of the view that there was a good deal in common between Vedanta, as he understood it and modern science – meaning ‘modern’ for those days (c. 1905). He was always ready and willing to be the teacher of this viewpoint to anyone willing to be taught. Someone who knows both science and Vedanta thoroughly may find similarities between the two – I am in no position to say. One who is ignorant of both will have no difficulty in connecting the two – especially when armed with authority. The SDO’s subordinates listened to his discourses on the subject with utmost attention and respect. As I had studied science I used to keep my mouth shut. Or I would find some official reason to excuse myself.</p>
		<p>SDO V.N. Iyer was a follower of the Advaita or Non-dual school of philosophy. They are called Smarthas. As a Madhva Brahmin I am a follower of the Dvaita school expounded by Acharya Madhva (1238 - 1317) in the thirteenth century. In some ways it stands in opposition to Advaita. V.N. Iyer regarded Madhvas like me as fallen Smarthas.</p>
		<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-05">5</a></sup>
		<p>According to him Srivaishnavas are not Brahmins at all. They are totally beyond the pale and beyond redemption.</p>
		<p>Taking pity on my fallen state which he believed would exclude me from heaven, he tried to guide me along the true path. But I was not too concerned about salvation or heaven. Nor did I have much interest in the hair-splitting differences between dual and non-dual philosophies.</p>
		<p>All I knew was that I was a Madhva by birth, as were my ancestors and saw no reason to change. Several times I dropped hints that I was not interested in being shown the true path. It didn’t work. Finally, I told him the following story.</p>
		<p>My father’s elder brother Vyasacharya (1819 -1904) was a renowned scholar. He had gained fame at various centers of learning like Tirupati through his expositions of the various schools of philosophy. He was extremely fond of me. When I was a small boy, he once asked me, “What are you learning at school, Ramu?”</p>
		<p class="myquote">“English,” I proudly replied.<br />According to my uncle, our conversation went on like this.<br />“What is English for God?”<br />“God”<br />“Father?” “Papa.”<br />“Uncle?” “Don’t know.”<br />“Clever?” “Don’t know.”<br />“Fool?”</p>
		<p>“I know the word for fool,” he recalled me as saying. “They say Vyasa Kaka (Uncle).”</p>
		<p>Although I had forgotten this exchange long ago, my uncle used to remember it with great amusement almost every time I went to see him. When I was older, he made me read and explain the Bible to him, since he did not know English. He then exclaimed: “What a great man Jesus was! His Sermon on the Mount – how it resembles what Lord Krishna told Arjuna.”</p>
		<p>Many years later, after I had completed my law studies, I went to see him at his home in Devanahalli.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-06">6 </a></sup>My uncle was with his students, in the midst of a teaching session. As soon as he saw me, he came and embraced me and went back to his teaching. I was full of pride with my recent achievement, and waited impatiently until he finished his teaching session and came back to me. Then I asked him, “Vyasa Uncle, you must have studied various schools of philosophy – the Dvaita, the Advaita and the Vishistadvaita.”</p>
		<p>“I have,” my uncle replied, “to the best of my ability.”</p>
		<p>“How about Christian and Muslim scriptures – have you studied them too?”</p>
		<p>“You translated and explained part of the Bible for me some years back. Recently, I have had a chance to look through the Kannada Bible published in Mangalore. I have not studied the Muslim Holy Book.”</p>
		<p>“Having studied all these, which one do you think is really true?” I asked him, hoping to trap and defeat him, or at least impress him with my lawyer’s cleverness. (May God forgive me!)</p>
		<p>He was quiet for a while. He then gave me a long look – a look as guileless as a child’s – and said, “Which one is true you ask? How can I know? Only the Lord Srihari knows the truth. I can only tell you what I believe in. What I believe in is what I learnt from my revered father and teacher – the teachings of our supreme Vaishnava sage – Sri Madhvacharya. It has given me both peace and happiness. I ask for nothing more.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-07">7 </a></sup></p>
		<p>I felt very humble. I expressed my profound respect by prostrating before him. He comforted me with affection and humour.</p>
		<p>“That is my belief,” I told the SDO V.N. Iyer, who was trying to show me the true path. Indeed it expresses my belief. The God that I believe in is full of compassion and forgiveness. I can appeal to him as a son to a father, and as a friend to another. I find it impossible to accept that such a God would be so vindictive as to make weak and fallible humans fall into eternal hell.</p>
		<p>V.N. Iyer had great faith in astrology. I have already related his story about Seshadri Iyer and his horoscope. He would never start anything without checking for auspicious time and signs. I found it highly amusing. “Why should planets be so interested in what you and I do?” I once asked him in jest.</p>
		<img src="images/0047.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>“Rain drenches you and the sun can burn you,” he retorted. “Can you say that Indra (the Rain God) and the Sun are ill-disposed towards you because you are such a big man?”</p>
		<p>I didn’t know how to respond and let it go at that.</p>
		<p>Do I believe in astrology? What can I say? As to the question whether it is a science that allows one to predict future events on the basis of the calculation of planetary positions – I have not studied it sufficiently to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. My own view is that there is not enough evidence to call it a science. At the same time I would not want to dismiss it as nothing but nonsense perpetrated by frauds. From the beginning of history, many men and women of great learning, experience, and wisdom in all countries have believed in astrology. Many still do. I am not prepared to say they are all fools and only I have the good sense to disbelieve it. But every one of us has the right, even the duty, to examine the evidence and arrive at conclusions based on one’s own experience and judgment. So I can only relate what I have learnt from my experience without passing judgment on the rest of humanity.</p>
		<p>In my experience, I have known predictions made by astrologers to go wrong – not merely wrong, but ludicrously wrong. But I have also known a few instances when they have been astonishingly accurate. I will next relate one of them from my own experience.</p>
		<p>It is best to begin the story when I was assistant secretary while Sir</p>
		<p>M. Vishweshwaraya was Diwan.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-08">8 </a></sup>I was then attached to a department known as the Economic Conference, in charge of the agriculture section. It was an environment in which bureaucratic exercises like showmanship, report writing, and voluminous correspondence carried more weight than productive work. As I was spending my time engaged in this shadow boxing, I became interested in a truly worthwhile project – one that could enrich the state and also bring great benefits to the people. This was silk production – or sericulture. If properly cultivated, it had the potential for providing employment for lakhs of our people, and also bring to the state an annual revenue exceeding a crore of rupees.</p>
		<p>Sericulture in Mysore was then in a sorry state. If neglected, it was in danger of becoming extinct within a few years. Recognizing this, the Government had invited several foreign ‘experts’ to remedy the situation. It did not take me long to recognize that these experts knew nothing about the problem, and their ‘advice’ was making it only worse. I decided that nobody had bothered to properly study the problem. I undertook a tour of the various silk producing centers in the state and made a detailed evaluation of the situation. In particular, I examined the past history when it was a flourishing industry, and the changes that had brought about its decline. I also examined the reasons why people were giving up silk farming and production. After a few months I felt I understood the problem and also saw what needed to be done to bring it back to health.</p>
		<p>I prepared a detailed plan and submitted it to the Government through my superiors. Some of my colleagues laughed at it. “Here comes the know-all genius to cure the incurable,” said one. “This fellow must have learnt silk rearing in law school,” said another. “These days, everybody has to have a gimmick,” said one more, “silk making is Rama Rao’s.” I paid them back with compound interest. None of them had any authority to either help me or hurt me.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, my old friend Kantha Raje Urs was the chairman of the Economic Conference. I spent of a good deal of time explaining what I had done. He listened to me with an open mind and concluded there was merit in what I had recommended. He felt that I should be given the opportunity to put my plan into effect and recommended that an entirely new department be created for the purpose. He put the full weight of his authority behind my plan and got the Government to sanction the Department of Sericulture along the lines I had recommended. The Government approved it and I was invited to be its chief. (It helped that Kantha Raje Urs succeeded Vishveshwaraya as Diwan.)</p>
		<p>I accepted my new position with misgivings, with a sense of duty. I felt I could discharge the responsibility successfully, and it would result in excellent employment opportunities for lakhs of our people. It would bring prosperity to thousands of families, and a beautiful industry of the state that was on the verge of extinction would again flourish. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to make a real contribution. But it also meant some sacrifice on my part. It meant giving up any hopes of being promoted to posts like the deputy commissioner (DC) or secretary to the Government. To govern a district as DC had been a lifelong dream with me. It was not easy to give up all this. In any event, I reconciled myself to the possibility that I would serve out my tenure in the Government in this one department, receiving only the promotions and positions created for it.</p>
		<p>I served in Department of Sericulture for twelve years, devoting all my energy and intelligence to building up the silk industry in the state. I can say that I achieved the goals that I had set for the Department. I had no dreams beyond retiring as Director of Sericulture. As it turned out later, this was not to be the end of my career, but the beginning of a new one. I had not the faintest idea that I would serve in different positions or that I would travel abroad and participate in national and international events.</p>
		<p>This was the situation when my friend Venkat Krishnaiah of Sakleshpur and I went to Hassan on some work. Nanaswamy Rao was then DC of Hassan district. While we were engaged in conversation at his house, a young man – an engineering student I think he was – stopped by. Nanaswamy Rao introduced him to me and said, “You see, he is a very gifted astrologer. Show him your horoscope. I don’t know if it is God’s gift or what, but every single thing he says comes true.”</p>
		<p>Venkat Krishnaiah had complete faith in astrology. He has studied it and has now acquired some proficiency in the subject. I was then a total non-believer. It must have showed on my face. I told the visitor that I did not have my horoscope with me.</p>
		<p>“Doesn’t matter,” the young man said. “Let me take a look at your hand.”</p>
		<p>I held out my hand with a laugh, which might have sounded slightly mocking.</p>
		<p>He looked at my hand intently for a few minutes and said, “If you can relate a few incidents of importance from your life, I can tell you if your hand matches them.”</p>
		<p>This only made me more suspicious.</p>
		<p>“Why don’t you tell me what you find in my hand,” I replied with a laugh. “So I can tell you if they are correct.”</p>
		<p>He took up the challenge. He took me aside and told me several things about my life, which I thought no one else knew. He told me the year in which I joined the service, the exact number of my brothers and sisters and the number of children I had with perfect accuracy. I was totally taken aback. He then took my date and time of birth according to the English (Gregorian) calendar and cast my horoscope.</p>
		<p>“I’ll read the chart and send you a summary of my predictions tomorrow,” he told me. I received the following summary the next day.</p>
		<p>“You will go to the Secretariat. Your horoscope shows a sea voyage – visiting foreign countries. You will participate in a major political event. You will become the head of a Government Department in such and such a year, and retire in such and such year.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-024-09">9 </a></sup>After retirement, you will continue to make important contributions and be awarded a title by the Maharaja.”</p>
		<p>None of these seemed remotely possible at the time; they had not even crossed my mind. But every one of them came true. The young man I believe works now in the Public Works Department (in 1952). I cannot recall his name.</p>
		<p>Another incident comes to mind. My friend N.S. Subba Rao was a firm believer in astrology. In 1930, when our Diwan Sir Mirza Ismail was to lead a delegation to the First Round Table Conference in London, it was expected that he would be taking two staff members with him. It was known that one of them would be Nyamati Madhava Rao, then Chief Secretary (later Diwan). It was not known who the second member might be. I was then Development Secretary. A few days earlier, the Diwan asked me if I was willing to accompany him to England for the Conference (1930). I happily agreed. But then, Sir Brijendranath Seal, the famous Vice Chancellor of Mysore University, strongly recommended that N.S. Subba Rao should be the second member. Seal’s recommendation carried considerable weight and it looked as though my chances had dimmed somewhat. This was the situation when Subba Rao and I were having a friendly chat at the club one evening. He had already been to England on a previous occasion.</p>
		<p>“According to my horoscope,” Subba Rao said half in jest, “I am to make a second trip to England this year. Poor you – you have no chance.”</p>
		<p>His astrologer was one Srinivas Iyengar, if I remember right. He worked in the Revenue Commissioner’s office. I found his faith in astrology amusing.</p>
		<p>“My astrologer has also predicted that I’ll go to England this year,” I joked. “He is also a formidable character. It’s my astrologer against yours. Let us see who will come out on top.”</p>
		<p>The end result? Both of us went to England that year. What to make of it?</p>
		<p>All this is a digression – taking us from 1908 to 1930. But it is in the nature of a book of reminiscences to make such leaps in space and time.</p>
		<p>Before going on this digression on astrology, I was speaking of the SDO V.N. Iyer and his visit to my taluk for the jamabandi. He was somewhat clueless when it came to revenue matters, but he had that not so common quality known as commonsense. The jamabandi proceeded smoothly. His manner of speaking with the villagers and farmers struck me as a little rough, partly because of his Tamil accented Kannada. It also had a pungent edge that is common among people coming from the lowlands to the south. It is not easy to describe but an example might help.</p>
		<p>We went to visit a village known as Turuganoor. A downpour the previous night had caused the open drains to overflow and flood parts of the main street with sewage. Many village notables, including the Patel, had come to see the visiting SDO Sahib. The Sahib made some routine inquiries and then turned to the Patel.</p>
		<p>“Hello Patel!” the Sahib said, “have you kept your village clean.”</p>
		<p>“As much as possible my lord,” the Patel replied, “you must see for yourself.”</p>
		<p>As we were going through the village the Sahib could see and smell the overflowing sewage.</p>
		<p>“I say Patel,” the SDO asked, “do they call this clean in your language?”</p>
		<p>“What to do my lord? Learning of your visit, the Rain God blessed us with this rain after a long dry spell.”</p>
		<p>The Patel was not without wit, but the SDO was not to be outdone. He turned to me and said, “This is what I call real devotion. Please put it on record, Subedar Sahib that learning of my visit to his village, the Patel had arranged for a downpour of smelly, sewage-mixed, rain.”</p>
		<p>Within a year of my taking charge as Amildar of Narsipur, V.N. Iyer had to leave the service under something of a cloud. Following his retirement, there was some sort of a plot by a few officials to discredit him by floating charges. As soon as I learnt of it, I secretly investigated the charges. Finding most of them to be baseless, I did not allow the episode to go any further.</p>
