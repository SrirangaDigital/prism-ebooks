		<p><strong><em>Rama Rao’s skill as a violinist. Meeting the great musician Shamanna and the genesis of a famous story. Learning French and trying it on Frenchmen. </em></strong></p>
		<p>A major problem faced by any Amildar those days was filling leisure time. In his own small world, he was the lord of all he surveyed, which made him also a more or less public figure who was always exposed to the gaze of the subjects. His position was unique, because his authority was great and yet he was close to the people. Along with the weather and the news, the Amildar and his latest exploit was a common topic of conversation. It included such things as his friends, in particular those who commanded his favors and influence. There were often questions about the Amildar’s interest in music and the arts; whether it was limited to the arts or extended to the artists also. About me in particular it was said, “The Amildar is short-tempered, but kind-hearted. Though he doesn’t care about money, he likes flattery. One can have one’s way by flattering him. Is he attracted to women? Outwardly he may seem so, but not really.” One often heard such questions and gossip.</p>
		<p>This was my general experience. The best way to deal with it is to ignore it. It is not easy for a person in authority to find sincere friends. I have to say this with some reluctance; when such an official is friendly with someone, he may jump to the conclusion that favors can be obtained through his friendship. Or others may try to influence the official through the friend. But there are also happy exceptions. When I was working on my wrestling at a gym, I cannot recall anyone there trying to gain favors from me. When I was in Yedatore as Amildar, I was on friendly terms with an elderly Pathan by name Rahman Khan who for a while taught me fencing as practiced in his country. He never accepted a single pie in return. He also refused to oblige his fellow Muslims who tried to put pressure on him to gain favors from me. I learnt of it only much later, that too from others.</p>
		<p>The same was true of our boatmen with whom I was on friendly terms. They were often in trouble with the law – mostly for petty offences like small theft and fighting – most of the time because of their insatiable thirst for drink. This would bring them to my court. They never once complained or tried to bring up the issue of their friendship or former services.</p>
		<p>“I did a stupid thing my lord!” was their usual defense. “I am a poor man; please don’t fine me. Just give me a short sentence. I’ll serve it.”</p>
		<p>Whenever I had to sentence them, they accepted it philosophically, without a trace of anger.</p>
		<p>“What can you do, my lord? I have to reap what I sow.”</p>
		<p>I recall an occasion when a boatman serving a sentence had done excellent work growing a small garden in the prison yard. I complimented him on his work. The police guard told me that he was to be released the next day.</p>
		<p>“Aren’t you Ajjun Nayaka?” I asked him. “If you can do such excellent work outside the prison also there is no need for you to spend time inside it. You are being released tomorrow. From now on, at least, try to be sensible.”</p>
		<p>A week or so later, the police brought him again for some violation or other. I was angry, but also sad.</p>
		<p>“You jackass! You were released only last week. Didn’t you know better than getting into trouble again? Are you a man or an animal?”</p>
		<p>“No, my lord!” he replied without a trace of bitterness. “I still need to finish the garden I started. The rose cuttings have to be replanted and watered properly. I’ll finish it this time. I won’t come again – I promise.”</p>
		<p>He spoke true to his nature; not as a criminal. I was surprised and saddened by his attitude.</p>
		<p>Leisure is not easy to mange for a sociable person, especially one used to civilized activity. It is human nature to share one’s happy experiences with others. When this is not possible, one has to find other hobbies to fill one’s time. I used to spend some of my leisure time in riding and hunting. I had two horses and I used to ride at least fifteen or twenty miles a day, visiting villages in the taluk. This provided me with intimate knowledge of the people and their problems. But there was little scope for hunting in Narsipur taluk. I wasn’t keen on shooting birds and deer. Let alone forest, there weren’t even clumps large enough to hold tigers and leopards in the populous taluk. One could on occasion shoot a crocodile or two in the rivers. This brought some relief to cattle owners but there was little real sport involved.</p>
		<p>What saved me from boredom were two things – violin lessons from my venerable senior friend Shamanna and my strenuous efforts to learn French language and literature on my own.</p>
		<p>Shamanna is none other than the hero of the story ‘Subbanna’, written by my friend Masti.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-01">1</a></sup> He has put together the bits and pieces I gave him about the extraordinary life story of Shamanna and turned it into a literary masterpiece. It is no ordinary work, but one that brings to life the travails of a great artist trying to find peace in his art.</p>
		<p>Here is how I got to know Shamanna. On the occasion of the Sri Rama festival in Narsipur, I heard a young violinist by name Venkatasubbaiah who was the Shanbog of Alagod. I was stunned by his artistry. I may have heard two or three violinists with a tone as beautiful as his. I have known celebrated musicians with ten times his knowledge and skill. They would have given anything for a tone like his. But Venkatasubbaiah neither desired nor received any fame.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-02">2 </a></sup>Exceedingly shy, he was in his element only before a small audience of friends and acquaintances. His was a talent like a buried treasure or a fragrant flower in a deep forest. One does not expect to hear such divine music from a village clerk in Alagod.</p>

		<p>To describe his tone, I can compare him only to Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-028-03">3 </a></sup>When I first heard Dwaram, it reminded me of poor Venkatasubbaiah’s playing, especially the tone. When it comes to musical knowledge, Naidu is like an ocean; Venkatasubbaiah was but a puddle in comparison. But the beauty of sound and taste raised my poor friend to the same level as the great master. I say this with some knowledge of music, for I too have ‘scratched the violin’ for many years. My views on his playing are based on this knowledge experience, as well as the opinions of several knowledgeable friends and other musicians</p>
		<p>After his recital, I approached him, and spoke to him in a friendly fashion, complimenting him on his playing.</p>
		<p>“Your music was wonderful!” I told him. “Who taught you to play so divinely?”</p>
		<p>He pointed to an elderly, somewhat portly man with a dark complexion seated at the corner of the temple and said, “The blessings of that great man.”</p>
		<p>I had seen him a few times at the temple. He was a solitary man, seemingly in a world of his own, entirely absorbed in thought and reflection. As soon as the mangalarathi was over, the old man got up and left leaning on a cane.</p>
		<p>A few days later, I ran into Venkatasubbaiah again. “I must hear your master play,” I told him. “Can you bring him over to my place?”</p>
		<p>“He has not touched the violin in perhaps twenty years,” he told me. “He destroyed his violin and threw it away in the river. He never goes anywhere or sees anyone. He is like that. You must not misunderstand his behavior.”</p>
		<p>Destroy his violin? And reject music altogether? Was he like Diogenes who hated mankind? Or was he another Timon of Athens, embittered by the treachery of friends? As I got to know him later, I found he was like none of them; he was neither a misanthrope nor a victim of ingratitude. He was a passionate soul tested by such grief and misfortune as would have felled a lesser man, who had finally found peace by freeing himself from attachment and hatred.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-04">4 </a></sup>I have seen him in the company of children playing and laughing like one of them. Each day, he would go to five houses and collect alms, which he would often distribute to the poor and the sick and sleep without food.</p>
		<p>I invite everyone to read his life story as narrated by Masti in his wonderful story ‘Subbanna’. There is no point in my repeating it here. Nor does it make sense to compare my account with his. My goal here is only to describe Shamanna as I saw him and relate how we became intimate friends in spite of our very great difference in age.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-05">5 </a></sup>I used to run into him at temples, sometimes bathing in the temple ghat or on the street. At first he ignored me, avoiding my eyes as he walked past me. Then I took to saluting him with folded hands, which he would return in the same manner, with a dignified expression. On a few occasions, when I had recitals arranged at my place, I managed to get him to come with a special invitation sent through Venkatasubbaiah. A few times, when he was ill, I went to see him to ask if he needed any help from me. He would just laugh and say:</p>
		<p>“Lord Parthasarathy himself is driving my chariot. What more do I need?” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-06">6 </a></sup></p>
		<p>I visited his dwelling, if it could be called that – a narrow platform attached to the temple, a few ragged clothes, a mat on the bare floor, vessel for carrying alms, a clay lamp and a stick. Was he a character out of our epics, like Partha or Bhishma, I wondered? And how real and concrete his vision of God seemed to be!</p>
		<p>When the plague struck Narsipur, people had to leave their homes and live in camps outside the town. The families living in the five homes that he used to visit for food also had to leave town. As the plague swept across the taluk, it was a hectic time for me with a great deal of travel and other work. I had set up a camp for my family also in the yard of the traveler’s Bungalow. I had all members of the family inoculated and left to visit other places in the taluk. When I returned after more than a week, I ran into Venkatasubbaiah and asked him how Shamanna was doing. With tears in his eyes, he told me, “I begged him to come and stay with me until the epidemic passed, but he refused. Then I took him food for a few days. All of a sudden, one day, he disappeared without telling me. When I inquired around, I learnt that he had moved to a deserted shrine by the river in Madapur. I went to see him. When he saw me, he became furious and said, ‘Have you come here also to bind me? If I see you again I’ll leave this place.’ He is a very stubborn man. I went to the Patel of Madapur and begged him to take care of my teacher. Madapur is a Lingayat village, so they cannot feed him. They can only give him fruits and milk. I left some money with the Patel.”</p>
		<p>My wife’s heart melted at the story.</p>
		<p>“Should that poor old man die alone, with no one to care for him?” she asked. “Why doesn’t someone go and get him here.”</p>
		<p>“I can’t cry like young Venkatasubbaiah,” I said half in jest. “My method is to arrest those unwilling to come and bring them by force. I can’t use that here. So why don’t you go yourself and use your powers of gentle persuasion?”</p>
		<p>I intended it as joke, but my wife took it seriously. She insisted that I take her to Shamanna. I was planning to go anyway, but she insisted on going with me. We took the cart and went to Madapur, some five miles from our place.</p>
		<p>We found Shamanna seated in the open porch of a small shrine. He stood up as soon as he saw us, and spread the humble mat before us, offering it as a seat in a style indicative of a man who had known better days.</p>
		<p>“The lady and the gentleman should please sit down,” he said. “You have travelled far to see this poor man. What can I do for you?”</p>
		<p>“We’ll tell you if you’ll promise to say ‘yes’,” my wife told him.</p>
		<p>“What is this madam – like the Lord coming to Kuchela’s house for alms?” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-07">7 </a></sup></p>
		<p>“Grandfather! You are not Kuchela,” replied my wife. “And I don’t have to tell you that we are not Yadava rulers. You are certainly not a man struggling for food and clothes like Kuchela. And Kuchela was no musician like you. All I have to ask you is this. You must come home with us and teach music to my daughters Brahmani and Venku. I too play the veena. I am a bit rusty and I want to get back to playing. You must help me also. I’m not going to take no for an answer.”</p>
		<p>Shamanna gave her a hard look. First there was a frown of annoyance that gradually gave way to a smile, which he seemed to want to suppress. Then it burst out into a loud laugh. He kept smiling and finally and said, “So madam! Husband and wife have come to trap me and take me home. What I planned was one thing and God’s wish is another. All right! Let God’s wish be fulfilled. I’ll come, but on one condition. I’ll stay in your house only during the lessons and for meals. At other times I’ll not be under your roof. I’ll be at the nearby Mooleshwara Temple. You must understand that I am a barbarian who doesn’t mix with people. You must excuse my lack of sociability. Another condition: I may leave and go any time – without reason or notice. You should not object.”</p>
		<p>We agreed. He returned with us in the cart to Narsipur and stayed with us for two months. During this time he taught my wife and daughters music and also read and explained the Jaimini Bharata.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-08">8 </a></sup>He was with us for the duration of the plague epidemic and then returned to his usual life of solitude. But our music lessons continued and I too, joined his students to improve my violin-playing. He became quite cordial with us and would come over for meals whenever invited. He grew especially fond of my second daughter Venku Bai. A couple of years later I was promoted and moved to Bangalore. As our cart was leaving Narsipur, he came to see us and took leave of my daughter with tears in his eyes. The scene is beautifully described in Masti’s ‘Subbanna’.</p>
		<p>He unexpectedly paid us a visit in Bangalore, giving Venku some toys he had brought for her. He made her sing some devotional songs he had taught and returned after staying with us for two days. With great difficulty, I made him accept a gift of a pair of dhotis. But typically he insisted that he would exercise his right as their owner and gave them away to his pupil Venkatasubbaiah. Shamanna was one of the most unusual men I have known.</p>
		<p>Next a few words about my study of French. My younger brother Navaratna Krishna Swamy had spent many years at the French enclave of Pondicherry. He often spoke glowingly of the French language and its literature. During his visits he used to bring me some French books. With his help I read a couple of them. His enthusiasm proved infectious. I purchased an excellent French dictionary and several outstanding literary works and began an independent study of French literature. I began by devoting two hours to it every day.</p>
		<p>The work I chose was the famous novel ‘Les Miserable's by Victor Hugo. It is large in bulk and demanding in language and style. Initially, I found it a hard nut to crack. But I have teeth of iron and a will of steel. At first it was hard for me to finish even one page in the two hours I had devoted to French each day. Gradually, the language began to yield and I began to appreciate the work. Once in a while I would go to Srirangapttanam and get help from a French priest by name Father Lorenge who lived there. Along with ‘Les Miserable’s’ I read also some lighter works like stories and short poems. It took me six months to finish ‘Les Miserable’s’. Then I also read works by Guy de Maupassant, Voltaire, Balzac, and a few others. After I finished reading Hugo, my knowledge of French reached the point that I could read any book in the <span>language without difficulty. It opened the door to the literature of another cultured Western language. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-029-09">9 </a></sup></span></p>
		<p>But the language one acquires from reading books is limited: not a dead language perhaps, but a sleeping one. For it to come to life, one must hear it spoken by native speakers of the language. And then, one should speak the language well enough for others to follow it without difficulty. Even though I can claim to read ‘book French’ fairly well, I found it quite useless when I went to France. When I spoke what I thought was French, people found it impossible to follow me. When they spoke French, they ran their vowels and consonants together in a manner reminiscent of the way native Tamilians speak Tamil. It frequently left me baffled. By the time I could grasp the first word, the sentence would be over. After I had spent some time in France, I was filled with admiration for their mastery of spoken French. “Splendid,” I thought, “These people really know how to speak their mother tongue.”</p>
		<p>Even though my mastery of the violin and of French may be said to be on the same level, they have both provided me with many hours of enjoyment and also the means of filling my leisure time.</p>
