		<p><strong><em>Vani Vilas, the mother of the Maharaja, plans to visit Narsipur. Disappointment followed by triumph. A folk drama takes an unusual turn. Diwan Madhwa Rao tries once more and fails. </em></strong></p>
		<p>As we were excavating the temples Kantha Raje Urs had told me that he would try to get some member of the royal family to visit them, especially those of Mudukutore and Talkad. Thanks to his efforts, his elder sister (and the Maharaja’s mother) Maharani Vani Vilas<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-01">1 </a></sup>decided to visit the area. I received her itinerary along with instructions to make arrangements for her visit. The deputy commissioner (DC), Kantha Raje Urs, promised me full support and all the facilities necessary for the arrangements. He wrote me personally informing me that he had spoken highly of me to his sister and that if I were to create a good impression on her during her visit, it would be reflected in the Maharaja’s attitude towards me. He pointed out that it was an excellent opportunity for me to improve my standing in the Government at the highest level.</p>
		<p>Of course, I knew all that. But such an opportunity is a double-edged knife that can cut both ways. To begin with, I had no experience entertaining royal visitors or making arrangements to suit their high taste. I knew Kantha Raje Urs well, but I saw him more as a friend and senior colleague than as royalty. Not every prince and princess is as understanding and easygoing as he was. I had also heard that the Queen Mother was a somewhat willful person, used to having things her own way. I have already related the problems a previous Amildar had – when I was still probationer – when the Maharaja visited Megalapur.</p>
		<p>I saw the DC and expressed my pleasure at the opportunity and gratitude for the honor. I then consulted a few Amildars and other officials who had experience hosting royal visitors and asked for their suggestions. They told me it was a difficult task. The first task was to make sure that there was money available to provide enough supplies to everyone at low cost. Royal visitors, their courtiers in particular, tend to be long on demands and short on payment.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-02">2</a></sup> One should always be available and do everything possible to keep the palace staff in good humor. The person who told me this left me to imagine what all this involved.</p>
		<p>“After the visit is over,” one told me, “and after the torrent of anonymous complaints has ceased, thank your favorite God for leaving your honor intact and enjoy peaceful sleep for a week.”</p>
		<p>“It is a thankless task,” said another. “It is a profitable venture for little fellows, while all blame falls on the Amildar,” said a third.</p>
		<p>There was nothing to do but shoulder the responsibility. I saw Kantha Raje Urs and gave a detailed report of my plans for the visit and requested him to come and inspect the arrangements personally. The arrangements briefly involved the following: painting the trees along the highway with stripes of red mud and lime; setting up a well-decorated reception porch at the taluk boundary with royal signs as well as banners expressing loyalty and devotion. We also needed young men and women to greet the royal party with cheers and songs. Most important of all, we had to set up a temporary facility to house the royal visitors and their entourage.</p>
		<p>The last was a formidable task. Mudukutore was in those days a settlement with a dozen or so houses with tile roofs. In the surrounding groves there were a few Veerashaiva Mutts, mostly stone structures. There were also some open buildings; relatively primitive facilities for visiting devotees. It was nothing but a temple village with some dilapidated buildings that served to house an occasional visitor or two who didn’t mind the primitive conditions. At the time of the jatra, the whole place would acquire a life of enchantment with thousands of temporary shelters, and then return to being the sleepy village which it was. This place was now asked to host the royal party!</p>
		<p>In those days it had a small Inspection Bungalow for visiting government officials. As I recall now it was a tile-roofed building with a living area twelve feet by ten feet, and a front porch (or verandah) extending for about six feet in front. For four nights, this humble place had to house the visitors who had grown up in royal comfort. The job was made particularly difficult by the fact that the Queen Mother would be leading a party of royal ladies. They could hardly live like ordinary women. Her party included twelve members of the royal family, her chamberlain known as the Baxi (or the Durbar Baxi) and a staff of about fifty. Nominally their expenses would be paid to the taluk by the palace according to local rates. In reality, what was paid would not cover even a tenth of the total expenses. I would need facilities way beyond what was possible in a backwater temple town like Mudukutore. I would have to put together teams to attend to each and every detail.</p>
		<p>To give an example: the camp would require a daily supply of fifty seers of fresh milk. Remember, there were no refrigerators in those days. It was hard enough to get even one seer of extra milk in Mudukutore. The Queen Mother’s visit meant also the visit of the DC and his staff along with other invited and uninvited guests. All these had to be taken care of. The first task was to erect a temporary enclosure wall around the Inspection Bungalow using bamboo and cane. It was decided also to enlarge the Inspection Bungalow. The DC told me to go ahead and finish the job; that he would get the expenses sanctioned later. I felt it was best to be frank with Kantha Raje Urs.</p>
		<p>“It is of course on honor for me to host the Queen Mother,” I told the DC. “It is an opportunity for me to prove myself. But it is also a test of my ability and character. I am confident that I can discharge this responsibility to her satisfaction. But I need your full support. The work needs a lot of money. There is no point in hiding the truth. What my office can bill the palace covers only a fraction of the total cost. The real cost will be twenty or thirty times that. I have a good idea of the costs based on the experience of those who have hosted such affairs. This is not merely an official visit, but a festive occasion for everyone in the taluk. So, we must solicit and get the help of private parties to meet the needs of the occasion.”</p>
		<p>I then gave Kantha Raje Urs a detailed account of what all was involved.</p>
		<p>“What do you suggest we do then?” he asked.</p>
		<p>“First we must set up a reception committee to take care of the program and arrangement for receiving the royal party,” I replied. “This should be strictly a private affair run by the leading citizens of the taluk with no government involvement. I will arrange it so the Committee itself will raise the funds necessary for the program and reception. I will make sure that no government employee touches this money. I will provide staff support for book-keeping and administration so they are all in order. For erecting porches and other temporary structures we will need both materials and labor. I’ll put competent people in charge of each and make sure that everything is done under my personal supervision. We have a lot of work but we don’t have much time.”</p>
		<p>“It is fine with me,” said Kantha Raje Urs. “What support do you need from me?”</p>
		<p>“I should have your complete trust as regards my ability, judgment, and honesty,” I replied. “You must ignore any anonymous petitions that you may receive. After all, the people working on this will not be without enemies. We cannot accommodate everyone who wants to be involved. There is bound to be some envy at someone like me getting this honor."</p>
		<p>“I understand. You may work without fear.”</p>
		<p>“You should also visit us once in a while,” I told him, “encourage workers and help us with suggestions.”</p>
		<p>“Certainly Mr. Rama Rao,” he replied. “After all, it is my responsibility also.”</p>
		<p>This relieved me of most of my concerns. I set up a reception committee made up of leaders from each caste, community, and profession from all over the taluk. I set up branches of the committee in the larger towns like Bannur, Sosale, and Moogur and a central committee to co-ordinate the branches. I appointed one Krishna Rao as president and gave him staff consisting of a secretary, a treasurer, and a writer-clerk. They were housed in an office created for them. They were to report directly to me.</p>
		<p>In those days, the people’s affection and devotion for their rulers was real. So we had no difficulty raising the necessary funds and materials. Beginning with the Labbeys of Gargeshwari and the Dayireys of Bannur, people came forward with generous contributions. We collected thousands of rupees through their subscriptions.</p>
		<p>We brought Muslim craftsmen from Mysore for erecting and decorating shelters and Medas from Moogur and Nanjangud to prepare mats and roofs of bamboo and cane and other skilled workers to prepare temporary shelters for the camp. I made arrangements for fruits and vegetables to be supplied from Bangalore. I also made arrangements for musicians to entertain the Queen Mother and her party. We invited Venkataramayya of Rudrapatna, a famous veena player, to be present at the camp. It was his misfortune that he was a contemporary of Veena Sheshanna (1852 – 1926). Had he been born in a different era, he might have gained greater recognition than he did. Musically speaking, there was little to choose between him Sheshanna.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-03">3 </a></sup></p>
		<p>The greatest difficulty we had was getting enough milk. I had to virtually set up a dairy farm in Mudukutore importing some one hundred and fifty cows and buffaloes from neighboring villages. A temporary facility for them and the staff to take care of them had to be built in a grove adjoining the village. Keeping them supplied with fodder was a major headache. It is a peculiarity of cows that some of them give less milk when moved to an unfamiliar place. They can be as temperamental as humans.</p>
		<img src="images/0049.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Kantha Raje Urs came and inspected our arrangements a week before the scheduled royal visit and expressed full satisfaction and complimented me for my thoroughness. Two days before the visit, the advance guard of the party came to inspect our arrangements. They were known as avasarada sibbandi as I recall. It was led by a small group of self-important men in sartorial splendor. Two of them were Brahmins, who were known to Krishna Rao, president of the reception committee. I knew they would be trouble, so I asked Krishna Rao to use his influence with them to make the inspection go smoothly. It was futile. They were bent on showing off their importance. They proved a bloody nuisance.</p>
		<p>We did our best, entertaining them with lavish food and a music recital. It was a waste of money. They went around trying to frighten my staff that there would be no visit unless they gave a favorable report on the arrangements. They made a practice of looking for minute errors and harassing my staff. I suspected they were expecting bribes. I finally managed to bring them around. It happened as follows.</p>
		<p>One of them complained that the milk was bad and that it went sour immediately after being boiled. I called the milkman and the inspector in charge and gave them a dressing down and asked them to inspect the arrangements thoroughly. Finding nothing wrong, I supplied a fresh batch of milk. The milk inspector came back a few minutes later and told me in secret that I would find out the cause of the problem if I went to the camp immediately. This was only a few yards from where I was. When I went there, I saw one of the palace officials, the one who complained about the milk, dipping his hand into the large vessel in which the new supply of milk had been kept. The inspector caught him red-handed with lemon on his hands and shouted to me, “Look here, sir, this man is ruining the milk by dipping his lemon-soaked hand in it.”</p>
		<p>Other workers also joined him. As we had firm evidence, his hand still smelling of lime, he could not escape. I gave him a severe warning.</p>
		<p>“I am the local magistrate here,” I told him sternly. “And I have the authority to try you for this.”</p>
		<p>Then I called the Shirastedar and gave him a warrant to search his place. He found a stock of lemons and a bowl filled with juice at his lodgings. So I had enough evidence to try him. He was brought before me by the inspector and the supply officer. By then his whole attitude had changed. He fell at my feet and begged me not to report him to his superior officers. His companions were also greatly subdued. I decided against charging him. There was no need to antagonize them at this point. I felt it was better for me to keep it in reserve, as a potential weapon for future use, should the need arise. In general, I found these palace officials to be full of bluff. Their real importance never measured up to their self-importance.</p>
		<p>In any event, I completed all the arrangements to my satisfaction. I rode the whole route, covering every detail of the royal visit in the form of a dress rehearsal. It involved covering a distance of sixty-five miles on horseback. My two horses proved unequal to the task, so I had to borrow two more from others. Everything was to my satisfaction. When I returned to camp, I found a courier waiting for me with an urgent letter from Kantha Raje Urs. I eagerly opened and read it, “Due to an unexpected auspicious event, Her Highness Queen Mother has had to postpone her visit. Her eldest daughter, the princess, gave birth to a daughter this morning. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-04">4 </a></sup>Her Highness regrets the inconvenience caused and that so much effort put into the preparations should have gone to waste. Your extraordinary effort has been reported to her.”</p>
		<p>Her eldest daughter was none other than Kantha Raje Urs’ wife.</p>
		<p>I will leave it to the reader to imagine the depth of my disappointment; I cannot describe it in words. For a moment, everything seemed to go blank before my eyes. The same news had been sent to the palace workers also, ordering them to return immediately. I had no choice but to control my disappointment and convey the news to those who had come to work as volunteers and console them. I also sent a letter congratulating Kantha Raje Urs with the same courier who had brought me the bad news. In the same letter I wrote:</p>
		<p>“Please convey the following request to Her Highness, the Queen Mother. Even though her visit to Mudukutore had to be cancelled because of unforeseen circumstances, she should favor us with a visit as soon as possible.”</p>
		<p>Fortunately my request was honored before the preparations could be wound up; I received another letter informing me that her visit was only postponed by fifteen days. I received also the new schedule. This meant that I had to revive all the committees and organizational activities that were in the process of being disbanded. This was like reviving not a dead horse, but one that was dead tired. What amazed me was the love and devotion of our people who came back to their old tasks, still full of enthusiasm. We ran short of money, so I had to take personal charge of the matter. Kantha Raje Urs fully appreciated our position and made repeated trips to help us out. I cannot forget a particularly interesting trip to Kollegal, which turned out happily for me.</p>
		<p>He and I rode out to Kollegal. Sirdar Kantha Raje Urs was an excellent horseman. He had a whole stable of horses of all kinds. He was particularly fond of cross-country riding. As I am also fond of riding, he often used to take me along. My horse could not, of course, compare with his royal mount, especially when riding cross-country. At 175 pounds (80 kg) I was also a good deal heavier than he was. This combination of a heavier rider and a smaller horse made it difficult for me to keep pace with him. Still I kept pressing my horse to stay with the Sirdar and his mount. But this can go on only so long. My horse got tired and finally stumbled, with both the horse and the rider falling to the ground. Fortunately the ground was soft, and neither my horse nor I suffered any serious injury. But the Sirdar was distraught. He kept repeating, “How terrible! How terrible! One could get killed in an accident like this.”</p>
		<p>“My life is stubborn,” I replied, trying to make light of the accident. “Also, it is written that I should serve Her Highness on her visit.”</p>

			</figure>	
		<p>Soon after returning to Mysore, within two days, Kantha Raje Urs sent me a magnificent sixteen-hand horse suitable for cross-country riding. His name was Galway. I had never ridden such a wonderful horse fit for a prince. I assumed that it had been sent to me for the duration of the work associated with the Queen Mother’s visit. But thanks to the Sirdar’s generosity it became mine. It happened as follows. During Her Highness’ visit I escorted her wherever she went, mounted on Galway. After she returned to Mysore, Kantha Raje Urs informed me that the horse was mine to keep, telling me only to take good care of it and enjoy riding him. As I was about to protest, he silenced me by saying that it was the Queen Mother’s wish that I should keep him. I accepted it as a royal command.</p>
		<p>The Queen Mother’s visit proceeded as planned and went without a hitch. She was a pleasant, easy-going person like her brother (Kantha Raje Urs) who did not demand much.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-05">5 </a></sup>She appreciated the devotion and affection shown in any task and always expressed her happiness openly. She was particularly kind to me and once requested that food from my camp be brought to her. This was too much for her chamberlain known as the Durbar Baxi. These court officials tend to suffer from an excess of self-importance mixed with insecurity. (Most of them do nothing important and can easily be dispensed with, which they know.) He told me that the favor of requesting food from my camp, which Her Highness bestowed on me, was only because of the good word that he had put in on my behalf. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-06">6 </a></sup>As he was telling me this, a maidservant from her quarters – they were known as ‘Avveys’ – came looking for the Durbar Baxi. As soon as she saw him with me she came to us and said, “Sir there was some sand in the taat. The dishes were not washed properly. Her Highness wants to know if the Baxi has no sense.”</p>
		<p>The poor Baxi was flabbergasted.</p>
		<p>“O! What to do with these workers?” he lamented. “They don’t even do simple chores properly. They ruin my reputation. Everything falls on my head. Enough! Who wants this job?”</p>
		<p>Then he appealed to the maidservant, now practically on his knees, “Good lady! I beg you. Before Her Highness moves, would you please inspect things yourself and clean plates before serving? Please beg her on my behalf and tell her this won’t happen again. I’ll supervise the cleaning myself. Please ask her to forgive me this time.”</p>
		<p>This gave me an idea of his standing with the royal family. From then on I dealt with his tall claims accordingly. Recognizing that Her Highness had a good opinion of me, the palace staff left me mostly alone. These men seemed unable to see the difference between my duty and theirs – that my primary job was to run the taluk and not keep royalty happy. The Maharani, having ruled as regent from 1894-1902, during her son’s minority, clearly understood this.</p>
		<p>Her Highness later invited my wife and me to her quarters and spoke to us, inquiring about our children and us most graciously, while staying behind a cloth partition.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-06">7 </a></sup>She then asked my wife to bring a dozen or so</p>
		<p>‘Muttaideys’ (married women) from good families for the Gowri Puja to be hosted by Her Highness. My wife invited several ladies from nearby places like Talkad, Narsipur, Hemmige, and other places and took them to the Maharani’s quarters. The royal party included her granddaughters and five or six other princesses. There was a women’s durbar, in which some of the ladies sang and performed on instruments. My wife told me that Her Highness spoke freely with the invited ladies.</p>
		<p>A particularly attractive quality of the Queen Mother was her concern for the feelings of the less fortunate. This came to the fore during her women’s durbar. One of the women at the durbar was a large, dark, peasant woman of little sophistication who had brought her nursing child with her. As the baby began to cry, this simple woman began to breastfeed the child oblivious to the presence of others. This brought giggles and whispers from some of the more sophisticated ladies in the assembly – especially a few of the girls from Mysore. The Queen Mother would have none of it. She went over to the woman and said, “How fortunate you are, to be nursing a child like Yashoda nursing our Lord Krishna! Will you please bless our girls that they too may one day enjoy similar good fortune?”</p>
		<p>For the rest of the occasion, she remained close to that woman and honored her with presents for the child. Her personality reminded me of Lord Tennyson’s description of Queen Victoria:</p>
		<p>A thousand claims to reverence closed</p>
		<p>In her as mother, wife and queen</p>
		<p>The Maharani had the great veena player Venktaramayya of Rudrapattana play for her, and honored him suitably with gifts and money. She also visited the five temples making up the pancha-linga following the rules set for all the devotees. I always accompanied her to meet any needs. I had had a large boat with decorations and shelter built specially for her use. She used it for the teppotsava at the Mallikarjuna Temple and also for her own recreation on a moonlit night, which she greatly enjoyed.</p>
		<p><span>I will relate another incident which brought to the fore the Maharani’s concern for the feelings of the less fortunate.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-08">8 </a></sup>When we visited the Kirtinarayana Temple and the Shiva temples of Talkad and </span>Vijayapur, the Brahmin priests, who were trained in Sanskrit, were able to properly recite the Royal Prayer Rajarshirvada. At the Muduktore Mallikarjuna Temple, the priesthood is the hereditary right of barely literate rustic priests known as tammadi. They had some difficulty mastering the Sanskrit diction of the Royal Prayer. But they were keen to perform the service and present the offerings to the Maharani. It was their hereditary right, and they could also expect a generous gift of clothes and cash of hundreds of rupees from their ruler. They had even memorized the Royal Prayer for the occasion. I wanted to make sure that they could recite it satisfactorily. They showed they could manage it except for minor flaws in pronouncing aspirates and a few composite sounds. It was clear that they had gone to great trouble to learn it. I felt that they should not be deprived the opportunity of presenting honors to their Maharani, which obviously meant a great deal to them.</p>
		<p>The proceedings went smoothly, but when the moment for the Royal Prayer arrived, it was a minor disaster. Whether it was the excitement of the occasion or a memory lapse, the prayer learnt with such difficulty refused to come out. The poor fellow remained struggling but tongue-tied for more than a minute. He just froze. To make things worse, the Durbar Baxi became impatient and said, “It is getting late, let us proceed.” Finally, the poor fellow took courage in his hands and said simply in an atrocious accent, “Mantoni ginnantu tatastu.” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-09">9 </a></sup></p>
		<p>Everyone present was thunderstruck. Their faces fell at the outrage. Only Her Highness kept her cool and said with a smile, “Why don’t you please tell us in the Kannada we all know – ‘All the elders bless that God Mallikarjuna and Goddess Bhramaramba may bring peace and prosperity to the Maharaja and his kingdom.’ ”</p>
		<p>With this she thanked him profusely for the service and rewarded him with gifts and cash.</p>

		<p>“Her Highness wants to see a Bailunataka,” said the Durbar Baxi to me. “Could you arrange a performance?” <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-10">10</a></sup></p>
		<p>I told him I would check and let him know by the evening. Patel Puttey Gowda of Talkad was a well-known drama producer in the area. At one time he had put on the play ‘Nala Charitra’ for my family in the open area in front</p>
		<p>of the Traveler’s Bungalow. As women and children, including my own family, were in the audience, I had instructed him to tone down the racy parts. The place was filled with people who enjoyed the performance hugely. Their only complaint was that the Subedar had diluted the comedy parts.</p>
		<p>These performances, usually held in the open, mix music, folk dance and spoken dialogue. Their singing resembles the singing of Yakshagana, and is quite melodious.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-11">11</a></sup> The songs are based on familiar ragas, and the singing is robust and straightforward. It takes some getting used to, but one soon finds that it has its own rustic beauty. Its tala (rhythm) is not precise by the standards of classical music, but one should not expect rhythmic precision in such music any more than in the singing of a bird, a mountain stream, or wind blowing though trees. The play that I saw was excellent. When Nala leaves, abandoning his sleeping wife Damayanti in the forest while taking away half her clothes, the whole audience was in tears. They were consoled only by the sight of a sturdy pair of shorts underneath the unhappy princess’s torn sari.</p>
		<p>Patel Puttey Gowda was prepared to put on a play, but I was worried that the rough and ready language and acting may have elements that could shock the refined sensibilities of the Mysore princesses. I finally decided to check with the (DC). I suggested that we might put on a regular play instead – one that may be less crude.</p>
		<p>“They themselves want to see the kind of plays performed in the villages,” he told me. “They’ll have seen regular plays many times at places like Mysore and Bangalore. This is a rarity for them. So just arrange what they have asked.”</p>
		<p>“But if there is some offensive language or something, they may hold me responsible,” I replied, expressing my real concern. “They may think that this Amildar had no sense to expose these delicate ladies to such offense. Or they may feel that I did it deliberately – to shock them. I wonder if they could be displeased with me.”</p>
		<p>“That is always possible,” he agreed. “So you have to be a little careful.” That was hardly helpful. So I was on my own resources.</p>
		<p>For the performance, Puttey Gowda suggested Draupadi Vastrapaharana (‘Disrobing of Draupadi’) from the Mahabharata. “We just put it on,” he said. “The players know the parts well.”</p>
		<p>This made me tremble. Draupadi Vastrapaharana is the well-known story of the disrobing of Draupadi by the wicked prince Dusshasana in the Hastinapur assembly. Dusshasana of Hastinapur was of course defeated in his effort to humiliate her in public – thanks to the grace of Lord Krishna who made her garment infinite. But Dusshasana of Talkad, with no divine intervention, may prove victorious and succeed in stripping her and succeed also in outraging the modesty of our royal guests.</p>
		<p>“Let us leave Draupadi’s disrobing alone,” I told him hastily. The situation was fraught with danger.</p>
		<p>Finally we settled on Ramayana. I felt it offered no room for any outrageous mishaps. I told them to present it for the following evening. I wanted to see the actors. Puttey Gowda came with about a dozen men. There was a slight problem with the boy playing Sita Devi. (Women’s parts were played by men in those days.) This youngster was keen on growing a huge moustache, which was beginning to appear on his upper lip. He had set his mind on growing one, which of course he had to shave off if he was going to play Sita. This caused him great anguish. He suggested that he could always cover the moustache with his hand as part of his acting pose, but I turned it down. I pointed out to him that his moustache would grow again, but he may never get another chance to perform before royalty. Finally, after a great deal of soul-searching he agreed to sacrifice his budding moustache for the noble cause of serving the Maharani.</p>
		<p>Another problem had to be sorted out. A single actor has to play two or three different parts. This means that a fair amount of time is needed between acts for changing costume and settings. In village dramas, the usual practice is to fill this time with some form of comedy show. But the kind of comedy that our villagers appreciate is not the best fare for visiting princesses. We finally settled on a light farce.</p>
		<p>Its theme is as follows. A husband-and-wife team of thieves manages to escape from prison and go into hiding in fields and groves. Their idea is to somehow survive by petty theft when possible and by begging otherwise. But the hardness of a life on the run leads to endless arguments and fights between husband and wife. One night, they arrive dead tired at the home of a wealthy farmer and settle down to rest in the front porch of the house. Hearing some dogs barking, the lady of the house comes out to see them. Taking pity on them, she brings them some raw flour and buttermilk. The hungry couple feed themselves by mixing flour and buttermilk and drinking it. This soothes their anger and revives their spirit. The two, who were at each other’s throats, soon find each other attractive. As they begin their romantic activities, the police arrive and take the poor couple back to the prison.</p>
		<p>For reasons that I am unable to understand, villagers find this highly amusing. In village dramas, of course, they show the fight between the two and their later romantic reconciliation quite explicitly. When I first saw this short episode I felt that it reflected the dullness of family life, the ephemeral nature of happiness and unhappiness in life, and the general helplessness of poor people in society. I felt it was not unlike the moral tales found in the Upanishads.</p>
		<p>This farce was to be used to fill the interlude needed to change Dasharatha into Sugriva, Kausalya into Shurpanakha, and also change the sets so that Ayodhya could become Janasthana. I made it clear to the players that they should leave out all crude language and explicit scenes in their presentation. They were unhappy but agreed.</p>
		<p>The play began as scheduled at nine at night; it was to go on till midnight. A dozen or so ‘Washington lights’ lit the stage with white light to make it appear moonlit. The princesses and their companions sat in a makeshift royal box, shielded from public view by a cloth screen with windows, waiting eagerly for the performance to begin. I was with the VIPs, the DC and other dignitaries and invited guests, seated on chairs and benches in front of the royal box. Puttey Gowda and his company stood with humility and devotion, ready to present the program for the evening. I briefly introduced them and gave directions for the performance to begin.</p>
		<p>The play went on smoothly. It was a professional performance by seasoned actors. As it went through well-known episodes – Sita’s marriage to Rama, Kaikeyi’s anger and Rama’s exile – with the usual fanfare of drums, trumpets and dances, there were no signs of either approval or boredom from the occupants of the royal box. Having been up since cock’s crow, I was so tired that I was only waiting for the program to end so I could go and catch a good night’s sleep. In fact, I would have been happy if the royal party were to decide that they had seen enough and stopped the program early. Suddenly, things became lively.</p>
		<p>The scene shifted to Janasthana. Rama and Lakshmana are seated in the forest, speaking to Sita in Yakshagana music. All of a sudden, the light turns red, and there is a burst of drums, trumpets, horns and a host of other instruments accompanied by shrieks as the Rakshasa princess Shurpanakha jumps on the stage – screaming and gesturing wildly. She has come to frighten Sita and seduce Rama. I don’t know how Sita felt, but I almost had a heart attack. I can only attempt to describe her terrible form as presented by the master actor of Puttey Gowda’s company. Her ears were decorated with square baskets the size of two hands, her nose with a large twig from a neem tree, and on her back she had a large basket used for raising silkworms. The most dreadful of all were her breasts – two huge pillows specially made for the occasion.</p>
		<p>As she made her entry, the music director gave a few resounding thumps on his large drum – thai, thai, thakkada-dim, tadakina-tom – and set the measure for her terrible dance. She leaped five feet into the air, twirling right and left, brandishing her huge breasts up and down as if trying to seduce heaven and earth. It was a grotesque sight – sure to outrage the delicate sensibilities of the princesses in the royal box.</p>
		<p>This was beyond my wildest imagination. I felt that Kantha Raje Urs would be equally unhappy about the turn of events.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-12">12 </a></sup>I saw all the good work going down the drain because of this one mishap. I got up with the intention of going to the stage, asking them to stop the performance and apologize for the offense. I saw Kantha Raje Urs sitting with an uncharacteristically glum face; he avoided my eyes. We were saved by the second surprise of the evening. As I got up, I heard applause and peals of laughter from the royal box. The Durbar Baxi, who had been summoned into the royal box came out and said, “The dance is wonderful! Please let it go on for another five minutes.”</p>
		<p>The players needed no more encouragement. The performance went on till midnight. After the play, Her Highness, through the Durbar Baxi, sent Puttey Gowda a gift of offerings and cash. The princesses were apparently not as delicate as we had imagined!</p>
		<p>On our way back from the performance, Kantha Raje Urs asked me if I had planned the whole thing.</p>
		<p>“Is it possible, sir?” I replied. “The sight of that Shurpanakha struck me like a bolt of lightning.”</p>
		<p>“Luck always seems to be on your side,” he said as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
		<p>The Maharani had treated me throughout with utmost consideration. As she was about to return after completing her tour of the temples, Her Highness sent for me and said, “The last few days have been hectic. You must be very tired, doing so much to make our visit enjoyable. These four days were delightful. We don’t feel like going back. We are returning because our duty calls us back.”</p>
		<p>She offered me tambula;. I tried to say something appropriate but could think of nothing. Finally I just bowed to her with folded hands and said, “I am gratified that your visit here was pleasant. My devotion is great but my capacity is limited.”</p>
		<p>She and her party left. The DC patted me on the back and said that I had come through with flying colors – ‘in first class’, to use his own words. He too left in his car. By then I was so tired that I seemed to be in a trance. The compliments showered on me by palace officials sounded like dream music, passing from one ear through the other. The only sensation I had was a profound sense of relief that the whole thing was over. I just collapsed into a chair and had a smoke.</p>
		<p>A few days after the visit, I received notification from the Government transferring me to Pavagada as Amildar. Pavagada is a godforsaken taluk in a remote corner of the state. The DC Kantha Raje Urs was furious and demanded immediate revocation of the order. He said that there was a great deal that still remained to be done in the taluk, much of it half-done. He also wanted to know if the transfer was punishment for my excellent work in organizing the Maharani’s visit. He wrote a very strong letter objecting to the Government’s order. Kantha Raje Urs himself told me this. He said he would not release me from Narsipur without promotion.</p>
		<p>The order transferring me to Pavagada was cancelled. The Revenue Commissioner’s office (which reported to the Diwan) sent back a feeble excuse claiming that deteriorating conditions in Pavagada needed a highly capable officer. Drought and breakdown in law and order needed someone like me to restore normalcy, it claimed. As the Amildar with the best record in the state the Government wanted me to take charge. It was this need, and not any unhappiness over my performance that had brought forth the order, the letter claimed.</p>
		<p>“Then promote him,” Kantha Raje Urs retorted. He was already upset that I had been passed over for promotion in spite of his strong recommendation. This was too much.</p>
		<p>I read the whole thing differently. Because of my closeness to the palace, especially after my highly successful program during the Maharani’s visit, a high official who disliked me felt that I might use my influence to promote myself, or possibly even hurt him. I still believe that my interpretation was correct. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-13">13 </a></sup></p>
		<p>A few months after this, V.P. Madhava Rao’s term as Diwan ended and Sir T. Ananda Rao was appointed in his place. During the next few months I conducted an elaborate survey of lands that had changed their areas and shapes due to river action like deposition of alluvial soil and erosion. It was extremely demanding work that had been pending for several years. It involved a detailed re-examination of hundreds of survey numbers and reallocation of land and revenues. After I completed my work of regularizing survey numbers and revenue records, I was promoted and transferred to Bangalore as registrar. It was the end of my service as Amildar. It is also a convenient point to end my memoir. I’ll next devote a few pages to a ‘looking back’ at those years.</p>
		<p><strong>Appendix on the administrative effectiveness: Amildar as the pivot</strong></p>
		<p>I have often reflected on the days when I was Amildar – the authority and the respect that officials like me commanded and the pride with which I was able to discharge my official duties. The real love and respect that the people had for the Amildar in those days is not enjoyed by the Amildar today – or by any official for that matter. I am not saying this out of any personal vanity; nor am I suggesting that it was because of my personal qualities as an individual. I believe that there were many other Amildars like me who had gained the respect and affection of the people.</p>
		<p>This has set me thinking about the causes behind that state of affairs – when people had complete trust in the Government, which they identified with the Amildar. In those days, all the authority and the responsibility connected with the running of a taluk were concentrated in the hands of the Amildar. In previous years, during the days of chaos, the Amildar was essential for ensuring the wellbeing of the people as well as the authority of the rulers. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-14">14 </a></sup>In those days of poor communication, without the authority to enforce law and dispense justice in local hands, the result would have been anarchy.</p>
		<p>To the people, the Government meant the Amildar. The Amildar was the police chief; he had under his control, in addition to the police, thirty to forty staff members known as atavane kandachara.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-15">15 </a></sup>The Amildar was also the judge. So, swift and ready justice was available from the Amildar, like ‘water from the local river’. As a result, the Government to the people was something close and concrete, not remote and abstract. Justice obtained from a remote authority is like water brought from a deep well far away from home. The thirst resulting from the effort of drawing and bringing the water is enough to exhaust it. The Amildar in those days truly represented the Government for the people. He was always at hand to solve a problem or dispense justice.</p>
		<p>At the same time, the Amildar was also the representative of the people in the Government. Just as he was the Government for his taluk, he embodied the taluk as far as the Government was concerned. The state of communications being what it then was, higher officials were remote from most people; many did not even know who the Diwan or the Revenue Commissioner was.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-14">16 </a></sup>A good number had never seen even the deputy commissioner (DC). Since we did not have an elected government, we did not also have the influence, good or bad, of vote seekers. An Amildar of average competence would become familiar with his taluk within six months to a year. He would by then know the problems and strengths of each village in his taluk. So a conscientious Amildar would be in a position to fight for his people, representing their interests in the Government. He was the centre of gravity representing both the Government and the people with each other. In short, he was the pivot.</p>
		<p>This, I believe, was the secret behind the extraordinary effectiveness of the Mysore administration built around the Amildar.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-030-17">17 </a></sup>There is no need for me to detail the situation today. Government authority is more diffused and its centre of gravity has moved away from its local representative or the Amildar. And the Amildar also no longer represents the people. I do not know where the present situation will take us. When there is a total transformation of the Government, the lives of the people will not remain unaffected by it. Perhaps, the Amildar, who was the king’s representative, will eventually be replaced by a committee made up of people’s representatives. The Amildar may then become its chief executive. Who knows?</p>
		<p>I am optimistic about the future. Above everything, our people are brave and just. When the turmoil due to change subsides, I believe that a new system will evolve that will look after the welfare of our people and bring peace and prosperity to our land.</p>
		<p>May God bring peace and prosperity to all, and bring India fame and honor in this world.</p>
		<p>Sarve jana sukhino bhavantu – ‘May everyone in the world be happy!’</p>
		<p>It was a system that had evolved over several centuries of history and tradition, and not something that could be copied overnight as some other princely states tried to do. The period of direct British rule (183181) left the authority and influence of the Amildar undisturbed, and may have even increased it due to the increased remoteness of British officials from the people.</p>
