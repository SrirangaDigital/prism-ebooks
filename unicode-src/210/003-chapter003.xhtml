		<p>The Zurich Polytechnic (now called Eidgenossische Technische Hochshule, ETH) was primarily a teacher training institution with 841 students. Eleven students including Einstein trained in mathematics and physics. He had the generous support of a relative who gave him an allowance of 100 francs a month. Einstein kept aside 20 francs for the future, when he would apply for Swiss citizenship.</p>
		<p>Einstein was to study under Prof. Heinrich Weber, who had previously offered free admission to his lectures on theoretical physics, a new discipline in physics. Einstein, strong in physics, was weak in mathematics. His score in mathematics was around 4 out of 6. Geometry had pulled his score down. Hermann Minkowski, a mathematics professor, often linked physics and mathematics in his lectures. Einstein was greatly impressed and influenced by Minkowski. But observing that he paid little attention to mathematics, Minkowski called him a lazy dog. Later in life, when Einstein was developing his Theory of Relativity, Prof. Minkowski helped him with mathematics.</p>
		<p>Einstein took ten courses in physics offered by Prof. Weber. They were a mixture of lectures and practical work. In the beginning, Einstein liked the courses immensely and his admiration for Weber increased. However, by the end of two years, Einstein was disappointed as he felt that Weber discussed only the relatively older topics in physics. Einstein was more interested in recent developments. James Maxwell, Scottish mathematical physicist, had already published the electromagnetic theory and developed the Maxwell equations in 1855. These for Einstein were the living areas of physics, which he expected Weber to discuss in class. Einstein lost respect for him and was very open about it. The German practice was (and still is) to address professors as Herr Prof (Mr. Prof). But Einstein addressed his teacher as Herr Weber. Annoyed, Weber told Einstein, “You are a clever fellow. But you have one fault. You won’t let anyone tell you a thing.” Einstein paid a heavy price in his later days because of his irreverential attitude.</p>
		<p>Prof. Jean Pernet ran the laboratory classes at the polytechnic, which Einstein hardly attended. Pernet remarked that Einstein should have studied not physics, but medicine or law. Einstein’s characteristic reply was, “I have even less talent for those subjects. Why should I not try my luck in physics?”</p>
		<p>Pernet provided students a detailed instruction sheet for every experiment that was to be performed. While every other student followed the instructions religiously, Einstein would throw the sheet into the waste paper basket and perform the experiment in his own way. This annoyed Pernet; but not the assistant who watched Einstein perform. The assistant remarked, “His solutions are right and the method he uses are of interest.” This is not only an instance of Einstein’s genius in evolving his own methodology but also of his dislike for instructions and blind unthinking adherence to them. In 1899, while performing an experiment, Einstein caused an explosion and injured his right hand. He could not write for nearly two weeks; violin had to wait a bit longer. This could well be a reason for Einstein leaning heavily towards theoretical physics.</p>
		<p>His callous attitude towards discipline and order continued. He did not feel compelled to attend all lectures. When they were not to his liking, he quietly skipped them and went to a coffee club or a concert. In those days, professors lectured not by referring to textbooks as is the case today. Most professors were engaged in research and lectured about their own research and studies. Hence, what was taught in class was for the most part not found in textbooks. Today, students have a variety of sources to make up for lost lectures.</p>

		<p>Luckily Einstein found a good friend in Marcel Grossmann, a Jew, whose father owned a factory near Zurich. Grossmann as a rule attended all lectures and took notes meticulously, which according to Einstein were of publishable quality. Grossmann’s notes are displayed at the Einstein Museum in Bern. Grossmann lent Einstein all these notes and made his life easier. The two took long walks and discussed philosophy at Cafe Metropole on the banks of River Limmat. Theirs was a lifelong friendship; Grossmann helped Einstein find a job after he completed polytechnic. Friedrich Adler, whose father was the leader of Austria’s Social Democratic Party, was another colleague of Einstein.</p>
		<p>Einstein took it upon himself to make up for all that the teachers did not teach in the polytechnic. He made a serious study of the masters of theoretical physics such as Kirchhoff (radiation), Helmholtz (thermodynamics), Hertz (electromagnetism) and Boltzmann (statistical mechanics). He mastered the electromagnetic theory. Einstein also read the works of two other scientists, August Foppl and Henri Poincare. Foppl states that motion can only be defined relative to another body. Poincare came very close to formulating the Theory of Relativity stating there was nothing absolute in mechanics. No doubt, these works had a profound influence on Einstein’s future research.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Outside the Polytechnic</h2>
			<p>One afternoon Einstein was sitting in the lounge when he heard someone playing Mozart’s sonatas on the piano. He learnt from his landlady that it was the old lady next door, also a piano teacher. The music was an invitation in disguise for Einstein. He at once took his violin and rushed next door. The landlady cautioned him that he wore no tie or collar and it was improper to pay a visit dressed casually. Einstein did not seem to care. He went and accompanied the old lady on the violin much to her surprise.</p>
			<p>Einstein came across another music lover in Zurich, a young girl named Suzanne Markwalder. Her mother organised music sessions at home. Einstein actively participated on his violin. He even corrected her piano playing at times. Sailing was another pastime he pursued in Zurich.</p>
			<p>By now, Einstein had already earned the epithet of ‘absent minded professor’. He was least interested in dressing appropriately for various occasions. Forgetfulness had already become a characteristic. He would visit friends and relatives and return without his suitcase. Forgetting his house keys was a daily affair.</p>
			<p>Out of sight and out of mind. Marie Winteler slowly receded from Einstein’s mind. When he started the polytechnic course their love was still strong. In fact, Einstein would send her a basketful of soiled clothes to be washed and returned. The baskets were accompanied by Einstein’s letters on one way and by Marie’s on the return path. But slowly, the baskets that Marie received had only clothes and no letters. Obviously upset she begged that Einstein write as well. He did write to her, but to ask her to forget him! Einstein also wrote to Marie’s mother calling off the relationship. Marie was depressed. However, she recovered and married the manager of a watch factory.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Mileva Marić</h2>
			<p>What led Einstein to break his relationship with Marie so suddenly? Mileva Marić seems to be the reason. She joined the polytechnic at the same time as Einstein and was three years older than he. It was not physical beauty that attracted Einstein to Mileva. She had a congenital hip dislocation and limped. But like Einstein she loved science and mathematics. She was very intelligent and so the relationship started on an intellectual plane.</p>
			<p>Mileva was the daughter of Serbian peasants Milos Marić and Marija Marić and belonged to the Greek orthodox faith; she was born in 1875 in the province of Vojvodina, then in Hungary. She was proficient in both Serbian and German. Her father wanted to educate her in science and mathematics. Having done very well at school, Mileva obtained admission into the polytechnic. She had started studying medicine but changed her mind and transferred to physics. She was the only girl in Einstein’s class. She too liked music and was a talented pianist.</p>

			<p>People have wondered as to what brought them together. Mileva was very moody and had quite a temper. Then, perhaps it was her intellectual capability and independent nature? The two were equals in many senses and read important works on physics together. Initially she saw Einstein as an intellectual companion and not as a lover. By the start of the second year however, the two were hiking together. But something seems to have upset Mileva. She quit Zurich and moved to Heidelberg where she attended the course without taking exams. She studied the Kinetic Theory of Gases and wrote to Einstein apprising him the progress in her learning. A trace of romance was not absent in the letters the two exchanged. Einstein craved for her companionship. Within a year he convinced her to return to Zurich.</p>
			<p>As she had been away for a year, Mileva had quite a bit of catching up to do. Einstein offered to help her. Grossmann’s notes proved very useful. Textbooks were shared. She started living in an apartment close to Einstein’s. As was Einstein’s habit, he misplaced his house keys and had to stay out of his apartment. The easiest solution was to study in Mileva’s apartment. On the next occasion, the key was not lost, but Einstein preferred to study in her room. She did not object! What happened next is easy to guess. Their friendship grew deeper than a mere collaboration. Their letters were now filled with romantic content.</p>
			<p>During July 1900, the summer of his fourth year at the polytechnic, Einstein holidayed with his mother and sister at Hotel Paradise in a place called Melchtal near Zurich. During this period he devoted the first half of the day to studies, and played the violin in the afternoons; his mother’s friends were his audience. Einstein’s mother was pleased with the appreciation that he received. But she was unhappy that her son courted Mileva. Cleverly, Einstein used his violin to console his mother and encourage her to accept Mileva. He tried a similar trick with his father. He visited Hermann in Milan and toured his works. His father’s business was steadily improving now.</p>
			<p>It was during this holiday that Einstein’s mother discovered that the relationship between her son and Mileva had grown very strong and was on the brink of the next logical step. She also learnt that her son called her Dollie. When she asked Einstein, “What will become of your Dollie now?” he had answered, “My wife”. His mother threw herself on the bed, buried her head in the pillow and wept like a child. Then she cautioned, “You are ruining your future and destroying your opportunities.” Such advice continued all through the holiday. “Like you, she is a book; but you ought to have a wife.” “She is 24, you are 21. By the time you are 30, she will be an old witch.” His father opined that a relationship could become meaningful only when the man could afford a decent living.</p>
			<p>During his holidays, Einstein was determined to study the motion of earth through ether. It was believed that all space including the earth’s atmosphere was filled with a substance called ether, which, however, was disproved later. He also tried to consolidate everything he had learnt in physics.</p>
			<p>Einstein had to write two examinations for his diploma. He stood first in one exam with a score of 5.7 out of 6, while Grossmann obtained 5.6. The second was scored on the basis of a thesis. Einstein wanted to further research the motion of earth through ether. His idea was to reflect a beam of light in two directions; one, along earth’s motion and the other, perpendicular to the direction of the earth’s motion. He wanted to record the speed of light in both cases. If ether existed, the two speeds would be different. Prof. Weber, who was to approve and grade the thesis, did not like the topic. There may also have been a lapse on Einstein’s part. Two American scientists, Michelson and Morley, had already performed such an experiment and concluded that the speed of light remained the same in both the cases; there was no evidence to prove the presence of ether.</p>
			<p>Einstein put forth a different proposal; to study the conduction of heat and electricity in metals. Weber dismissed this idea as well. Einstein ended up performing an experiment on heat conduction. Mileva too had chosen the same topic. Einstein and Mileva scored 4.5 and 4 respectively, the lowest grades in class. Grossmann scored 5.5. Einstein’s thesis was rejected on the grounds that it was not written on the specified quality of paper. He had to copy his writing onto the specified type of paper.</p>
			<p>For his overall performance Einstein obtained 4.9 and stood fourth in class. So he graduated with a diploma in 1900. Mileva was not lucky. She had to repeat the year, as she had obtained a score of only 4 and had failed in astronomy and mathematics.</p>
			<p>Einstein applied for Swiss citizenship. The Swiss authorities scrutinised his records thoroughly, including information about his parents. His application was accepted. Einstein retained the Swiss nationality status though he later obtained citizenship of other countries. Now there was no escape; he had to offer himself for military service with the Swiss army. However, a medical examination revealed that he had flat, sweaty feet and varicose veins. He was rejected, and wasn’t he relieved!</p>
