		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Hunt For A Job</h1>
		<p>Initially, Einstein also had to job hunt; after all, he was not famous yet. A diploma was in his pocket. What next? - was the question. This to a certain extent had already been answered. He had chosen physics as his subject for study and an academic life was the only answer. He aimed to obtain a Ph.D. and seek the position of a junior professor in a university and climb the academic ladder.</p>
		<p>However, getting a job proved difficult for Einstein because of the reputation he had created for himself among the community of his polytechnic Professors. The standard procedure to apply for an academic position included furnishing recommendations and references from Professors with whom the candidate has worked. Add to this, a list of publications. No professor was even remotely inclined to give a recommendation or a reference. Einstein realized the futility of requesting Prof. Weber, who was his supervisor. Prof. Pernet was also out of question. Einstein considered Prof. Hurwitz who taught mathematics. But he had slipped out of his lectures too! A job seeking student had to meet his professor and formally request him for a recommendation. But, Einstein decided to write to Hurwitz. The letter was naïve, stating that he had missed Hurwitz’s mathematics lectures because he had liked physics more. Having stated thus, he still hoped for a reply! Of course Hurwitz did not respond. Thus, Einstein was the only one in class who was still looking for a placement despite obtaining a diploma from the Zurich Polytechnic. It is interesting to note that Weber hired two engineering students as his assistants, totally ignoring Einstein. Apparently, he had also convinced many other Professors to reject Einstein. As one of his friends has observed, “His sharp tongue and the fact that he was Jew,” may have been the other reasons.</p>
		<p>Einstein was twenty one. His allowance from his relatives had stopped. A job was imperative to support himself and to marry Mileva. He was looking for a job as an assistant to a professor, so that he could also undertake to do a Ph.D. with him. There seemed no way out. Einstein found himself doing odd jobs such as tutoring, helping others with their calculations and occasional teaching jobs in schools to earn a livelihood.</p>
		<p>Einstein’s thought process however was very active. He wrote a paper on Capillary Action and published it in the reputed German Journal Annalen der Physik. He hoped it would attract the attention of important Professors; however, they were rather autocratic in those days and were not very approachable. Fully aware of this, Einstein sent a copy to Prof. Wilhelm Ostwald of the University of Leipzig, a forerunner in the area of physical chemistry and a Nobel Prize recipient. As can be expected, he received no reply. Einstein sent him reminders, but in vain. When his father Hermann discovered his son’s agony, he wrote to Prof. Ostwald begging for help. A reply did arrive, but with no offer of an appointment. Ironically enough, it was Prof. Ostwald who nominated Einstein for the Nobel Prize nine years later! Einstein tried his luck with Prof. Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes of Netherlands, but in vain. In any case, Einstein himself later dismissed this paper as worthless.</p>
		<p>Einstein had bought many reply-paid post cards. He sent one such post card and a copy of his paper, with every request he made. Though he received no replies, these cards are now exhibited in museums and are protected as collectors’ items. He wrote to Professors in places as remote as Italy. He jokingly remarked, “I will have soon graced every physicist from North Sea to the southern tip of Italy with my offer.” He would not give up. He said, “I leave no stone unturned and do not give up my sense of humour. God created the donkey and gave him a thick skin.”</p>
		<p>Einstein’s close friend Michele Angelo Besso from Italy tried to help him. But nothing came out of it.</p>
		<p>His passion for music did not wane, nor did his pursuit of physics. But his inability to gain employment depressed him and a sense of worthlessness engulfed him.</p>
		<p>Marcel Grossmann, who had once helped Einstein by offering his notes, came to his rescue again. Grossmann sought help from his father, an influential man, who at once recommended Einstein to meet Haller, the Director of the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</p>

		<p>The meeting, almost an interview, between Einstein and Haller lasted more than two hours. Einstein was not equipped for this job; he had none of the technical skills. The conversation must have turned to physics at some point, which was to Einstein’s advantage. Haller was thrilled that Einstein was already a master of James Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory and immediately offered him a position. However, there was no vacancy and by law it had to be advertised. So Einstein had to wait.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, Einstein worked as a substitute teacher. He also tutored a few private students. Remarkably, working as a teacher in a technical school at Winterthur, he wrote a paper on thermodynamics which was later accepted by the journal Annalen der Physik. He submitted the same for a doctorate at the University of Zurich, which was turned down by Professor Alfred Kleiner. Einstein had made bold statements in the thesis and had challenged well-known scientists such as Boltzmann and Drude. Kleiner respected these two scientists and hence did not approve of Einstein challenging them. However, even this notable work is secondary compared to Einstein’s future contributions.</p>
		<p>“The candidates need not have a doctorate. But they must have mechanical training and also know physics,” said the newspaper advertisement from the patent office in December, 1901. No doubt it was specially tailored for Einstein. Needless to say, he did apply and was appointed as an engineer, third class. He immediately moved to Bern. But he had to wait for six months before he could take up this position. He continued his tutoring jobs.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein’s Daughter</h2>
			<p>It was during this period that one of the lesser known events in Einstein’s life occurred. It came to light only in 1986. A daughter was born to Mileva and Einstein. Mileva delivered at her parent’s place in Novi Sad in early 1902 and the baby was named Lieserl. A child born out of wedlock was not uncommon in Europe those days. There is no record to tell us whether Einstein saw his daughter at all. There is no mention of her in any of his statements or conversations. However, scholars have found letters he wrote to Mileva, eagerly enquiring about Lieserl.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s parents Hermann and Pauline never thought that they would have a granddaughter this way. They expected Albert to marry Mileva. Pauline was totally against it and would do anything to prevent it. She even wrote to Mileva’s parents denouncing the possible marriage.</p>
			<p>Mileva never brought Lieserl to live with her and Einstein, even though he had elaborate plans for a big house for the three of them. She felt that it was not wise for a Swiss civil servant to live with a woman he is not married to, and a child. She would rather wait for Einstein to marry her. They did get married soon, but Lieserl remained in the background. Apparently she was raised by Helene Kaufler Savic, Mileva’s friend.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">A Job at Last</h2>
			<p>June 23, 1902. It was a great day in Einstein’s life. He was finally employed! He started work at the patent office. He was called a Technical Expert, third class, with a salary of 3500 Swiss francs a year. The salary was reasonable; a junior professor in the university earned less.</p>

			<p>His office was situated where the Post and Telegraph office is situated today, in the old part of Bern near the historic clock erected in 1191 that the city still boasts of. Einstein passed by it every day on his way to work. The clock served as a time keeper for the trains that went through the Bern Train Station located nearby.</p>
			<p>His daily routine was to work from 8 am for 8 hours. Patents were submitted for approval. Einstein was in charge of investigating the applications. His boss Haller had suggested that Einstein be meticulous and cautious and assume at the outset that every inventor was lying!</p>
			<p>In reality, this work did not require 8 hours of his attention every day. He was able to finish his daily schedule in two or three hours. The rest of the day was dedicated to physics. He was able to think and involve himself in scientific study and work on his calculations. When he heard footsteps he would just hide the papers. In fact, Haller was aware of it and would laugh it away.</p>
			<p>The nature of work seemed well suited to him. Among others, were applications to patent methods for synchronising clocks and coordinating time using signals which travelled at the speed of light. We will soon see that time and light and its speed play a very important role in Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.</p>
			<p>Einstein began to like his office. He could concentrate on his research without being forced into it. Here, he was under no pressure to write papers, in sharp contrast with university discipline, where Professors had to write as many papers as possible in a year, forcing them to publish sub-standard papers just to fulfil requirements. “An academic career in which a person is forced to produce scientific writings in great amounts creates a danger of intellectual superficiality,” Einstein would say.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Academy</h2>
			<p>By Easter of 1902, Einstein offered to tutor students in his spare time and accordingly placed an advertisement in the newspapers –</p>
			<p class="myquote">
				"Private Lessons in<br />
				MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS<br />
				for students and pupils<br />
				given most thoroughly by<br />
				ALBERT EINSTEIN, holder of the fed.<br />
				Polyt. Teacher’s diploma,<br />
				GERECHTIGKEITSGASSE 32, 1st FLOOR,<br />
				Trial lessons free.”
			</p>
			<p>This ad attracted Maurice Solovine, a Romanian studying philosophy at the University of Bern. He had not yet decided whether to continue with philosophy or change to physics. He thought of seeking Einstein’s help. The two met for the first time in Einstein’s house. Solovine was very impressed by his large eyes. The two talked for nearly two hours, and continued the conversation for another half hour walking down a quiet street. By the third meeting, Einstein had decided that Solovine did not need any tutoring in physics. He invited Solovine to join him in his study of some of the works of great thinkers. They were no more student and teacher; they were colleagues.</p>
			<p>Conrad Habicht, a former student of mathematics at the Zurich Polytechnic was the next to join them. The trio called themselves the ‘Olympia Academy’. Einstein, though the youngest, was chosen the president. They even came up with a certificate with a dedication. The three made good company. On the occasion of his seventy-fourth birthday, Einstein paid rich tribute to their friendship in his speech.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Einstein, with Habicht and Solovine</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The Academy met mostly at Einstein’s apartment and occasionally at Solovine’s or Habicht’s house. The meeting was followed by dinner, usually consisting of sausage, cheese, fruits and tea. An exception was made for the president’s (Einstein) birthday when a large amount of caviar was bought. After dinner and discussion, Einstein would play his violin. The meetings ran well into the night much to the annoyance of the neighbours. The three particularly liked to go to the mountains near Bern in summer. They would watch the sunrise from the top of the mountains, wait for coffee shops to open and after a strong cup of black coffee, they would head for work.</p>
			<p>Once, Solovine wanted to attend a violin concert and hence could not be present for the meeting of the Academy at his own house. Being the host, he cooked eggs for his guests and left a note on the table, “Hard boiled eggs and a salutation.” Einstein and Habicht met as usual and decided to take revenge on Solovine for his absence. Solovine did not like smoking. The two smoked their pipes to their hearts’ content and dropped ashes everywhere in the apartment and left a note, “Thick smoke and a salutation!”</p>
			<p>It should not be construed that the Academy was interested only in physics or science. Its interests were varied. The three together read literary masterpieces including the Greek play Antigone by Sophocles, and Don Quixote by Cervantes; many philosophical works including David Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature, Ernst Mach’s Analysis of Sensations, Mechanics and Its Development, Baruch Spinoza’s Ethics and Henri Poincare’s Science and Hypothesis.</p>
			<p>Hume is sceptical about any knowledge other than that which can be perceived through sense organs. Even causality, the study of the relationship between cause and effect, is questionable. According to him, we perceive time only through a succession of ideas and impressions. Time on its own does not exist. Hume’s perceptions echo the fundamentals of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.</p>
			<p>Kant was not new to Einstein. In fact, he had read Kant in his school days. Kant talks about two types of truths--Analytic and Synthetic. Three times seven is twenty one is an Analytic truth. On the other hand, Synthetic truth is observation-based. Bangalore is bigger than Mysore is an example. Einstein in the coming years dismissed this classification. For example, the fact that the sum of three angles of a triangle is 180° is true only in Euclidian geometry. In curved space the answer is different. So it is not an Analytic truth.</p>
			<p>According to Mach, concepts have meaning only if objects to which they refer and the rules by which they are assigned to these objects are discernable. This calls for an operational definition of any concept and an explanation of how to observe it in operation. Mach found that it was impossible to define concepts of absolute space and absolute time like Newton.</p>
			<p>Spinoza believed in a God reflected in beauty, order and unity of nature’s laws. Einstein liked his concept of a God who neither punishes human beings for their mistakes and sins nor rewards them for righteous acts.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s scientific philosophy was shaped through such meetings and discussions. However, it was fun that kept the Academy going. Unfortunately, it was short lived. Habicht left Bern in 1904 to become a school teacher in Schaffhausen in Swiss. Solovine left the year after and settled down in Paris to work as editor and writer. He later undertook to translate Einstein’s works into French.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein weds</h2>
			<p>Einstein had a job which fetched him a good income. Marriage seemed to be the next obvious step.</p>
			<p>By October 1902, Einstein’s father Hermann’s health was failing. One day the entire family including Albert assembled near his bedside. But Hermann ordered everyone out before dying. Einstein was upset even though he had only a weak bond with his father. He said that his father’s death was the deepest shock he ever experienced. But there was something to be happy about. On his deathbed, Hermann gave Albert the permission to marry Mileva.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Mileva and Einstein</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The wedding of Albert Einstein and Mileva Marić was solemnised on January 6, 1903 at the registrar’s office in Bern with Solovine and Habicht as witnesses. It was an Academy affair. None of Einstein’s or Mileva’s relatives were present. The wedding party was a dinner at a nearby restaurant in the evening. Thereafter, the newlyweds went to Einstein’s apartment only to discover that he had forgotten his key (surely, not for the first time). The landlady had to be woken up.</p>
			<p>Now that he was married, Einstein was supremely happy. He wrote to Besso, “Well, now I am a married man and I am living a pleasant cosy life with my wife. …. She takes excellent care of everything, cooks well, and is always cheerful.”</p>
			<p>This turns out to be the declarations of a newly married, exuberant young man. We find that the joy was short lived. As the couple began to settle down, Mileva was absorbed in house work and found no time for her studies. She became a silent spectator at the Academy and also distrustful of Einstein at times. Einstein would recall later that he had an inner resistance which urged him not to marry her, but he had done so as a sense of duty.</p>
			<p>There were many differences between them. First of all, Mileva was not happy that Einstein was a public civil servant. She wanted him to be an academic and engage in research. If that was not possible, she wished he taught at some school. If not Switzerland, he could do so in her country, maybe in Belgrade. Then there was bad news. Their daughter Lieserl, then 19 months old, fell ill with scarlet fever. Mileva rushed to her hometown. Little is known about the poor child. It is believed that she was given up for adoption but no records are available to prove it.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Young Hans and Mileva</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Curiously enough, all the letters in this regard exchanged between Einstein and Mileva and those between Mileva and the caretaker Savic have been destroyed. It is believed that Lieserl was alive in 1903 and may have been adopted by Savic herself. In any case, Mileva lived all her life with this secret hidden inside her. She never spoke about it even though she was advised by friends to doso.</p>
			<p>The time to get over Lieserl came very quickly. Mileva gave birth to a boy on May 14, 1904. He was named Hans Albert Einstein. A joyous Einstein assumed a paternal role looking after his son. He made toys using matchboxes and string. “He could make the most beautiful things,” recollects Hans.</p>
			<p>Mileva’s father Milos Marić was thrilled to learn that he was now grandfather to a boy. He rushed to Bern to visit the child. He offered a dowry of 100,000 francs to Einstein who refused it saying, “I did not marry your daughter for money.” Einstein, no longer on probation, was financially more secure.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>His enquiry into physics never stopped. In the hustle and bustle of life as a married man, Einstein wrote another paper, his third, which was published in Annalen der Physik. Subsequently he wrote a fourth paper. By now Einstein had set high standards in research. He was determined to become a privatdozent (one who pursues an academic career holding all the qualifications to become a professor). His fourth as well as fifth papers were published in the same journal. Some of the patent applications that Einstein examined were trying to promote perpetual motion machines. He knew very well that they would not work because they violated the second law of thermodynamics. To improve his knowledge of the subject, he studied the contributions of Boltzmann and Gibbs in the field of thermodynamics. And he went beyond them. This formed the theme for his next papers.</p>
