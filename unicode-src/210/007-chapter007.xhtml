			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Zurich</h2>
			<p>Zurich was not new to the Einstein couple. It was the town where the two had spent their student days; they were happy to be back there. Besides, they had the company of good friends. Adler and his wife lived in an apartment close to the Einsteins. Einstein and Adler met regularly to discuss philosophy and physics in the attic of a building nearby, undisturbed by children and wives.</p>
			<p>Whenever Einstein needed help in geometry or calculus, he consulted his friend Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics at Zurich Polytechnic. Adolf Hurwitz, whose classes Einstein had skipped, was still there as a distinguished professor of mathematics. The two reunited not to discuss mathematics, but to perform music. Hurwitz held concerts at his house on Sundays. Einstein attended them regularly. He also helped Hurwitz’s daughter with her math homework.</p>
			<p>Einstein was very different from the German professors of those days. His lectures were as unique as his attire. He wore shabby trousers too short for him. Einstein did not lecture from meticulously prepared notes in the traditional style. He scribbled on small pieces of paper. His thoughts developed as he spoke, providing students the unique opportunity of watching the great master in action. He paused now and then to make sure students followed him and encouraged them to interrupt and ask questions; very unusual for a German professor of those times. Sometimes, Einstein converted the class into a discussion group, encouraging students to talk.</p>
			<p>After the formal classroom sessions, the meetings continued in Cafe Terrace. Discussions ended only when the cafe closed for the day. Many times these discussions resumed at his home. Once he discussed a paper by Max Planck with his students in his apartment. Students could find no mistake in it but Einstein could. Students suggested they should write to Planck drawing his attention to it. Einstein would not do so as he revered Planck. So, he said, “The result is correct; the mistake is in the proof. Let us send him the correct proof.” He had the rare insight to identify at once the physics that was hidden behind a given mathematical formula. For most people, a formula was an abstract entity.</p>
			<p>Einstein was about to complete his first year as an academic at Zurich when his second son Eduard was born in July 1910. Mileva was very sick following childbirth. It was suggested she hire a house maid to manage home chores. Her response was, “Isn’t it clear to anyone that my husband works himself half dead?” Instead of hiring a maid, she sought her mother’s help which was readily available.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Indeed, Einstein’s first love was physics and many a time, family and friends fell far behind. His scientific engagement flowed like a dauntless river without caring for its banks. Yet he loved his children dearly. His son Hans has recalled that when his mother was busy around the house, father would put aside his work and watch them for hours, bouncing them on his knees. He would tell stories. He often played violin in an effort to keep them quiet. Nevertheless, at times, he was also capable of ignoring their cries and carrying on with his work. Tanner, a student, recalls that once when he had come to meet Einstein at home, he found him pouring over a pile of papers. He held Eduard in his left hand while writing with his right. Hans was playing and still sought attention. As soon as Einstein saw Tanner, he passed Eduard to him and continued scribbling equations.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Prague</h2>
			<p>Einstein was only an Associate Professor at Zurich. In March 1910, he was offered full professorship at the German part of University of Prague. During those days Prague was a part of the Austro Hungarian Empire. He had always hoped to become a full-fledged professor in some university. The opportunity finally presented itself. Soon the word spread across the University of Zurich. Fifteen students led by Tanner submitted a memorandum to the authorities demanding Einstein’s retention in Zurich and as Head of Theoretical Physics. According to them, Einstein had the amazing talent of presenting the most difficult problems of theoretical physics in a clear lucid style; that it was a great delight to follow his lectures; and that he was so good at establishing rapport with his audience. Giving into this demand, the authorities increased Einstein’s salary to 5500 francs a year. But Einstein was quite convinced about choosing professorship and did not stay back.</p>
			<p>It was not smooth sailing towards Prague. Max Planck had given a strong recommendation for Einstein. But there was a contender, Gustav Baumann, who had the benefit of being an Austrian and a non-Jew. But he was placed second in the shortlist of candidates. When he learnt of this, he fumed, unwilling to accept a position second to Einstein in the merit list.</p>
			<p>Religion also came in the way. Einstein was fond of saying that he belonged to no religion. But the emperor had mandated everyone in his empire to belong to a religion. To quieten the authorities Einstein declared that his religion was mosaic and agreed to accept Austro Hungarian citizenship. As a result he was appointed to the position at almost double the current salary. He was now a full Professor.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Einstein felt that he should personally meet Mach and Lorentz, his heroes of science. He did so before leaving for Prague. Earlier, Mach and he had engaged in an intellectual battle about the existence of the atom. Einstein regarded Lorentz as a guru and went with Mileva to see him in Leiden, Holland where he lived. The two men met often during this trip. Einstein says, “Lorentz meant more to me personally than anybody else that I have met in my life.”</p>
			<p>Mileva hated the idea of moving to Prague. We do not know whether Einstein liked it or not, but he sure wanted the academic position. He seemed to have liked the people there, but Mileva complained of the city being dirty and the people being haughty.</p>
			<p>The family became acquainted with a lady called Bertha Fanta who was interested in music and literature and organised get-togethers for the Jews of Prague. Einstein met many intellectuals such as Franz Kafka (author of novels such as The Trial, The Castle among others) and Max Brod (author, composer and journalist). During these meetings Einstein discussed the philosophy of Immanuel Kant or played music.</p>

			<p>Paul Ehrenfest, a physicist from Vienna working in St. Petersburg in Russia, contacted Einstein and requested him to find him a suitable professional position. Einstein responded and invited him to Prague to spend a few days with him. When Ehrenfest arrived, Einstein and Mileva met him at the train station. Soon after Mileva left them and headed home, Einstein and Ehrenfest became absorbed in the discussion of physics. They established a good rapport. During the seven days that he stayed in Prague, Einstein updated him with the details of his General Theory of Relativity. Ehrenfest accompanied the Einstein family on the piano when they performed Brahms.</p>

			<p>Einstein was already contemplating on leaving Prague and was happy for Ehrenfest to take over his position. But the latter was reluctant to affiliate himself with any religion, even though it was one of the prerequisites to join the University of Prague.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Lorentz in Leiden was preparing for his retirement by cutting down on his lectures. A replacement was warranted. Einstein was approached as a possible candidate, but he refused. As a result, the position was offered to Ehrenfest. Thus, Einstein and Ehrenfest met often. In 1933, history took a new turn with Hitler coming to power.</p>
			<p>The Solvay Congress was a prestigious meeting place for physicists and scientists. A Belgian chemist and industrialist, Ernest Solvay, made an abundant amount of money by manufacturing soda. He was also interested in the theories of physics. To spend his money usefully he organised a meeting of leading physicists towards the end of 1911 at the Grand Hotel Metropole in Brussels. Twenty of the great physicists of the day participated. Hendrik Lorenz, Einstein, Marie Curie, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Walther Nernst, Wilhem Wien and Henri Poincare were the foremost among the delegates who met and discussed the Quantum Problem.</p>
			<p>At the Congress, Einstein insisted that light travels in small packets called quanta, which contradicted Maxwell’s theory. He faced intense opposition from Planck, Poincare and Lorentz. He confessed that the quantum hypothesis did violate Maxwell’s theory and that it was only a provisional hypothesis.</p>

			<p>Nothing positive came out of the Congress for Einstein except that it launched him as a leading physicist of Europe. He also met Marie Curie and Paul Langevin who became good friends.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Elsa</h2>
			<p>Mileva had hoped that she would be a scientist on par with her husband. As time passed and her domestic responsibilities increased, her ambition was forced to the back burner. She was reduced to being a housewife. Einstein made no effort to elevate her in any way. While in Prague, he gained recognition from several quarters. He travelled all over Europe propagating his theories. Mileva felt neglected. A family friend hinted that she had probably become schizophrenic; Einstein confessed that he thought so too. Their marriage was on the rocks.</p>
			<p>It was under these circumstances that Einstein met Elsa in Berlin during the Easter holidays of 1912. She was related to him both through his father and his mother, a cousin from both sides. She was not entirely new to him. The two had played together as kids in Munich. She was now aged 36, married and divorced, with two daughters, Margot and Ilse.</p>
			<p>Einstein was looking for a companion and it seemed to him that Elsa could provide everything Mileva could not. The two women were diametrically opposite in nature. Mileva was intelligent and complex, while Elsa was very conventional, pretty and caring. There was chemistry between Elsa and Einstein. Love bloomed. They began writing to each other.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/060.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Elsa</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Einstein succumbed easily. In one of his letters, he wrote, “I have to have someone to love, otherwise life is miserable. And this someone is you.”</p>
			<p>Einstein’s surrender was so complete that he even considered moving to Berlin. An invitation or an opportunity was all he needed.</p>
			<p>His relationship with Mileva worsened after he returned to Prague. However, he was cautious and did not intend to break away from her at once. So, he wrote to Elsa saying that it was better if they did not correspond.</p>
			<p>Prague turned out to be an unsuitable place for Einstein and Mileva. They each developed their grievances. Water was bad; milk and air were unhealthy, especially for their second son Eduard, who lost his appetite as a consequence; the people of Prague were snobbish with no good will for others. In short, it was time to moveon.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Back to Zurich</h2>
			<p>Einstein was now a well-known physicist and could almost choose the place where he wanted to work. His friend, Grossmann, was trying his best, with the help of his colleagues, to get him back to Zurich. The Polytechnic, where he had worked before was now a university capable of awarding degrees.</p>
			<p>Einstein already had two offers, from Leiden and Utrecht. He rejected both, assured that the Zurich offer would come through. However, there was reluctance on the part of some officials in Zurich Polytechnic, who were not in favour of an exclusive chair for theoretical physics. One of Einstein’s friends, a medical researcher, Heinrich Zangger, advised the university that a faculty member for theoretical physics was a necessity and that it required no laboratory. This meant the university would not have to spend much money to maintain Einstein and his studies. He, along with Marie Curie and Poincare strongly recommended Einstein.</p>
			<p>Einstein was appointed with a salary of 10,000 francs per year and a bonus of 1000 francs. Incidentally Einstein had once failed the entrance examination at Zurich Polytechnic. He was back on the streets that he had strolled as a young man, the coffee clubs he had frequented and the country he had enjoyed. It was the place where he had met Mileva and and fallen in love with her. Now he was back in a familiar setting, he could settle down and continue with his research.</p>
			<p>The joy of moving back to Zurich was shared by Mileva and the children as well. The family rented a six bedroom apartment with magnificent views. Einstein was happy to be reunited with Grossmann and Zangger. Einstein was secretly relieved that Prof. Weber was now dead. Not that he would have interfered with Einstein in any way, if he were alive.</p>
			<p>His colleagues included Planck, Nernst, Haber and Freundlich with whom he had been corresponding all this while. Freundlich set himself to verify the General Theory of Relativity by measuring the deflection of a ray of light from a distant star. Later he was placed in charge of building the Einstein Tower near Potsdam in Berlin.</p>
			<p>Sunday afternoon concerts at the residence of Hurwitz continued. Now in the presence of the Einstein family, Mozart and Schumann became alive again.</p>
			<p>Contrary to expectations, Mileva’s health did not improve. She suffered from rheumatism. Either she stayed away from the concerts or remained aloof when she attended them.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, Elsa resumed writing to Einstein. She wanted to be with him somehow. On his thirty-fourth birthday he received a greeting from her. She requested him to suggest a good book on Relativity and to send her his picture. Einstein replied that there was no good book on Relativity he could suggest. He offered to take her on a long walk and explain Relativity himself. Besides, since he himself was going to appear before her, there was no need to send a picture, Eventually, he sent a picture of himself as requested.</p>
			<p>Einstein was not destined to stay in Zurich for long. A great opportunity came knocking on his door.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Please come to Berlin</h2>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Max Planck</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>On July 11, 1913, Einstein had two distinguished visitors, Max planck and Walther Nernst, who came with the attractive proposal of a position at the Pussian Academy of Sciences. He was also offered the directorship of the newly established Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Theoretical Physics and professorship at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin. These positions carried handsome salaries. At the same time, he would not be compelled to teach or carry out any administrative duties. A proposal too attractive to refuse! The only condition imposed was that he should accept German citizenship again while retaining his Swiss citizenship.</p>
			<p>Einstein did not accept the offer outright and asked for a few hours’ time to think about it. The two scientists had come with their wives and they decided to go to nearby Mount Rigi for an excursion. They hinted that by the time they returned, Einstein would have to make up his mind. Einstein indicated that he would meet them at the train station on their return. If he held a red rose it would mean that he had accepted the offer. A white rose meant refusal. When they returned there was a smiling Einstein holding a red rose!</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/062b.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Walther Nernst</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The Academy would not appoint Einstein at once. It sought opinion from the leading physicists of Germany about him. In reply they wrote, “There is no great problem in modern physics to which Einstein has not made a significant contribution.” Indeed, a great praise to be bestowed upon a contemporary scientist. Einstein, on the other hand, though publishing papers ceaselessly, wondered whether he could always lay a golden egg. He was appointed with twenty one votes in favour and one abstention, and was awarded a salary of 12,000 marks a year.</p>
			<p>Einstein was wondering if it was wise to leave Zurich, considering that his family and he had well-adjusted to the city. Besides, he now had to embrace German citizenship which he had thrown away only a few years before.</p>
			<p>Historians have discussed the pros and cons of Einstein’s move to Berlin. But one factor outweighed all other considerations--Elsa. Einstein saw this as a golden opportunity to unite with her and have a much better family life. He told one of his friends, “She was the main reason for my going to Berlin.” What lends support to this belief is that Einstein wrote a letter to Elsa, immediately after Planck and Nernst left him. He wrote, “I will be coming over to Berlin by spring next year. I am already enjoying the lovely hours we can have together.”</p>
			<p>What goes on behind the scene is always very interesting. Elsa put in a word through the industrialist Fritz Haber, a Nobel laureate who had discovered a process to synthesise ammonia and ran the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry. “Einstein will accept the position if offered”. One cannot be sure whether this really mattered, for it appears, Einstein would have been appointed anyway.</p>
			<p>Elsa already assumed she was married to Einstein and started advising him on matters of diet and exercise. He, for his part, did not hide his feelings--he longed to be with her soon. At the same time he cautioned Elsa that he was not prepared to abandon his wife Mileva.</p>
			<p>In August 1913, Einstein planned a vacation with his family near Lake Como in Switzerland. Marie Curie and her daughters joined them. Einstein’s son Eduard fell sick, so Mileva made arrangements for him to be placed elsewhere. Following this the Einstein family went to Mileva’s parents’ place in Novi Sad. His children Hans and Eduard were baptised. He did not care whether his children were baptised or not. From here, after a short stay in Vienna, Einstein went to Berlin to be with Elsa. She was very clear in what she wanted--“Divorce Mileva and marry me”. Einstein was not ready for this.</p>
			<p>Mileva, as can be expected, hated the idea of moving to Berlin where there were three people she disliked--Elsa, Pauline (Einstein’s mother) and Maja (Einstein’s sister). But Elsa and the General Theory of Relativity were Einstein’s retreats. Before they moved to Berlin, Eduard developed an infection. Mileva had to take him to a resort in the Alps. Einstein, however, felt it necessary to go to Berlin to visit Elsa! He even skipped a conference in Paris to arrive a day earlier.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-007.06">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Berlin</h2>
			<p>Einstein moved to Berlin in April 1914. A large apartment had been selected by Mileva at the heart of the city. She joined him straight from the Alps after Eduard recovered.</p>
			<p>Einstein was busy at work. He had three jobs at hand, apart from the General Theory of Relativity he was working on. Einstein complained to Ehrenfest, when he visited, that family took too much of his time. Mileva was brooding that they should have remained in Zurich.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s attraction to Elsa increased; Mileva became a burden. He even requested his friends Besso, Zanggers and Haber to help in dissolving the marriage. While Einstein remained withdrawn from family and engrossed in work, Mileva felt totally disenchanted. Her dreams of becoming a scientist had melted. Her husband had become a star in physics. As retaliation, she started to hate anything or anybody connected with Einstein, his mother, sister and friends.</p>
			<p>The end came just two months after they settled in Berlin. Mileva took their children and moved away to Haber’s house. It was for Haber to act as a mediator between Einstein and Mileva in the days to follow. Einstein drew up a set of conditions for Mileva, if she wanted to live with him. The document ran as follows:</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-007.07">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Conditions</h2>
			<ol class="upper-alpha">
				<li>You make sure
				<ol>
					<li>That my clothes and laundry are kept in good order and repair;</li>
					<li>That I receive my three meals regularly in my room;</li>
					<li>That my bedroom and office are always kept neat, in particular, that the desk is available <em>to me alone</em>;</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You renounce all personal relations with me as far as maintaining them is not absolutely required for social reasons. Specifically, you do without,
					<ol>
						<li>My sitting at home with you;</li>
						<li>My going out or travelling with you;</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In your relation with me you commit yourself explicitly to adhering to the following points:
					<ol>
						<li>You are neither to expect intimacy from me nor to reproach me in any way;</li>
						<li>You must desist immediately from addressing me, if I request it;</li>
						<li>You must leave my bedroom or office immediately without protest if I so request;</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You commit yourself not to disparage me either in word or in deed in front of my children;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One wonders whether Einstein was in the right frame of mind when he wrote these conditions. It reads like a statement of duties and manners for a secretary rather than requests to a wife. It is very clear that he valued himself and his work more than his family, children included. A wife meant nothing. She was there just to support him and manage his house. It is surprising that Mileva accepted these terms. Einstein went on to make sure that she clearly understood his conditions.</p>
			<p>As can be guessed, being no better than a ceasefire agreement between two rival countries, it did not work. The couple met in Haber’s house very soon on a Friday to formulate the terms of separation. In a meeting that lasted three hours, Einstein offered 5600 marks a year for Mileva to support herself and the children. A lawyer later finalised the deal. Einstein did not go to see the lawyer and deputed his friend Besso to represent him. He found it more fulfilling to go to Elsa’s house. But she was away in the Alps! As per the terms of agreement, Einstein was allowed access to his children at any place not connected with Elsa.</p>
			<p>Mileva decided to return to Zurich and left Berlin on the morning of July 29, 1914. Einstein saw her and his children off at the train station. The dormant paternal instinct surfaced and he wept like a child unable to bear the separation from his kids. Said he, “I have carried these children a number of times, I have taken them in prams and have played with them. They used to shout with joy when I came home. They are gone forever, and their image of their father is being spoiled.”</p>
			<p>Einstein’s mother Pauline felt happy that Mileva was out of the family and that her son, Albert, no longer had anything to do with her. She approved his relationship with Elsa. Elsa’s parents were pleased with the prospect of Einstein becoming their son-in-law. At the same time, they were not happy that he had given away a sizable portion of his salary to Mileva. Elsa renewed her request that Einstein and she get married. Again he declined. He seemed to detest the institution of marriage; to him it was not required. It meant some sort of confinement.</p>
			<p>In the middle of all this turmoil, Einstein continued to concentrate on his scientific pursuit. He was busy working on his General Theory of Relativity. Nothing can describe him better than the following lines from Oliver Goldsmith -</p>
			<p>
				As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,<br />
				Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm,<br />
				Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br />
				Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
			</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The First World War</h2>
			<p>The First World War broke out in August 1914. Einstein and Mileva had separated only a few months before. Patriotism ignited the Germans. Cries of nationalism were heard everywhere. Scientists and the intelligentsia spoke openly and took sides. Einstein was opposed to the war. Like Bertrand Russell, British mathematician and philosopher, he hated the bloodthirstiness among the so called patriots. He believed in Internationalism which he had envisioned in Aarau, thanks to Winteler.</p>
			<p>His close friends and colleagues, Planck, Nernst and Haber were ready to cooperate with the German government and the army to uphold German values. Haber converted to Christianity. He discovered a process to synthesize Ammonia, which the Germans used to build explosives. Nernst learnt the army drill and took to testing teargas. Planck openly supported Germany and encouraged his students to participate in the war.</p>
			<p>The intelligentsia of Germany prepared a war petition in support of the government. It was called the Manifesto of the 93, after the 93 intellectuals who signed it. It stressed the necessity of war and claimed that Germany had no involvement in the attack on civilians in Belgium. (In July 1914, Germany invaded the weak and neutral Belgium. After the battle the German soldiers massacred many civilians leading to what is called the Rape of Belgium). The petition was signed by Planck, Nernst and Haber. The other important signatory was Philipp Lenard who had worked on the photoelectric effect and later became Einstein’s enemy. Einstein was not asked to sign the Manifesto as he was a Swiss national; he would not have signed such a petition anyway.</p>
			<p>Einstein, on the other hand, worked on a different manifesto calling for internationalism. His main supporter was another Jew, Georg Nicolai and his manifesto attracted no more than two or three people. Einstein then formed a league and toyed with the idea of a possible United States of Europe, which could unite all European countries and thus prevent future wars. Einstein and Nicolai wrote A Manifesto to Europeans. Only four people, including Einstein and Nicolai signed it. The government quickly banned the league.</p>
			<p>Einstein would not leave it at that. He collaborated with the famous French writer Romain Rolland (winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1915) who was trying to promote a relationship between France and Germany. He also engaged in verbal conflicts with fanatical German scientists such as Paul Hertz. Einstein did not endorse the feelings of the mainstream Germans. He dared to publish an essay 'My Opinion of the War' in the journal of the Goethe League.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Living away from Children</h2>
			<p>Despite an objective and scientific temperament, Einstein found it difficult to be estranged from his children. Hans wrote to his father frequently and kept him abreast of the progress he and his brother were making. Einstein particularly admired Hans’ interest in geometry. While Hans wished his father paid them a visit, Eduard had dreamt that he had indeed made such a visit! Einstein did plan to see his children by the Easter of 1915. War prevented him from doing so. The trip was rescheduled to July.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, letters and angry words were exchanged between Mileva and Einstein. He was totally taken aback when he received a letter from Hans (about eleven years old by now) which read, “If you are unfriendly to mother, I do not want to go with you.” Einstein concluded that Mileva was setting his children against him. Nevertheless, he instructed one of his doctor friends to watch Eduard when he had an ear infection.</p>
			<p>Einstein did visit his family in September that year. Mileva wanted him to stay with her and the children. But Einstein stayed in a hotel and met his friends Besso and Zangger often. He visited his children only twice during his stay of three weeks. Later, Einstein went to the extent of cancelling his trip to see his children for Christmas – “I am too tired because of my work. I cannot sit in the train for two hours and twenty minutes.”</p>
			<p>On his return to Berlin, Einstein checked out of the apartment where he had lived with his family and moved to a smaller one, close to where Elsa lived.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Amazing Theory</h2>
			<p>1915 was an important year for Einstein and for science and history. It was the year physics took a giant leap forward. Einstein gave a new interpretation of gravity. According to him it was not a force that acted between two objects, but a consequence of the distorted space time continuum around the object.</p>
			<p>We have seen that he was busy with his theories all through his life. After proposing his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, he was continually working towards extending it to accelerating systems.</p>
			<p>The Prussian Academy met every week in the Prussian State Library. About fifty members used to assemble and listen to some learned talk. Einstein delivered four lectures in November 1915. It was on the 25<sup>th</sup> of this month, that he presented the paper that shook the scientists of the world – The Field Equations of Gravitation. In this paper, Einstein had presented his General Theory of Relativity. The paper was published in Annalen der Physik the following March.</p>
			<p>It has been hailed as one of history’s most imaginative and dramatic revisions of the concepts of the universe. Extending Newton’s theory, Einstein had developed a theory which was valid at all speeds, even those close to that of light. Space and time were no longer independent as Newton had believed; rather they were inter-dependent. The highlights of the Theory of Relativity are discussed in Part 2 of the book.</p>
			<p>Scientists were astonished, newspapers were thrilled, common men stood amazed. Says Paul Dirac (a pioneer of quantum mechanics and a Nobel Laureate), “Probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made.” Max Born, another Nobel Laureate, says, “Greatest feat of human thinking about nature, the most amazing combination of philosophical penetration, physical intuition and mathematical skill.”</p>
