		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Explosion in Physics</h1>
		<p>We have seen that Einstein made public his theories on Relativity between 1905 and 1915, which were also verified through experiments or physical measurements. Quite a few other discoveries took place around this time leading to an explosion in the scope of physics. Most of these influenced Einstein’s own research and thinking. A brief description follows.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962)</h2>
			<p>Niels Bohr established a new model for the structure of the atom in 1913. Six years younger than Einstein, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1922. A Dane by birth, he was attracted by the work of Planck, Einstein, J. J. Thomson and Ernst Rutherford.</p>

			<p>Bohr found that electrons circled round the nucleus of the atom in permitted orbits. By absorbing energy from radiation only in increments, they were pushed to a bigger permitted orbit. They could also emit radiation (hence energy) in increments and move to a smaller orbit. Einstein based some of his papers on Bohr’s ideas. Bohr opined that during emission and absorption the photons pulse out or pulse in, in all directions at once.</p>
			<p>There was a problem. There was no way to determine which way the photons would go. Further, there was no way to predict when it would happen. Thus, only the probability of a photon moving in a certain direction and the probability that a photon would be emitted at a certain moment could be calculated. Chance and probability entered the picture.</p>
			<p>Niels Bohr and his student Werner Heisenberg developed many aspects of Quantum Mechanics in Copenhagen between 1924 and 1927. Their findings form what is widely known as Copenhagen Interpretation, according to which, “a quantum particle doesn’t exist in one state or another, but in all of its possible states at once. It’s only when we observe its state that a quantum particle is essentially forced to choose one probability, and that’s the state that we observe.”</p>
			<p>It seemed that the Newtonian cause-effect rule was being violated. According to Newton, given the state at this moment one can calculate precisely what happens at the next moment. “Not so anymore!” exclaimed Niels Bohr. Einstein would not accept it. He found it strange that an electron exposed to radiation could decide when to jump off and where to jump off, of its own accord or free will. He wrote to Max Born, “If that be true, I would prefer to be a cobbler or even an employee of the gaming house than a physicist”.</p>
			<p>Einstein and Bohr were great friends. Einstein enjoyed Bohr’s company and Bohr revered Einstein. Bohr was particularly pleased that he was awarded the Nobel Prize after Einstein. He acknowledged that he was after all following Einstein who should have received the prize first.</p>
			<p>In 1923, after delivering his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at Stockholm, Einstein stopped in Copenhagen. Bohr met him at the train station. They boarded a tram to go to Bohr’s house. At once an animated discussion about Quantum Mechanics started. They failed to notice that their stop had passed. They caught a tram in the opposite direction and resumed their discussion. Again they went too far!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Louis de Broglie (1892 – 1987)</h2>
			<p>The next of the “Young Turks” who disturbed Einstein was Louis de Broglie. In his 1924 dissertation, he proclaimed thus: If a wave can behave like a particle, then a particle can behave like a wave. In other words, whatever Einstein had proposed with respect to light should also be true of other particles like electrons. The wave-particle dualism should be extended to all particles, electrons, protons and others. He was also able to explain Niels Bohr’s finding that electrons change their orbits only by Quantum Leaps. His thesis was approved by Einstein, but he suspected that if particles exhibited dualism then the double slit experiment should indicate interference fringes. Perhaps he believed it would not happen as he had a strong disbelief in Quantum Theory. But surprise was in store. Experiments justified the dualism of particles. Thus Einstein became the founder of Quantum Mechanics!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Satyendranath Bose (1894 – 1974)</h2>
			<p>A noteworthy scientist from India, Satyendranath Bose was a theoretical physicist from Calcutta. He had a wide range of interests in varied fields including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature and music. He served on many research and development committees in independent India. He came in contact with teachers such as Jagadish Chandra Bose and Prafulla Chandra Ray who inspired him to aim high in life. He rose to top ranks in the universities of Calcutta and Dhaka and became the Vice Chancellor of Visva Bharathi University in Shanthi Nikethan.</p>

			<p>Bose found that the commonly used Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution was not applicable to tiny particles such as electrons. He came up with his own method and wrote to Einstein, even though he did not know him in person.</p>
			<p>“Respected Sir, I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient 8π ν2/c3 in Planck’s Law independent of classical electrodynamics, only assuming that the ultimate elementary region in the phase-space has the content h3. I do not know sufficient German to translate the paper. If you think the paper worth publication I shall be grateful if you arrange for its publication in ZeitschriftfürPhysik. Though a complete stranger to you, I do not feel any hesitation in making such a request. Because we are all your pupils though profiting only by your teachings through your writings. I do not know whether you still remember that somebody from Calcutta asked your permission to translate your papers on Relativity in English. You acceded to the request. The book has since been published. I was the one who translated your paper on Generalised Relativity.”</p>
			<p>Einstein readily agreed and even translated Bose’s paper into German and had it published in ZeitschriftfürPhysik under Bose’s name, in 1924. Thus came into being the Bose-Einstein Statistics. It also led to the understanding of the phenomenon, Bose-Einstein Condensation. Einstein happily undertook this task and it did not disturb him later as did the work of some other friends.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Erwin Schrodinger (1887 – 1961)</h2>
			<p>Erwin Schrodinger was an Austrian theoretical physicist, and author of the science classic , What is Life? He was attracted by the work of de Broglie and developed what is now famous as Wave Mechanics and derived equations to explain the wave-like behaviour of electrons and named such waves, Einstein-de Broglie Waves. Einstein failed to comprehend what the equations really stood for in the real world. Schrodinger was deeply influenced by the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads and kept copies of them by his bed side.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Max Born (1882 – 1970)</h2>
			<p>Max Born, a teacher in Gottingen, Germany explained the real world implications of Schrodinger’s equations. He proposed that the wave equation does not predict the behaviour of the particle but gives the probability of its location at a given moment. Einstein was once again baffled.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976)</h2>
			<p>Werner Heisenberg was a student of both Niels Bohr and Max Born. He firmly believed that any acceptable concept should be observable or measurable. Thus, he questioned the very possibility of electron orbits. His contribution to Quantum Mechanics is the Uncertainty Principle, according to which it is impossible to determine the position and the velocity (or momentum) of a particle at the same instant. The very act of determining the velocity of a particle may alter its position, he explained. Actually it meant that an electron does not have a definite path or position until we observe it.</p>
			<p>This development of uncertainty seemed strange to Einstein who believed in Determinism. Given the information on the particle at this instant of time, we should be able to accurately determine what happens next. There is no room for probability, uncertainty or chance, the key words for Quantum Mechanics. But there seemed to be a Free Will allowing the particle to behave in a random manner. How was Einstein to understand this?</p>
			<p>Philosophically it raised a very important question. Is there an absolute truth? Or is the truth dependent on how we perceive it? Heisenberg readily believed that what we perceive is the truth. There is no absolute truth. Einstein would not accept it. It is puzzling that Einstein who said that there was no absolute space, and no absolute time, insisted that there was an absolute truth! This led some of the younger scientists to even ridicule him.</p>
			<p>An interesting dialogue transpired between Einstein and Heisenberg in this regard.</p>
			<p>Heisenberg: We cannot observe electrons inside atoms. A good theory must be based on observable facts.</p>
			<p>Einstein: Don’t you believe that only observable magnitudes must go into a theory?</p>
			<p>Heisenberg: Isn’t it what you have done with Relativity?</p>
			<p>Einstein commented when speaking to Philipp Frank, “A new fashion has come about in physics wherein certain things which cannot be observed should not be ascribed reality.”</p>
			<p>Frank shot back, “This fashion you speak of was invented by you in 1905!”</p>
			<p>In 1927, during the bicentenary of Newton’s death, Einstein tried to defend a mechanics based on the principles of causality and certainty. It was the same Einstein who, just twenty years before, had shaken the pillars that Newton had established.</p>
			<p>The question was open. Does determinism rule the world? Or is there a free will? Einstein and Niels Bohr discussed this issue for many years. This question is not limited to Quantum Mechanics but is also pertinent to science, knowledge and philosophy. One of Bohr’s students has said, “In all the history of human thought, there is no greater dialogue than that which took place over the years between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein about the meaning of quantum.” C P Snow says, “No more profound intellectual debate has ever been conducted.”</p>
			<p>Einstein would say, “God does not play dice with the world.” Niels Bohr would retort, “Stop telling God what to do.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Debate – Does God play dice with the world?</h2>
			<p>Quantum Mechanics, its validity and future became the hot topic of discussion in the Solvay Conferences of 1927 and 1930. The first of these was attended by Lorentz, Planck and Einstein on behalf of the opponents of the theory. On the other hand, there were a host of scientists to argue for the theory. These included Niels Bohr, Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Crompton, Erwin Schrodinger among others. Most of them were young, in their twenties. Einstein did not speak much in the open sessions, but he engaged in lively discussions with the youngsters during breakfast, lunch and dinner. He went from person to person to campaign against the theory. Discussions between Einstein and Bohr continued. Einstein suggested thought experiments to pull down Quantum Theory. The animosity reached such a level that Ehrenfest fumed, “Einstein, I am ashamed of you.”</p>
			<p>Einstein exhibited towards the Quantum Theory the same attitude of scepticism and opposition expressed towards the Theory of Relativity by his opponents. Clearly Einstein had lost the debate. He was nevertheless cordial with de Broglie and encouraged him in his endeavours. He even went to the extent of nominating Heisenberg and Schrodinger for the Nobel Prize which they rightly deserved and were awarded.</p>
