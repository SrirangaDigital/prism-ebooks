		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Einstein is fifty</h1>
		<p>Einstein turned fifty on March 29, 1929. He preferred to spend the day in seclusion and holidayed for a few days at a cottage that belonged to his doctor. Besides his family, nobody was aware of this retreat. A family feast did take place in the afternoon. Einstein appeared in his oldest suit! A paparazzo from New York Times, however, managed to locate him and steal an interview; the news item appeared with the headline, “Einstein found hiding on his birthday.”</p>
		<p>A number of presents including a microscope and greetings came in. Einstein marvelled at a few coins from an unemployed person asking him to buy tobacco and acknowledged the gift. A girl sent him a poem. Other gifts meant little to him.</p>
		<p>Though the Council of Berlin wanted to gift Einstein the right to live for life in a house near a lake, several issues prevented the Council from making the gift. The Council considered two other plots, but once again failed. Einstein decided to buy land on his own and selected a section in the village of Caputh (today, it is the capital of Brandenburg) about 6 km south of Potsdam. The Council now wanted to gift him 20,000 marks, but nationalists objected and wanted the issue to be discussed in detail in the Council meeting. Annoyed, Einstein declined the gift.</p>
		<p>Einstein went ahead and constructed a house at his own expense. It was a simple house with a large window, offering a nice view of River Havel. He reserved a room on the ground floor for himself. The room sported a large table and a portrait of Newton. Rooms for his wife and her daughters were on the top floor. His friends gifted him a thirty-three foot long boat – Tummler (Dolphin). He liked sailing though he did not swim. Whether he sailed or remained home, his scientific contemplation never stopped.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein and his family</h2>
			<p>With a house of his own and Elsa the woman he loved by his side, Einstein lived happily in Caputh. With Mileva he shared a love-hate relationship, which had improved after divorce. We have seen Einstein’s insensitive and indifferent treatment of Mileva. Not so after divorce. He bought her a gift from South America and when Mileva visited Berlin he invited her to stay with him and Elsa. Mileva, however, preferred to stay with the Habers.</p>
			<p>The German mark was losing its value day by day in those war-ravaged times. A mark would only fetch about two cents at one stage. So providing funds for the support of children and Mileva in Switzerland became difficult. Einstein asked them to move over to Germany. The fame that followed his General Theory improved his finances. He was paid handsome fees for his talks in universities in Europe. Einstein ensured that the money was directly sent to Ehrenfest in Holland where currency was more stable.</p>
			<p>Another person just as important as Elsa or Mileva who entered Einstein’s life was Helen Dukas who became his secretary in 1928 when Einstein was bedridden with an inflamed heart. Only after Elsa interviewed and appointed her, was she introduced to Einstein. Helen Dukas remained his trusted secretary till his death in 1955. She was never married. She kept journalists at bay and passed on to Einstein only relevant letters. Within a short span of time, she became aware of his likes and dislikes and understood him in a way no member of the family ever could.</p>
			<p>Einstein also acquired a calculator; well, not a machine, but a person, Walther Meyer from Vienna. A Jew by birth, he helped Einstein with his calculations with the unified theory he was developing and remained a constant companion.</p>
			<p>Einstein now shared a good relationship with his son Hans. The two exchanged letters. Hans’ letters were a mixture of love and hatred. Einstein showed interest in his studies and his plans for the future. Hans decided to become an engineer, hydraulic to be specific. He gained admission to ETH, the Alma Mater of his father.</p>
			<p>Hans fell in love with a girl called Frieda Knecht. She was nine years older than he, less than five feet tall, ordinary looking but smart. Einstein tried to prevent the marriage as his own parents had done when he married Mileva. History replayed! When it was clear that Hans would not budge, Einstein cautioned that the relationship would not last even one year. He went to the extent of advising them not to have children.</p>
			<p>The wedding took place and Hans proved his father wrong. They had children and remained together till 1957 when Frieda died. At Einstein’s suggestion, the couple also adopted a girl, Evelyn.</p>
			<p>Hans Albert Einstein, after passing out of ETH held various positions as an engineer. His wife and he migrated to USA following his father. Hans became a Professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and died on July 26, 1973. His children were Bernhard Caesar, Klaus Martin, Evelyn, and two boys who lived only a few days. Bernhard (1930–2008) was a physicist and engineer. Klaus lived only six years (1933 – 39). Evelyn (1941–2011) was an animal control and police officer.</p>
			<p>Eduard never recovered enough to lead a healthy life. He developed schizophrenia. He fancied being a poet or studying medicine to become a psychiatrist. It is interesting that Einstein met Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis and the two signed an anti-war plea. However, during their meeting, Einstein chose not to discuss his son’s illness. Interestingly enough, Eduard wanted to marry a lady who was older to him by ten years. Perhaps, some disposition in their genes! However, the marriage did not take place.</p>
			<p>Eduard’s health posed serious problems. His outbursts went out of control. At one point of time Mileva hired body guards to protect herself.</p>
			<p>Mileva presented herself, to everybody’s surprise, at Margot (Elsa’s daughter) and Dimitri Marianoff’s wedding in Berlin. Eduard had attempted suicide and she was there to seek Einstein’s help. But in vain as he was to leave for America shortly! He did not see his son at all after he developed schizophrenia.</p>
			<p>Mileva looked after Eduard till her death in 1948. Subsequently, Eduard died of a stroke in 1965, at the age of 55.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Did Einstein believe in God?</h2>
			<p>A good question to ask. Many great people in the world have been asked this question. They have given various answers.</p>
			<p>Einstein did not believe in the conventional idea of a God. He believed in Beauty and Simplicity. He sought beauty in an equation; simplicity in a theory. He looked for these two elements in all his works. He would often contemplate, “What was in God’s mind when he created this world (universe)?’ “If I were God, would I have created the world this way?” Who was his God then?</p>
			<p>Einstein appreciated the harmony and order that existed in the cosmos. But he could not relate this with the suffering of mankind. Expressing his personal understanding of a God, Einstein said, “I cannot think of a personal God who influences the actions of individuals.” He has also said, “I believe in Spinoza’s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings...” To a school girl he explained that every scientist is convinced that there is some spirit behind the laws of physics and the universe. This spirit is an eternal one and humbles us in every way. Therefore a scientific quest becomes a spiritual quest.</p>
			<p>At another time he averred, “I’m not an atheist and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangements of the books, but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravindranath Tagore and Einstein</h2>
			<p>Einstein met Ravindranath Tagore on July 14, 1930 at his home in Caputh and once again, sometime later. Tagore, a famous Bengali poet, author, playwright and novelist who also revolutionised music in India. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his work Gitanjali. Their conversation centred on causality, truth, beauty, religion, music among a host of other topics. Detailed transcripts of their conversations are available on the internet. But doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of these records, since, it is said that they could hardly communicate because, Tagore did not speak German and Einstein was not very good in English. Tagore’s observation of Einstein- “He is a solitary man.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Second visit to America</h2>
			<p>It was December 1930. After Margot’s wedding, Einstein and Elsa along with Walther Meyer set sail to America from Antwerp in Belgium; this was their second visit. Einstein’s invitation had come from the Nobel Laureate, Robert A Millikan, President of California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, in Los Angeles. Einstein was to spend a two month term as a research fellow. Millikan had experimentally verified Einstein’s equations on photoelectric effect and Brownian Motion. As a result, the institute had gained worldwide recognition, which it retains to this day.</p>

			<p>As usual there were requests for lectures and interviews. Einstein could not shun public appearances any more. He agreed for an interview with reporters on arrival in New York. The press asked questions on a wide range of topics, from his ideas about the fourth dimension to Adolf Hitler. About the fourth dimension he said, “A spiritualist will explain it better.” Could Relativity be explained in one sentence? “It takes me three days to give a short definition.” Regarding Hitler, he retorted, “He is living on the empty stomach of Germany.”</p>
			<p>Elsa also attracted the attention of the press and appeared on the cover of Time magazine. She was hailed as the lady who kept accounts and managed all of Einstein’s affairs, thus allowing him to focus on his research. She declared, “He is my life. I like being his wife very much.” She supported charities by charging one dollar for Einstein’s autograph and five for a picture with him.</p>
			<p>A surprise awaited Einstein when he visited the newly built Riverside Church in Manhattan. There stood a stone statue of Einstein amidst that of ten other thinkers. Startled, he asked,</p>
			<p>“Am I the only living one among all these people?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, professor,” said his host.</p>
			<p>“Then I will be careful about what I say and do from now onwards.”</p>
			<p>Einstein made good use of the mass hysteria that his mere presence ignited, to advocate his thoughts. He spoke to students at Caltech, addressed a rally at the train station in Chicago and the War Resister’s League in New York. He propagated antiwar ideas and advised people not to enrol for compulsory military training. After all military training teaches you to kill! Even if 2% of the population desisted from training, governments would become powerless, he declared. This declaration gained fame as the 2% comment.</p>
			<p>Einstein sailed to San Diego via Cuba where he was treated as a celebrity again. At San Diego a group of five hundred girls received him in a lavish four hour ceremony. The press was of course present. He visited California. Hollywood amused him. He even got an offer to act in a movie which he of course rejected. He toured the Universal Studios and lunched with Charlie Chaplin. A few days later, Einstein and Chaplin attended the premier of the movie The City Lights. They were greeted with applause. Charlie Chaplin commented, “They cheer me because they fully understand me; they cheer you because they do not understand you.”</p>
			<p>Einstein’s visit to the Mount Wilson Laboratory in California was important from a scientific point of view. During his work on cosmology (outlined later in the book), Einstein’s calculations had shown that our universe is unstable and contracting or expanding. He was not convinced with the outcome and had attributed it to an error of calculation. To stabilise the cosmos, he had introduced a cosmological constant. During this visit to the Mount Wilson Laboratory he learnt that there is evidence to prove that our universe is in fact expanding. His initial calculations were indeed correct and hence he withdrew the constant.</p>
			<p>When Einstein and Elsa were shown the highly advanced telescopes and what they were capable of, Elsa was least impressed. She dismissively remarked, “My husband can do all this on the back of an envelope.”</p>
			<p>As he crossed fifty, Einstein seemed to move away from science towards politics. During this tour he actively condemned war, nationalism and allied feelings. He was not just a pacifist; he was a militant pacifist, as he called himself. This sentiment was seen as anti-American by many and put the host Millikan in an awkward situation. He was successful in persuading rich philanthropists and industrialists to pump money into Caltech. Millikan was pressurised to prevent Einstein from making such statements. As a result, Millikan denounced the 2% comment of Einstein.</p>
			<p>On his way back home he checked into the Waldorf Hotel in New York. The couple were provided two separate suites and they could not locate each other! They solved the problem by locking up one of the suites. The Einsteins were seen off at the New York port by a big group of young pacifists who shouted, no war forever, as the ship set sail. He arrived in USA as a scientist and left as an anti-war hero!</p>
			<p>Thus, Einstein in his later years donned the role more of a social reformer than just of a scientist. Very few understood his Theory of Relativity yet it elevated his social and political status such that he could now make statements about war and peace and people would lend a keen ear.</p>
			<p>The League of Nations had been formed after the First World War in an attempt to prevent further warfare. Einstein followed its activities, but opined that it was a rather timid organisation, more so because he was himself in favour of aggressive attempts to end war and promote disarmament. But the organisation had only a limited agenda of arms control.</p>
			<p>Einstein was joined in his endeavour by Sigmund Freud (founding father of psychoanalysis), Upton Sinclair (famous American author) , H G Wells (famed writer of science fiction) and John Dewey (American philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer). Together they issued a memorandum and pleaded abolition of compulsory military training. There was some hope when a General Disarmament Conference co-organised by the League of Nations, USA and Russia was held in 1932 in Geneva. Einstein participated in the conference as a spectator in the visitors’ gallery. The only interesting event that occurred was that on sighting Einstein, the delegates stopped their deliberations and gave him a standing ovation!</p>
			<p>A section of the society declared Einstein a communist; he, in fact, was against any form of totalitarianism and was critical of the communist regime ravaging Russia. He sympathised with the Arabs who were being driven out of Israel. He reflected, “If we cannot cooperate with the Arabs, we have not learnt anything during 2000 years of suffering.” He even recommended setting up a joint committee of Arabs and Jews for a ceasefire.</p>
			<p>Einstein made a third trip to America in December 1931, again on an invitation by Millikan to spend two months in Caltech as a visiting professor. It seemed that spending the early part of every year in Caltech would become a permanent arrangement for Einstein. Oxford University was also contemplating on extending an invitation to him.</p>
			<p>He was stationed in rooms at the Athenaeum. A lady offered $10,000 to Caltech for a meeting with Einstein. Predictably Einstein refused! It was here that Abraham Flexner, an educator, met him over a long discussion. Flexner’s mission was to set up a centre where scholars could work freely without the pressures of teaching and administration. Flexner had received a 5 million dollar donation from Louis Bamberger who had sold a departmental store. The centre was to be named The Institute for Advanced Study and was to be located next to Princeton University in New Jersey. Einstein, Millikan and Flexner met and discussed over a long meeting. Obviously, Einstein would be a very appropriate person to head the institute. An invitation was extended; he was yet to give his consent.</p>
			<p>Did Einstein like America? Maybe he did not. He was quite disillusioned with life in America. When his friend Ehrenfest wanted to work in America and sought Einstein’s opinion, he said that life in Holland was much better. According to him there were only a few real scholars in America and life was boring. But he liked the independence and individuality that America promoted. But its materialism? No, not acceptable!</p>
			<p>The next meeting between Einstein and Flexner took place on the broad lawns of Christ Church’s Tom Quad of Oxford University while he was there on a lecture tour. A formal invitation was extended to him for an appointment at The Institute for Advanced Study. Details were sorted out in Einstein’s house in Caputh in June 1932. Among other things, his remuneration was discussed. Einstein requested $3,000 a year. Flexner was surprised that Einstein quoted such a small amount. Einstein thought he had asked an exorbitant amount. Immediately he wondered, “Could I live on less?” A sum of $15,000 was decided upon with Elsa’s intervention and other considerations. Walther Meyer was also to be appointed and paid by the Institute.</p>
			<p>The press was quick to act. The news that Einstein would move to Princeton made headlines. Randolf Frothingham, President, Woman Patriot Corporation, an influential organisation fighting pacifism, communism, socialism and other tendencies that were considered anti-American, wanted to prevent Einstein from entering America. She presented a 16 page memorandum to the US State Department describing Einstein as a pacifist and a communist.</p>
			<p>The government filed a petition and sent a copy to the US Consulate in Berlin, which was responsible for issuing Einstein the visa. The petition filed in America grew in size with time. Twenty three years later, it had become a dossier of 1427 pages.</p>
			<p>As Einstein was packing to leave Berlin for America (for a sojourn in Caltech), he received a call from the US Consulate in Berlin requesting him to attend an interview. Einstein rushed to Berlin from Caputh. The Deputy Consul conducted the interview which lasted more than 45 minutes. He wanted to ascertain Einstein’s political affiliations, to which he replied he had none.</p>
			<p>Then he was specifically asked:</p>
			<p>“What party do you belong to or sympathise with? For instance, are you a communist or an anarchist?”</p>
			<p>“What is this, an inquisition? Is this an attempt at chicanery? I don’t propose to answer such silly questions,” retaliated Einstein.</p>
			<p>He continued,</p>
			<p>“I didn’t ask to go to America. Your country men invited me, yes, begged me. If I am to enter your country as a suspect, I don’t want to go at all. If you don’t want to give me a visa, please say so. Then I will know where I stand.”</p>
			<p>Einstein grabbed his hat and coat and stormed out of the office saying,</p>
			<p>“Are you doing this to please yourselves or are you acting upon orders from above?”</p>
			<p>It was learnt later that Einstein refused to sign a declaration denying that he was a member of the Communist party. However, officials of the consulate conferred and Einstein was informed that night that a visa would be issued.</p>
			<p>Newspapers reported, “Einstein resumes packing.” He told reporters on many occasions in future that he was not a communist and that he did not favour communism in any way.</p>
