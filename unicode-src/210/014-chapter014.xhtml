		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">To America For Good</h1>
		<p>The ocean liner Westmoreland carried an important family on October 7, 1933 to New York. It started from Antwerp, where Elsa and Helen Dukas boarded, and stopped at Southampton in England to pick up Albert Einstein and Walther Meyer. It was a one way trip. They did not return to Europe. The ocean liner arrived in New York on October 17.</p>
		<p>Reporters waited to have a word with him and for a photo opportunity, but in vain. Flexner had tricked them all. He had arranged Einstein and others to disembark on to a small tug boat. They were whisked away in a waiting car straight to Princeton. Flexner had also forbidden Einstein from giving interviews and making statements.</p>
		<p>As soon as he landed, the first thing that Einstein did was to buy ice cream at a corner shop! Instead of his poor English, he used sign language to communicate. He pointed his thumb at a customer who had just bought it and then pointed it at himself. The sales girl must have felt it to be the greatest moment in her life.</p>
		<p>The Institute of Advanced Study was housed in Princeton University and had eighteen visiting scholars. John Von Neumann, a forerunner in the area of computer science in USA, was a resident at the Institute. Alan Turing, known for his pioneering work in computer design and encryptology in Britain joined a little later. Turing is known for his contribution to cracking the German code during the war. Whether Turing and Einstein communicated with each other is not known.</p>
		<p>While equipping his office, the one special item Einstein requested was a large waste paper basket. “I make many mistakes,” he remarked.</p>
		<p>His interest in music continued and he became acquainted with noted violinists Toscha Seidel and Fritz Kreisler. He regularly played with small groups of musicians. When school girls visited them, he entertained them by playing on his violin.</p>
		<p>His neighbours slowly grew accustomed to his eccentricities; he ignored ordinary things in life to concentrate on more important issues. His hair was unkempt; a tie, optional; and socks were not required. Age was on his side. He remarked jocularly, “One advantage of being old is that you do not have to wear socks when others ask you to.”</p>
		<p>Like Millikan at Caltech, Flexner at Princeton had to temper Einstein’s public utterances. Einstein was at the mercy of America and the Americans. None of his actions or words must displease them. Any pacifist statements, pro-Jewish utterings or anti-war sayings could land him in trouble. Once, a few boys from Einstein Science Club in a local school met him at his house. While talking to them, Einstein opined that there was no anti-Semitism in America. The teacher accompanying the students informed the local newspaper about it. The editor made it a headline.</p>
		<p>Flexner was infuriated. He requested and pleaded Elsa to ensure that Einstein made no such statements. To make matters worse, Einstein had agreed to perform in a music recital in Manhattan to raise money for Jewish refugees. Flexner tried to stop his performance. There was a feeling that giving too much publicity to Jews could provoke anti-Semitic feelings. Ignoring all warnings Einstein performed at the concert.</p>
		<p>Flexner took matters into his own hands now. He started intercepting Einstein’s mail. He replied to a few of them himself without Einstein’s knowledge. One such was an invitation from President Roosevelt. The president had invited Einstein and Elsa to visit him in the White House. Flexner sent a letter of apology that read thus: “Einstein is here to carry out some scientific work in seclusion and does not like him to be brought to public notice.” When he learnt of this, Einstein at once wrote to Roosevelt explaining the situation. In fact, Einstein was waiting to meet Roosevelt hoping it could help the Jewish cause in America. The president’s wife Eleanor herself made a telephone call to Elsa and extended an invitation. In January, 1934 Elsa and Einstein met the president in the White House and spent the night there.</p>
		<p>Einstein complained bitterly about Flexner’s censorship to an official; in the letter he mentioned his address as, Concentration Camp, Princeton! After this incident the relationship between Flexner and Einstein worsened.</p>
		<p>Ever since he left Germany he was haunted by the one very existential question: where to strike roots? In April, 1934 Einstein chose Princeton above Oxford, Caltech and Madrid as his abode for the rest of his life. The next logical step was to obtain an American citizenship. President Roosevelt had expressed his willingness to make a special provision to immediately naturalise Einstein and his family. But Einstein preferred the routine procedure.</p>
		<p>Elsa’s daughter Ilse was sick. She had been diagnosed with leukaemia and her condition was critical. She had moved in with her sister Margot who lived in Paris. Elsa rushed to Paris; Einstein stayed back. Ilse died on June 10, 1934. A devastated Elsa left Paris with a small quantity of Ilse’s ash packed in a bag. Elsa collected Einstein’s papers from the French Consulate which Margot had handed over when the Nazis had ransacked his house in Caputh.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">112 Mercer Street</h2>
			<p>In the summer of 1936 Einstein moved to a modest wooden house at 112, Mercer Street and remained there till his death. Displaying no extraordinary architectural features, the house accommodated a living room with German furniture at the ground level, and a library and study at the second. A large desk, like the one in Berlin, big bookcases and an easy chair formed Einstein’s furniture in the study. As before, portraits of Maxwell, Faraday and Newton decorated the walls. A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi whom Einstein revered was an addition. A dog, a cat and a parrot completed the family.</p>
			<p>Einstein did not drive. He walked to his office. The neighbours found this interesting. Walter Isaacson gives a very detailed account of Einstein’s routine.</p>
			<p>In the morning after a bubble bath came a big breakfast with at least two eggs. He would then walk to the institute. He would stand in front of a blackboard with his assistant, Meyer or Leopold Infeld and start writing equations. He preferred German speaking assistants as his communication skills in English were limited. One of his students joked that he had an English vocabulary of 300 words. One of his favourite expressions was, 'I will a little tink'.</p>
			<p>At midday, Einstein would walk home with a few colleagues, discussing, arguing about some scientific issue or the other. When they reached 112, Mercer Street, his companions would drift away in the direction of their houses. Einstein would stand in front of his house for a while. Sometimes, he would simply go back to work! If Helen Dukas was watching from the house, she would come out and drag Einstein inside and force him to eat lunch, usually macaroni. He would then respond to his mail and work on problems of interest. He used to receive a large number of fan mail.</p>
			<p>Several amusing anecdotes connected with Einstein are available; many of which may even be fictitious.</p>
			<p>He walked a lot in Princeton but was absent minded. Once, the dean’s secretary received a call. The dean was not available. The caller asked the secretary for Einstein’s address. The secretary informed that policy did not permit her to give out addresses to strangers. Then to the secretary’s surprise, the caller whispered, “I am Einstein. Don’t tell anyone. I have forgotten my address!”</p>

			<p>Walter Isaacson in his biography of Einstein refers to an incident at a dinner party hosted in honour of Einstein. After the preliminary introductions, it was Einstein’s turn to speak. There was a thunderous applause. Scribbling some equations on a piece of paper, he did not seem to take note of the proceedings. Helen Dukas nudged him to get up. He did and still did not realise that he had to deliver his speech. Seeming quite lost, he too started clapping!</p>
			<p>Einstein is known to have written many letters of support to Germans who wanted to migrate to America. He offered them financial help and wrote certificates and testimonials when requested. In this regard, Infeld has jested, “Everyone has a certificate from Einstein!”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein and School children</h2>
			<p>Einstein interacted with school children many a time. Once, an eight year old girl approached Einstein in his house and asked for help in arithmetic. She had brought some fudge as fees for the lesson! Einstein helped her out and offered some cookies. When the incident came to light, the girl's parents apologised to him. In all humility he replied, “I have learnt as much from her as she has learnt from me!”</p>
			<p>Two other girls were treated with a lunch of baked beans when they came to him for help in math. Einstein consoled a little girl who complained that mathematics was a ‘big problem’ for her with the words, “Don’t worry; my problems are greater than yours.”</p>
			<p>Recorded is also an interesting incident about Henry Rosso, a 15 year old boy, from the Princeton High School. A student of journalism, his teacher had challenged him that an interview with Einstein would fetch him an A Grade. Henry accepted the challenge.</p>
			<p>With the milkman’s help Henry learnt the time Einstein would leave home for work and succeeded in tracking him. Surprisingly, Einstein agreed to give an interview. But to his dismay, Henry did not know what questions to ask. Einstein himself suggested questions related to mathematics and answered them! The interview, it was made clear, was for the purpose of the assignment only. Yet, somehow the press laid hands on it.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Elsa dies</h2>
			<p>Einstein lost Elsa in the year 1936. She was bedridden with kidney and heart ailments. A change of place was deemed necessary for her to recoup. Accordingly, Einstein and Elsa moved to a cottage at Saranac Lake near New York, but her health further deteriorated and she died on December 30, 1936. No mathematics or physics could help him; Einstein wept once again. Following Elsa’s death he returned to work with his face ashen. He found it difficult to concentrate.</p>
			<p>Maja now moved in with Einstein. Hans Albert arrived in Princeton and found work soon enough. After changing a few positions, he became a professor at the University of California in Berkeley. Eduard had to remain in Europe due to health concerns. Mileva found it increasingly difficult to take care of him. She sought the help of her sister Zorka, who was an alcoholic herself. All that Zorka managed to do before her death was to literally burn all the family money which Mileva had hidden in the oven!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">EPR Paradox</h2>
			<p>Einstein was involved in another controversy connected with quantum mechanics. It was found that under certain circumstances pairs of particles with the same quantum state could emerge. The surprising feature is that the two particles need not be physically proximate; they may even be a universe apart. Obviously, Einstein not very convinced of this phenomenon called it Spooky Action at a Distance. With the help of his assistants Podolsky and Rosen, he published a paper called the EPR Paper and ridiculed quantum mechanics.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s argument seemed realistic to many. But Wolfgang Pauli and Heisenberg were annoyed; so was Niels Bohr. Bohr gave it a serious thought and wrote a rebuttal which was longer than Einstein’s paper and showed where he had gone wrong. Schrodinger, a scientist was on Einstein’s side; he even congratulated Einstein on the EPR paper. He called this spooky action, Entanglement (Verschränkung).</p>
			<p>Einstein had clearly lost the battle. The EPR debate did not end with him. Experiments and observations continued and have proved the validity of entanglement and consequences of the Copenhagen Interpretation. Considerable research is in progress even today to apply these concepts to everyday life. High-end research is being conducted in the areas of quantum information theory, superdense coding, quantum teleportation, quantum computing, quantum crystallography and quantum cryptography.</p>
