		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">The Bomb Story</h1>
		<p>E = mc<sup>2</sup> was a discovery in fundamental physics exploring the relationship between mass and energy. Little had Einstein fathomed the possible consequences of his discovery. A young man in Prague had already hinted at one phenomenal extension of the theory, which he had completely dismissed.</p>

		<p>Niels Bohr visited Princeton with the news that scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman in Berlin had discovered a process to split an atom into two to release energy, which later came to be called nuclear fission. After Niels Bohr gave a talk in Princeton about this discovery, it led to a lot of related research in USA. Even at this juncture Einstein did not pay much attention.</p>
		<p>However, he was drawn into this area of work very soon and the person responsible was Leo Szilard, a physicist from Budapest, whom Einstein knew from his Berlin days. Szilard had since made his way to New York and was now engaged in research to create a chain reaction, at Columbia University. Having discovered uranium to be a suitable element, Szilard shared this knowledge with Eugene Wigner, another physicist from Budapest. They conjectured that the Germans may attempt to build a bomb using the chain reaction phenomenon, and that they might source uranium from the Belgian Congo through Belgium. Congo housed the world’s largest deposits of uranium. So, they concluded that it was imperative to alert Belgium about this possible misuse of uranium. They decided that Einstein, who shared cordial relations with the Belgian royal family, could warn them. The Queen with whom he had played violin a while ago was the Queen Mother now.</p>
		<p>The two raced to meet Einstein in 1939. But he was on a holiday sailing at Nassau Point near the village of Peconic Long Island. A young boy helped them locate Einstein. They explained their mission to Einstein. He understood the implications in a matter of fifteen minutes and agreed to write to a Belgian minister, with whom he was acquainted. Wigner felt that this may not be a wise move, considering that all three of them were refugees and any attempt to communicate with a foreign country might be misunderstood. They decided that Einstein should write to the Belgian ambassador in America, and intimate the same to the State Department. A letter was drafted. An official in the White House who was to deliver that letter to the State Department suggested that Einstein write to the president himself.</p>
		<p>Einstein wrote a revised letter to the President of the United States of America which read –</p>
		<p class="text-right">
			<strong>Albert Einstein</strong><br />
			Old Grove Rd., Nassau Point<br />
			Peconic, Long Island<br />
			August 2nd 1939
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>F.D. Roosevelt</strong><br />
			President of the United States<br />
			White House, Washington, D.C.
		</p>
		<p><em>Sir,</em></p>
		<p><em>Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been ommunicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:</em></p>
		<p><em>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America - that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</em></p>
		<p><em>This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable - though much less certain - that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</em></p>
		<p><em>The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia. While the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo. In view of the situation you may think it desirable to have more permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an unofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:</em></p>
		<p><em>a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States;</em></p>
		<p><em>b) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment. </em></p>
		<p><em>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.</em></p>

			<em> Yours very truly,</em><br />

		<p>The letter was sent through Alexander Sachs, an economist, who was well-known to the president. It took almost two months for him to meet the president. Realising its importance he preferred to read out the letter to the president who at once understood the implications. Nazis might blow up America, he thought.</p>
		<p>An ad hoc committee was formed. Einstein was not involved; neither did he want to be. However, Szilard and Wigner were on the committee. Einstein received a reply from the president informing him that a board had been formed. A sum of $6000 was allotted for the project which however moved at snail’s pace. On Szilard’s request, Einstein wrote to the president appraising him the urgency of the matter. The Germans might succeed first. President Roosevelt called for a meeting immediately and urged that the project be hastened. It is not clear whether Einstein was invited, but he did not want to attend.</p>
		<p>By May 1940, the war was in full progress. Germans had captured Holland and Belgium and France had surrendered. Britain stood alone. Then Germany invaded Russia.</p>
		<p>These developments made way for the well-known Manhattan project. Ironically, Einstein could not be a part of it. The Chief of Staff of the project, Brigadier Miles wanted a security clearance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) before allowing Einstein to play an active role. The FBI went through all the records they had about Einstein including the petition that had been filed by Mrs. Frothingham, that he be not given a visa to enter America. The records declared him a communist and a pro-Soviet. Einstein thus was considered a security risk, not to be trusted as a loyal citizen!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein a Citizen of America</h2>
			<p>It is interesting that in the middle of all this activity Einstein wrote a citizenship test in June 1940 and earned the eligibility to become a citizen of America. The ceremony itself took place in October when Einstein, Margot and Helen Dukas became naturalised citizens.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Manhattan Project</h2>
			<p>The Manhattan Project was launched on December 6, 1941. The very next day Japan bombed Pearl Harbour. Many people Einstein was closely associated with, including Szilard, Wigner, Oppenheimer and Teller, worked on this project. Einstein did not have firsthand knowledge of the progress of the project. However he was consulted on a few technical matters such as the separation of isotopes, the manner of placing mines in harbours etc. He was paid $25 a day for his services.</p>
			<p>Though he did not participate in the Manhattan Project, Einstein did contribute substantially to the war efforts. He auctioned the manuscript of the Special Relativity paper. Since the original was not available, Einstein dictated it to Helen Dukas who typed it out. This paper and another unpublished paper together fetched a total of $11.5 million dollars, which he donated to the War Bond drive.</p>
			<p>As the project progressed, it became clear to the participating scientists that the weapon they were creating was deadly and would change the nature of future warfare. One such scientist, Otto Stern met Einstein and sounded caution. On this occasion, Einstein decided to write to Niels Bohr.</p>
			<p>The gist of the letter that Einstein wrote to Niels Bohr was that the scientists should pressurise political leaders to bring about an internationalisation of power.</p>
			<p>Bohr had made a substantial contribution to the Manhattan Project. He had shown with his Liquid Drop theory that only one particular form of uranium could be split by bombarding it with a neutron. This was experimentally verified. Further Lise Meitner and others had computed the amount of uranium needed to cause an explosion. All this knowledge was made available to the Manhattan project. It appeared that the bomb would have been made whether Einstein wrote that letter to the president or not. In fact, the bomb, essentially a product of nuclear physics, would have been made even without the formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>

			<p>In March, 1945 the war was in the final stages. Szilard was in Princeton again to meet Einstein. He posed a big question. Germany was near defeat and had not progressed in making a bomb. If America succeeds in making one, who will be the victim? Japan? The very thought was dreadful.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Another Letter to Roosevelt</h2>
			<p>The meeting with Szilard prompted Einstein to write another letter to President Roosevelt. He stressed the need for communication between scientists and policy makers at this stage. He urged Roosevelt to speak to Szilard and other scientists.</p>
			<p>The letter did reach Roosevelt but he did not read it. According to a French movie on Einstein, Roosevelt told his secretary that he would read the letter tomorrow. But the tomorrow never came. Roosevelt was dead the same night. The letter was shown to Harry Truman, the next president who merely passed it on to the Secretary of State James Byrnes who was not impressed by the letter.</p>
			<p>Rest is history. The bomb was made and dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Three days later, it was Nagasaki’s turn. When Einstein heard the news, he cried in despair, “Oh, my God!”</p>
			<p>Once again Einstein was on the covers of magazines and front pages of newspapers. “The Man who Started It All”, proclaimed one newspaper. Einstein for his part could only lament. “If only I knew that Germans were not at it, I would not have written to the president,” he regretted. It was an added grief for him. He admired the Japanese greatly, and only a few years earlier, he had enjoyed their hospitality. Now it was as if he was responsible for the misery that the bomb had caused.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Thus sp0ke Krishna</h2>
			<p>America tested the bomb in a desert in New Mexico before dropping it on Japan. J Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist well known to Einstein was the head of the project. Watching the bomb explode he exclaimed and thought of Krishna’s words in the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
			<p class="verse">
				<strong>दिवि सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्  युगपदुत्थिता ।</strong>
				<strong>यदि भाः सदृशी सा स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मनः ।।</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="verse">
				Divi soorya sahasrasya bhaved yugapadutthitaa<br />
				Yadi bhaah sadrishee saa syaad bhaasastasya mahaatmanah (11.12)
			</p>
			<p>If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky, that would be like the splendour of that Mighty One.(The Cosmic or the Universal Form).</p>
			<p>The splendour of the Cosmic Form excels all others; it is indeed beyond comparison.</p>
			<p>Einstein in a meeting with Oppenheimer criticised the bomb-building exercise as a weapon of mass murder. Oppenheimer quoted Krishna from Bhagavad Gita --</p>
			<p class="verse">
				<strong>श्रीभगवानुवाच--</strong><br />
				<strong>कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो</strong><br />
				<strong>लोकान् समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः ।</strong><br />
				<strong>ॠतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे</strong><br />
				<strong>येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनिकेषु योधाः ।।</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="verse">
				Sri bhagavanuvaacha<br />
				kaalo’smi lokakshayakritpravriddho<br />
				lokaan samaahartumiha pravrittah<br />
				ritepi twaam na bhavishyanti sarve<br />
				ye’wasthitaah pratyaneekeshu yodhaah (11.32)<br />
				Sri Bhagavan said
			</p>
			<p>I am the mighty world-destroying Time now engaged in subduing the world. Even without you, none of the warriors arrayed in the opposite armies shall live.</p>
			<p>This is often quoted in books in the form - “I become death, the destroyer of worlds”. Evidently, Oppenheimer took shelter under Krishna who makes the world and also breaks it.</p>
