		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">What Next?</h1>
		<p>Einstein found himself in a very difficult situation. After the fame and glory of having achieved a breakthrough in physics, he was now extremely perturbed for being wrongfully held responsible for the construction of the bomb. Extremely repentant for the way things had shaped up, Einstein felt it was time to act. Observing the enormity of the damage the bomb had caused in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he concluded, very rightly, that if there would be a third world war it would be fought with atomic weapons and the fourth with stone!</p>
		<p>Einstein formulated grand political and social ideas just like he did in physics. He proposed the idea of a World Government; a super power, above all individual governments, to regulate building and possession of weaponry. He rationalised that if America, Britain and Russia would join hands, other like-minded countries would soon follow. He opined that America should reveal the bomb secret to this consortium of countries, which would result in no single country possessing the knowledge and thus break the monopoly over it.</p>
		<p>Grand, indeed. Perhaps Einstein was not politically shrewd enough to understand the impracticality of his idea. Soon enough he also realized that it was almost impossible to enter into any agreement with Russia. On the one hand he was trying to unify the forces in nature and on the other unify the countries of the world.</p>
		<p>During a dinner to commemorate Nobel, Einstein perceived a similarity between himself and Nobel. He was indirectly responsible for the bomb, which caused large-scale destruction and was now advocating peace. Nobel ironically had made lots of money building the dynamite and then awarded Nobel peace prizes.</p>
		<p>The Emergency Committee for Atomic Scientists was formed with Einstein as Chairman and Szilard as Director. The committee proposed a two-pronged agenda – formulation of a World Government and Arms Control. Einstein allowed his name to be used freely for he was aware that it worked in attracting influential people and donations.</p>
		<p>USA and Britain participated in arms control; but Russia did not. A cold war ensued between the West and Russia rendering any understanding impossible. But Einstein continued to insist that Moscow should somehow be involved in these ventures.</p>
		<p>Einstein was critical of the hysteria about communism and Russia that was fast rising in USA. He deemed it very dangerous. He openly opposed the anti-Red fever and felt that America was trying to curtail freedom of expression. Any statement opposing this view was treated as anti-American even though the constitution allowed for free speech. Rather than live in such a country as a scientist or a teacher, Einstein felt that he should have been a plumber who could freely express his views. The result was that the Plumbers Association admitted him as a member and sent him a membership card!</p>
		<p>In reality, Einstein was against the authoritarian rule of the communists in Russia. He refused invitations from Russia and condemned Russia’s misuse of veto power in the Security Council. But there were attempts in America to brand him a Soviet supporter. A congressman went to the extent of saying that Einstein misused his stature of a Nobel-winning scientist to promote communism.</p>
		<p>Einstein, at times, seemed to behave in a contradictory manner. A movement in America urging scientists to stop research work on building atomic weapons had started. Einstein surprisingly did not support the movement stating that until Russia obliged to disarmament, there was no point in America doing so.</p>
		<p>President Truman initiated a program to build the Hydrogen Bomb, which Einstein did not fully endorse. He made a television appearance expressing concern over the Government’s increased security measures which compromised the rights of people. Around this time Klaus Fuchs, a German scientist was identified as a Soviet spy and arrested. Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed in his famous speech that he possessed a list of card carrying communists working in the State Department. Thus began the Era of McCarthy or McCarthyism that lasted about five years. The hysteria against communism was further fanned. Suspicion and false accusation became the order of the day. Careers were ruined, arrests were made and people committed suicide. An estimated ten thousand people lost jobs on the grounds that they did not cooperate with the anti-communist movement.</p>
		<p>Against this background, Einstein had denounced the making of the H-bomb. Papers announced, “Disarm or die, says Einstein.” Einstein’s position on the H-bomb issue angered Eleanor Roosevelt (wife of former U.S President Roosevelt) and former U.S President Hoover. They ordered an FBI report about Einstein’s communist connections. The report listed thirty four organisations with which Einstein apparently had connections but concluded that he was no security risk. Interestingly, the FBI had been gathering information about Einstein ever since he joined Caltech in 1932. The result was a whopping 1427 pages stored in fourteen boxes!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Communication with Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
			<p>Einstein sought international support for the establishment of a Jewish state, which later became Israel. Among others, he wrote to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India. Einstein sent him a four page letter on June 13, 1947. India became independent two months later and Nehru had already been nominated prime minister. The letter praised India for its progressive thinking and abolition of untouchability, and requested Nehru’s support. However, India’s sympathies were with the Arabs. India opined that Palestine belonged to the Arabs and the Jews were trying to take it over. Accordingly, Nehru wrote a reply explaining India’s stand. It is not known whether Einstein replied at all.</p>

			<p>However, Nehru paid a personal visit to Princeton to meet Einstein on November 5, 1949. Indira Gandhi (Nehru’s daughter who later became India’s Prime Minister) and Vijayalakshmi Pandit (Nehru’s sister; Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union and President of the General Assembly of the UNO) were also present.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">He is a Communist!</h2>
			<p>Einstein supported only justice and not any particular political party or principle. The Rosenberg affair was one such issue that prompted Einstein to take a stand. American citizens of Jewish descent, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were arrested in 1950 on the charge of passing atomic secrets to Russia. Ethel’s own brother, to save his skin, had given statements against the couple. However, in 2001 he confessed to have lied.</p>
			<p>In 1951, the couple were sentenced to death. As the day of execution approached, demonstrations were held all over the world including Paris, Rome, London, Moscow, Prague, Warsaw, New York, Washington and Toronto. Noteworthy people such as Picasso, Sartre and even Pope Pius XII supported the protests. Einstein on his part wrote a letter, condemning the verdict to the judge, Irving Kaufman, who did nothing but hand it over to the FBI. The letter was only filed in the FBI dossier. Einstein wrote directly to President Truman himself. Since Truman was stepping down from office, the letter ended up with the next President, Eisenhower. He would not yield; the Rosenbergs were executed.</p>
			<p>Americans were enraged with Einstein’s active intervention and wrote angry letters in the press – “You have put the Jews first and then America”, “Go to Russia or where you came from”, “You need some common sense”.</p>
			<p>About the same time, Stalin in Russia had put on trial nine Jewish doctors for allegedly plotting to kill some leaders. Einstein joined hands with other scientists and sent a petition to Stalin asking the release of the doctors. They were freed, but only after Stalin’s death.</p>
			<p>The other person whom Einstein helped was Albert Shadowitz, a professor of physics who had been a member of the communist party and helped a union which was later banned because it included communist members. Shadowitz sought protection under the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution. He requested Einstein’s help. Einstein supported the cause and allowed Shadowitz to use his name freely. Another case involved the African-American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois. On the first day of the hearing, it was announced that Einstein would give evidence in favour of the scholar. The judge dismissed the case!</p>
			<p>Even Oppenheimer, Head of the Manhattan Project and Director of the Institute of Advanced Learning was not spared. He had made enemies for denouncing the H bomb. Besides, his wife and his brother were once members of the communist party. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) contemplated stripping him off his security clearance. Oppenheimer was prepared to face the commission and answer its questions. Einstein felt that Oppenheimer should not have undergone such humiliation. AEC decided that he was a security risk and he lost his security clearance a day before it would have naturally expired!</p>
			<p>The next logical question was whether Oppenheimer should be allowed to continue as the Director of the Institute of Advanced Learning. Einstein and others strongly supported his retention as Director. Oppenheimer saved his position.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Gandhiji’s Passive Resistance</h2>
			<p>Einstein had the greatest respect for Mahatma Gandhi. He was visibly moved when the latter was assassinated on January 30, 1948. He lamented, “Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.”</p>
			<p>Where there is injustice, Einstein decreed, people should not cooperate. If one is called to give a statement or evidence in support of a biased government, he urged, “Do not cooperate”. He preached Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of passive resistance and recommended non-cooperation to William Fruenglass, a teacher who had to testify before a Senate Committee examining the communist influence in high schools.</p>
			<p>There was uproar in the press. “How disgraceful you look without a haircut and a Russian wool cap”, “You are a menace to the country”, “You escaped from a communist country to have freedom, don’t abuse it.”</p>
			<p>Senator McCarthy was quick to react. “Any one advocating noncooperation in such matters is an enemy of America”, he declared. Bertrand Russell fully endorsed Einstein’s advice in a letter. Flexner who had retired by then also supported Einstein.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Oppenheimer’s enemies, Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the AEC and Edward Teller, with whom he had had a row over the development of the H bomb, were put to shame. McCarthy began to lose his popularity and in 1954 he met his own disgrace brought about by President Eisenhower, the U.S. Army and others, who eventually denounced his anti-communist propaganda. However, Einstein had preserved his integrity and his freedom of speech. There is always a difference between a politician making a lot of noise and a humanist fighting for a legitimate cause.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Would he go back to Germany?</h2>
			<p>Einstein was particularly happy when the Lincoln University, a black institution, conferred upon him an honorary degree. He had detested the prevalent racial discrimination in America. He again expressed his disapproval of capitalism. He felt that it made people selfish; encouraged students to study courses to make money; and discouraged creativity. He envisioned a planned economy which guaranteed universal employment and a home for the citizens of the country.</p>
			<p>After the war in 1946, Einstein was invited to re-join the Bavarian Academy, which he refused, saying, “The Germans have slaughtered my Jewish brothers; I will have nothing to do with them.” In 1949, he was called to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (now called the Planck Institute). He again refused. In 1951, he was asked to join the peace section of a Prussian organisation. He wrote, “Because of the mass murder that Germans inflicted upon the Jews, it is evident that a self-respecting Jew could not possibly be associated in any way with any official German institution.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Politics is for the present; equations are for eternity</h2>
			<p>Einstein retired from the Institute of Advanced Study when he turned sixty-six. Nevertheless, like most retirees from the universities, he retained a small office and went there almost every day. Though now a political figure, he still worked with his equations to unify the forces in nature, for according to him, “Politics is for the present; equations are for eternity.”</p>
			<p>During this period he enjoyed the company of many well-known scientists. One among them was the Director of the Institute, Oppenheimer. Another important visitor was Kurt Gödel, a mathematician from Vienna known for his Incompleteness Theory. He was also a migrant in America like Einstein and showed interest in concepts such as Time Travel and Relativity. The two became very good friends.</p>
			<p>Einstein’s main interest at this stage in life was focused on the unification of forces. He believed that gravity and electromagnetic forces could be explained by the same set of equations. He collaborated with Wolfgang Pauli in this pursuit for some time. A solution still eluded him. In 1949, a new edition of The Meaning of Relativity was published, which included an appendix detailing his latest work on unification.</p>
			<p>The media jumped with joy hoping for a breakthrough. The New York Times proclaimed, “New Einstein Theory Gives Master Key to The Universe”. Einstein learnt within six weeks that he was wrong. In 1951 he declared, “The unified theory has been put to retirement.”</p>
			<p>One surprising fact is that even at this stage Einstein did not accept quantum mechanics completely. He would say, “I may be wrong but I have earned a right to make mistakes.” At the same time he ridiculed quantum mechanics saying, “Does the observation by a mouse change the state of the universe?”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Tobacco Stealer</h2>
			<p>A very interesting incident happened when Niels Bohr visited Princeton. He was writing a paper which involved Einstein’s research. Bohr at one stage found it hard to continue. At such moments he would repeat words till he found a clue. Now Bohr, saying, “Einstein, Einstein … “, kept roaming about the room. He also called a colleague for help. The two were in the room when Einstein (his office was on the floor above) came in. His mission was to steal some tobacco as he was not allowed to buy it (by his wife and doctor). When suddenly Bohr turned around, all three were surprised. Laughter broke out.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Mileva Dies</h2>
			<p>Mileva’s health deteriorated, so did her financial situation. Eduard’s illness was a black hole that sucked all her money. The funds deposited from the Nobel Prize money had diminished in value due to inflation. She had sold two of her apartments. In 1948, Einstein succeeded in selling the third, the proceeds of which went directly to her.</p>
			<p>One wintery day Mileva slipped and fell while she was walking on the road. This fall turned out to be a prelude to her death three months later. Frieda, Einstein’s daughter-in-law found a sum of 85,000 Swiss francs, proceeds from the sale of the third apartment, under the mattress in Mileva’s apartment. Mileva had saved this money for Eduard’s treatment. Freida also found a bundle of letters, apparently correspondence between Einstein and Mileva.</p>
			<p>Eduard, Einstein’s second son from Mileva, was left alone in Zurich now. Einstein promised to take care of him at any cost.</p>
			<p>Einstein himself did not enjoy good health now. In 1948, an aneurysm in his aorta was diagnosed. As is true even today, rupture of an aneurysm is fatal. Of course, there are procedures today to prevent its rupture. But way back in 1948 there were none, which meant, death could knock on Einstein’s door anytime!</p>
			<p>Maja, separated from her husband was living with Einstein now. She suffered a stroke in 1948 and was bedridden. The only way Einstein could comfort her was by reading to her. Maja died in 1951. Now it was left to Margot to take care of Einstein.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Presidency of Israel</h2>
			<p>Though Einstein supported several cultural and political aspects associated with Israel, he had disliked some of the events that had unfolded there. He could not understand the violent military methods adopted by leaders such as Menachem Begin. He would have liked a more friendly approach on the part of the Israel government.</p>
			<p>Israel’s first President Chaim Weizmann died in 1952. Incidentally, it was he who had compelled Einstein to make his first trip to America to garner funds for the Jews. Thereafter, there was intense public pressure to elect Einstein as the next president of Israel. The Prime Minister Ben-Gurion agreed to approach Einstein. The newspapers had another heyday. The government of Israel appointed Abba Eban, the Ambassador of Israel in Washington to approach Einstein with an invitation. Einstein tried to make a phone call to the ambassador to reject the offer. But formalities required that the ambassador meet Einstein and officially invite him. An official from the embassy did meet Einstein in Princeton. But even before the invitation was handed to him, the rejection letter had been placed on the table!</p>
			<p>The invitation indicated that Einstein would be free to follow his scientific pursuits when he became the president. In other words, it was an invitation to be a figure head.</p>
