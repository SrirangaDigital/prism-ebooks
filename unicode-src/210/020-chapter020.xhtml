			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Photoelectric Effect</h2>
			<p>The Photoelectric effect, discovered by Hertz in 1887, refers to the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces when light shines on them. To better understand Einstein’s contribution to this phenomenon, let us look at how the theory evolved. It all started with Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) who gave us the theory of optics and showed that white light is composed of seven colours. He proposed the Particle Theory of Light or the Corpuscular Theory of Light which states that light is made up of particles. This is typically a mechanical view of the universe. Christiaan Huygens (1629 – 1695) proposed that light is made of waves. Thomas Young (1773 – 1829) conducted the famous experiment in which light was passed through a narrow slit. An interference pattern was observed supporting the wave theory of light. James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) a Scottish physicist pioneered the unification of electricity, magnetism and optics in his Electro Magnetic Theory. He proposed that these three seemingly unrelated fields were in fact manifestations of the same phenomenon – the Electromagnetic Field. This theory influenced Einstein to a considerable extent and supported the wave theory of light. Coincidentally, Einstein was born the same year that Maxwell died.</p>
			<p>In 1900, Max Planck (1858 – 1947) made a very important observation. He was studying the relationship between the intensity and frequency of radiation from a black body, and the temperature of the body. A black body is an object that is a perfect absorber of radiation. He found that energy radiated in chunks or packets. To be more specific, energy is a multiple of a constant, the actual formula being, E=hn<sup>2</sup>, where n is the frequency. Planck found the value of h to be 6.626x10 <sup>-34</sup> Joules seconds. Plank however did not realise the importance of his work. For him h was only a mathematical factor to complement his experimental observations. But later it became an important concept in physics and came to be known as Planck’s Constant.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>It was up to Einstein to synthesise all this information and make a bold hypothesis. Einstein reasoned that if energy comes in small packets called quanta, then the same should also be true of light. Here again energy is represented by h multiplied by frequency. Light therefore should consist of small particles or photons. Planck’s observations relating to black body radiation, should also be true for the photoelectric effect.</p>
			<p>Frequency of light became an important parameter. If photons have high frequency, energy released is also high; if the frequency is low, energy released is low. How about intensity of light? What role does it play? The more the intensity, the more the number of electrons knocked out of the surface of the metal. Greater intensity does not mean that electrons travel faster.</p>
			<p>Einstein had thus not just explained photoelectric effect; he had also made a contribution to the theory of light. Is it a particle? Or is it a wave? Clearly light exhibited a dual character. It was both a particle and a wave.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Determination of Size of Molecules</h2>
			<p>Einstein’s work on the size of molecules has a bearing on Amedeo Avogadro’s (1776-1856)hypothesis that states, “Equal volumes of samples of ideal gases at the same pressure and temperature have the same number of molecules.” The estimate for this number, called the Avogadro number is 6.02214x10 23.</p>
			<p>Einstein extended this hypothesis to liquids. He considered sugar solution and worked through its viscosity. He came up with two equations, one for the size of sugar molecules and the other for their number in water. He calculated a value of 2.1x10 23 for the Avogadro number, obviously too small. A few years later, one of Einstein’s students traced the cause of error and obtained a fairly correct value of 6.56x10 23. This research did make him Dr. Einstein and has found practical application in areas such as cement mixing and dairy production.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Brownian Motion</h2>
			<p>In 1828, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown observed the zigzag motion of pollen grains in water. The answer to why and how the particles took to zigzag motion in a liquid medium had eluded scientists for nearly eighty years.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/149.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Robert Brown</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Was it due to the interaction with water molecules? One explanation was that individual water molecules hit the pollen particles thus setting them in motion. This was clearly impossible as the particles were a few thousand times bigger than water molecules. Einstein was convinced that collision with one water molecule would not cause this motion. But millions of collisions occurring from different directions could cause the zigzag motion. He argued that these collisions when made from one side of the particle would set it in motion in one particular direction; the next series of collisions occurring from another side of the particle would change the direction of its motion. Einstein was quick to realise that there were two processes involved -- diffusion of particles inside a liquid and movement of particles or migration. He had already studied diffusion of sugar molecules in water. He combined the two effects and came up with a formula for Brownian Motion.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/150.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Brownian Mothion</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>It may be mentioned that Einstein was neither interested in Brownian Motion nor was it his mission to explain it. He was more concerned with thermal molecular motions of a micro scale within a liquid which could produce motion at a physically visible macro scale, and Brownian Motion was an illustration.</p>
			<p>Indirectly, Einstein provided evidence to validate the molecular theory which had by then been propounded. The importance of his evidence is clear in Einstein's words – “My main aim ..was to find facts that would guarantee as possible the existence of atoms of definite finite size ...The (experimental verification of the) statistical law ... of the Brownian Motion .. coupled with Planck’s determination of true molecular size from the law of radiation ... convinced the sceptics, who were quite numerous at the time of the reality of atoms.” These sceptics included the famous scientists of the time, Wilhelm Ostwald (the professor to whom Einstein had written seeking apprenticeship and who had later nominated him for the Nobel prize) and Ernst Mach.</p>
			<p>Thus, we see that Einstein was never interested in simple problems with limited scope. His enquiry was always into the heart of the matter. Phenomena such as Brownian Motion were only consequences.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Special Theory of Relativity</h2>
			<p>Einstein wrote his fourth paper in 1905 on the Special Theory of Relativity. A majority of the educated population in the world is aware that the theory was formulated by Einstein. But very few have really understood it.</p>
			<p>Entitled 'On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies', the paper was submitted to the journal Annalen der Physik on June 30, 1905. It is amazing that Einstein wrote this paper within fifteen weeks of writing the one on photoelectric effect. He also completed his doctoral thesis and wrote a paper on Brownian Motion.</p>
			<p>Relativity and relative motion are not difficult to understand. We experience relative motion in daily life. When we stand on the footpath and watch a car travelling at 60 km/h, we observe its motion. The car appears at a distance, comes closer and moves away from us. On the other hand, for the driver in the car, the observer on the footpath appears to be moving. If we watch the same car from inside another car which is also moving at 60km/h in the same direction, the car appears stationary. So in the first case, the car is moving at 60 km/h relative to a stationary observer on the footpath. In the second case, each car is stationary relative to the other. But relative to an observer on the footpath each is moving at 60 km/h. Moving trains provide a similar experience. For a commuter on the platform, the train appears to move. For a passenger seated in the train, the platform seems to move. We have all felt a sense of being stationary when our train is moving at a fixed speed and another train travels parallel to our train at the same speed and in the same direction.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/151.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Car in motion</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>We would have experienced the concept of relative speed at some point. If two cars are moving in the same direction, one at speed A and the other at speed B, then we say that their relative speed is A - B. When the speeds are equal, the relative speed is zero. So each car appears to be stationary, relative to the other. But to a person on the footpath, the cars are moving, each at speed A. When the cars are moving in opposite directions the relative speed is A+B. Thus the experience of very high speed when two trains approach each other from opposite directions. There is no way to determine who is moving and who is at rest. Movement and rest of an object are always relative to the movement and rest of another object.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Two cars in motion</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Einstein proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905. It is so called because it refers to objects in uniform motion (constant speed) without acceleration. Acceleration means change of speed either in magnitude or direction, or both. The simple examples we considered above belong to this class. When we start and accelerate our car, the car starts at zero speed and acquires running speed in a few seconds. We say that the car is accelerating. A ball which is thrown from a height is subject to the earth’s gravitational field and experiences a force. Its speed changes with time and hence it is not uniform motion. Einstein extended his theory to include acceleration, which came to be known as the General Theory of Relativity. We shall consider it later.</p>
			<p>In 1905, the term Relativity was not new to science. Galileo, in 1632, spoke about it in his famous Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Imagine a person who travels sitting in the cabin of a ship moving at uniform speed. There may be a few flies in the cabin. A passenger may have a bowl with water and fish. The movement of the fish, the flies and the passenger will continue in the same fashion as if the ship were at rest. The passenger cannot determine if the ship is moving or is at rest. This is the essence of the Theory of Relativity as explained by Galileo.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Speed of Light</h2>
			<p>Speed of light plays an important role in Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It may be recalled that he often fantasised about, “what the world would look like if I rode on a beam of light?” He complemented his fantasy with the collective knowledge about light and motion that had evolved till then. Einstein had mastered this knowledge and was preparing for a long time. His extraordinary insight and genius played a prominent role and the Theory of Relativity was born.</p>
			<p>We have already briefly discussed the contributions made to optics by Newton, Huygens and Maxwell. While Newton promoted the particle theory of light, Huygens promoted the wave theory. Maxwell synthesised all this information to prove that electricity, magnetism and light are all forms of energy. He also showed that all electromagnetic radiation travelled at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second, i.e. 300,000 km per second.</p>
			<p>Since sound required a medium to travel, it was assumed that light also required a medium to travel. Sound travelled through air; what medium would light travel through? Scientists believed that a substance called ether filled the universe through which light propagated. Some scientists performed experiments to determine if ether really existed. They theorised that the speed of light would depend upon whether the observer moved through ether towards its source or whether he moved away from its source. Hippolyte Fizeau, a French scientist carried out a study in water, but his conclusions never came out into the open.</p>
			<p>Two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, are credited for their conclusive study on the non-existence of ether in the earth’s atmosphere. They are known for the famous experiment they conducted in Cleveland, USA in 1887. They split a light beam and sent one part back and forth to a mirror placed in an arm in the direction of Earth’s motion. The other part was sent in a perpendicular direction. The two parts were later combined. If the speeds of the two parts were different the resulting image should have shown interference fringes. Surprisingly no interference patterns were observed. This led to the conclusion that the speeds of the two split beams of light were the same. More importantly, it confirmed the absence of ether. No such substance existed!</p>
			<p>That seems to be the turning point for Einstein, if we go by his statement, “Inability of Michelson and Morley to detect ether prompted me to come up with the Theory of Relativity.” Of course, we should remember that he has given many confusing, and often conflicting statements in this regard.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Michelson - Morley experiment</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>After much thought and deliberation, Einstein came up with a very bold hypothesis. He proposed that the speed of light did not depend upon the motion of its source. Any observer, therefore, independent of his own motion, measures the same value for the speed of light, c. Note that a particle theory of light or the presence of ether as a medium will not validate this hypothesis. Einstein, who had propounded the particle theory in his work on photoelectric effect, now upheld the wave theory.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Theory</h2>
			<p>It is time to define an Inertial Frame of Reference. When we describe motion we define it with respect to coordinates x, y and z. Usually, it is understood that the corresponding x, y and z axes are fixed in space. Consider the example of a train or an aeroplane moving at a uniform speed. Then, we may fix the x, y and z axes to the car or the train or the aeroplane. These are called Inertial Frames of Reference. Newton’s Laws of Motion are valid in both the fixed and the moving frames of reference.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/154b.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Inertial frames of reference</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The first postulate of the Special Theory of Relativity states that, “Laws of nature are the same for all inertial frames of reference.”</p>
			<p>The second postulate concerns speed of light and states, “Speed of light has the same value in all the inertial frames and is independent of the velocity of the observer or the source.”</p>
			<p>The consequences of these two postulates when considered individually appear to be very simple; but together, they are enormous. Scientists were familiar with the first postulate. The second postulate had also become common knowledge. The consequences of the two postulates when taken together rejected our commonly held beliefs of space and time. The usual manner of adding or subtracting two velocities did not work as far as propagation of light was involved.</p>
			<p>Time Dilation, Length Contraction, Twin Paradox and Loss of Simultaneity are some of the consequences of the Special Theory of Relativity. Let us examine them one by one.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-020.07">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Time Dilation</h2>
			<p>Consider a spacecraft in uniform motion at a speed of v metres per second. Beam a light pulse from the floor to the ceiling of the craft. The pulse traces a trajectory BA. Let the height of the ceiling be 4m from the floor. What is the time taken by the pulse to reach the ceiling? This is straightforward calculation. It takes 4/c seconds. Here c is the speed of light expressed in metres per second.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/155.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Time dilation</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Now consider an observer, such as a mission control official, who observes from outside the craft and is at rest. His experience is different. He, of course watches the pulse travel to the ceiling. But by the time the pulse hits the ceiling, the space craft itself has moved horizontally. The path of the pulse according to him is not BA, but CA. To simplify the argument let us say that CA is 5m. Therefore the observer on the ground concludes that the time taken by the pulse is 5/c seconds. Recall that c is the same for everyone.</p>
			<p>One can easily find a correlation between the two times. Let us denote the time as observed by a passenger in the spacecraft as tp and that observed by the ground observer as tg. Note that ABC is a right angled triangle. Pythagoras theorem tells us that</p>
			<p>AC<sup>2 </sup>= AB<sup>2</sup>+ BC<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>These distances are calculated as products of speed and time. Therefore, (ct<sub>g</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (ct<sub>p</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (vt<sub>g</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>On simplification we get,</p>
			<img src="images/156.jpg" alt="image"/>
			<p>When we consider the usual speeds we encounter, v is very small compared to c (300,000 km/sec). As a result the term within the square root sign in the above formula is almost 1 and the two times are almost equal. When we consider a motion which is closer to the speed of light the difference between the two times becomes noticeable. This phenomenon is called Time Dilation.</p>
			<p>The question is – Does the passenger in the spacecraft feel this effect? The answer is NO. Since the craft is moving at a uniform speed, no effect of motion is felt inside. It appears that all the processes inside the craft are reduced by the same ratio. This refers to the clocks inside, electronics, the very aging process of the passenger etc. As a result, the passenger in the space ship does not experience any change.</p>
			<p>What happens when one travels at the speed of light, i.e., v = c? According to the formula we have derived above, tp becomes zero. Time stands still! The astronaut will live forever.</p>
			<p>Is this all fact or fiction? Are we entering the realm of science fiction? Not at all. This is a fact. Scientists have performed experiments to prove that Time Dilation actually does take place. The subatomic particle called Muon has a lifespan of only 2.2x10-6 second. Thereafter, it becomes unstable and breaks into smaller particles. CERN the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, based in Geneva, Switzerland, (CERN houses particle accelerators and related equipment for carrying out high energy research) conducted an experiment in 1977 where muons were made to travel repeatedly in a circular orbit of 14 metres diameter at a speed of 0.9994c. Their average life span was observed to be 29.3 times longer than that for muons at rest. Substitute a value of 0.9994 for v/c in the above formula,</p>
			<img src="images/157.jpg" alt="image"/>
			<p>Many such experiments have proved beyond doubt the occurrence of Time Dilation as per the derived formula. Some of the experiments that are routinely performed in the accelerators have proven the validity of the formula.</p>
			<p>One question that arises is – Who is right? Is it the passenger in the spacecraft or the observer on the ground? Well, both are right. This points to the fact that there is no concept of absolute time. It is relative. In fact, the observer in the spacecraft, if he observes any phenomenon occurring on the ground, will conclude that the clock on the ground is running slow.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-020.08">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Twin Paradox</h2>
			<p>The phenomenon of Twin Paradox is an extension of Time Dilation. Imagine twins A and B. A being adventurous travels to space in a space ship that travels at uniform speed. In other words, it is in an inertial frame of reference. B is happy to stay home. A spends, let’s say, 25 years in space and returns home. A time period of 25 years for B on earth may only be 10 for A (who is moving in the spaceship) depending on the speed of movement. Thus, upon his return home, A finds that B has aged, while he has remained young. Imagine him travelling at speeds close to that of light. If he travels at the speed of a muon, as in the CERN experiment, he has aged only a year! This phenomenon is called Twin Paradox. However, it is only a theoretical paradox.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Length Contraction</h2>
			<p>A spacecraft travels to a distant planet. Let the distance between earth and the planet be s. We now have two times – tp for the passenger in the craft and tg for the observer on the ground. The passenger’s recorded time is shorter and he might conclude that he has arrived too soon. Why? We can work this out through simple math. The velocities and the time taken are known. So it is the distance that needs careful examination. Let us write these simple formulas.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/158b.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Length contraction</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>For the passenger,</p>
			<img src="images/159a.jpg" alt="image"/>
			<p>For the observer on the ground,</p>
			<p>s<sub>g</sub> = vt<sub>g</sub></p>
			<p>From these two equations we obtain,</p>
			<img src="images/159b.jpg" alt="image"/>
			<p>So, it appears, that to the passenger in the spacecraft the distance itself has contracted by the amount shown in the formula. The distance too becomes relative. This phenomenon is called Length Contraction.</p>
			<p>Now, let us consider a person flying from New Delhi to New York, covering a distance of 11,700 km. This is the distance measured at rest. Let us calculate the length contraction for an aircraft flying at a speed of 900 km/hr. By applying the above formula, the length contracts by a factor of 0.99999, i.e., distance reduces to 11,699.833 kms. This contraction of distance is however negligible and of no major consequence. So at speeds we encounter in everyday life, including flying in Boeing 777 or an Airbus, we do not notice any length contraction. We need to travel at speeds comparable to that of light to experience considerable length contraction. At a speed of 150,000 km/sec (half the speed of light) the distance becomes 10,132 kms. If we travel with a muon which moves at a speed of 0.9994 x300000 =299,820 km/s the distance between New Delhi and New York reduces to 405 kms. Therefore, length, i.e., distance is relative based on the speed of the observer. It is not the same for all observers. If one owns a plot of land measuring 100m x 40m, the sizes are true only for stationary observers. A moving surveyor will obtain a different value.</p>
			<p>Now the question is - where do such speeds occur? Why should we be concerned about effects of such high speeds? We do not have to go too far. Looking into an atom is sufficient. Many subatomic particles travel at speeds close to that of light. In studying these particles it becomes necessary to consider the relativistic effects. Another application which needs to factor in the consequences of Relativity to achieve high level precision data regards location of objects is the GPS system. The GPS system receives signals from satellites which are moving at high altitudes and high speeds. So, next time you use your GPS to guide you to some address, you are depending upon the Theory of Relativity.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Loss of Simultaneity</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/160a.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>As the passenger sees it</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Common sense suggests that two phenomena which occur simultaneously in one frame should do so in all frames of reference. The Theory of Relativity contradicts this assumption.</p>
			<p>Let us go back to the spacecraft example. Let there be two torches at the centre of the craft as shown. Let two pulses be fired - one in the direction of motion and the second in the direction opposite to that of motion of the spacecraft. One of them travels towards the rear end of the craft while the other travels towards the front end. Consider a passenger in the craft. To him the two pulses reach their targets simultaneously. How does the observer on ground perceive this situation? He finds that the rear end of the craft is rushing to meet the pulse while the front end (of the craft) is running away from it. Evidently, the pulse hits the rear end ahead of time while the pulse traveling towards the front end, much later, for the craft has moved since the pulse was fired. The effect gets exaggerated if the space craft travels at speeds comparable to that of light. Clearly simultaneity is lost.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/160b.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>As an observer on ground sees</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The question – Are these phenomena really simultaneous? – can hardly be answered. It depends upon whether you are in the space craft or standing on the ground. There is no absolute truth.</p>
			<p>However, a change in frame of reference cannot change the order of events. Consider this succession of events; a boy falls in front of a bus; the bus runs over him. Could there be some frame of reference wherein the events are reversed? Such that, the bus moves forward and the boy falls later? This scenario is impossible. If this were to happen, it would violate another important rule – Nothing can travel faster than light. It is the cosmic speed limit. If this were to be possible, then we would be able to travel to our past or our future! But let us not forget that there are places in some distant galaxy and to reach those places, light takes many, many years. If someone is living in those places, he will be seeing our past! Relativity is not associated with this phenomenon.</p>
			<p>Thus, the Special Theory of Relativity questions our common sense and challenges our built-in beliefs about the absoluteness of space and time. Newton supported our belief. Space was fixed while time was like a river that flowed ceaselessly at a constant rate. Einstein showed that both space and time are relative. Does it mean that we should discard Newton’s theory? Not really. His theory is sufficient for most of our calculations of speeds that are slower than that of light. Relativistic effects are essentially high speed effects.</p>
			<p>In an article he wrote to The Times of London, Einstein said, “Let no one suppose, however, that the mighty work of Newton can really be superseded by ( Relativity) or any other theory. His great and lucid ideas will retain their unique significance for all time as the foundation of our whole modern conceptual structure in the sphere of natural philosophy.”</p>
			<p>As mentioned earlier the Special Theory is valid for motions at uniform speeds. The question that arises is, “How about accelerating motion?” Einstein answered this question, 16 years later with his General Theory of Relativity.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Speed of Light is the ultimate</h2>
			<p>Science fiction is fond of travelling either to the future or to the past implying the possibility of faster than light travel. Is this possible at all? Can we move to a time before we even existed? It seems impossible. British physicist Russell Stannard’s discussion on this subject is interesting. According to Stannard, this speed limit (that nothing can travel faster than light) is true only for the types of matter currently available to us.</p>
			<p>There is some indication of the existence of matter which can allow speeds greater than c. Particles which travel faster than light are called Tachyons. Italian scientists in 2011 claimed that particles called Neutrinos can travel faster than light. However, their study remains inconclusive. E C G Sudarshan (Indian theoretical physicist and Professor at the University of Texas) has contributed considerably to the theoretical work on Tachyons. He has been credited with contributions to theoretical Physics in the areas of Optical coherence, Sudarshan-Glauber representation, V-A theory among others.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">E = mc<sup>2</sup></h2>
			<p>Einstein’s theory leads to the concept that energy of motion is associated with mass. Consequently we can define a rest mass, m0 as the mass associated with matter at rest. The Relativity Theory supports the deduction that we cannot have mass without energy and vice versa. The question is what do we associate with m0? Russell Stannard’s elaborate discussion on this matter is interesting. This rest mass is associated with a locked up energy which is represented by E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. Einstein wrote to his friend thus:</p>
			<p>“... Relativity principle, together with Maxwell’s equations, requires mass to be a direct measure of energy contained in a body. Light carries mass with it. With the case of radium there should be a noticeable reduction of mass.” Thus a large amount of energy is available within a given mass of any substance. How can this subatomic energy be harnessed? The two processes by which energy can be harnessed are - nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.</p>
			<p>Nuclear fission is the commonly used method to build atomic bombs. Some elements have a large unstable nucleus, which can be split into smaller nuclei. This process of splitting the nucleus into smaller nuclei, electrons and light pulses is called Fission. One such element with a large nucleus is an isotope of Uranium called <sup>235</sup>U. When its nucleus is bombarded by a neutron, it absorbs the neutron to become <sup>236</sup>U, which, however, is very unstable and splits to form Krypton <sup>92</sup>Kr and Barium <sup>141</sup>Ba. In the process, three neutrons and large amounts of energy are released. These neutrons, in turn, bombard the available <sup>235</sup>U and let loose a chain reaction, which releases tremendous amounts of energy. When the same reaction is controlled and harnessed, energy can be generated for power production. Nuclear fission produces large quantities of radioactive waste, disposing which has been a serious concern, as it remains active for many years to come.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/163.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Chain reaction</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Fusion is the process by which two smaller nuclei combine to form a bigger nucleus. The sum of energies of the two small nuclei is greater than that of the combined nucleus. The differential energy is released in the form of heat and light. The energy thus released is far greater than the energy released during fission, and thus is more destructive and dangerous. Hydrogen bomb is constructed using the fusion technology. This is also the process that converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 million tons of helium every second in the sun. The loss of 4 million tons of rest mass every second, accounts for the tremendous energy of the sun.</p>
			<p>Fusion is an attractive proposition to produce energy. The fusion of deuterium (2H, also called Heavy Hydrogen) and tritium (3H), the two isotopes of hydrogen produces a large amount of energy. These isotopes are found abundantly in seawater. A gallon of seawater is estimated to contain energy equivalent to 300 gallons of petrol. The advantage of fusion is that it does not produce dangerous waste products as in fission. However, the big disadvantage of fusion is that it requires very high temperatures of the order of ten million degrees Celsius to occur.</p>
			<p>So far we have discussed only the conversion of mass into energy. What about the conversion of energy into mass? Such conversions occur in particle accelerators, where particles are accelerated to high energy levels and allowed to collide. New particles, initially not present, are created after the interaction. An energy deficit is observed which is accounted for by the mass of the new particles. Pions and muons are among the new particles that are generated. The study of such particles and such phenomena falls into the realm of High Energy Physics or Fundamental Particle Physics. This is an area that studies speeds close to that of light. Consequently, Relativity is the underlying principle here.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">General Theory of Relativity</h2>
			<p>Here we will discuss some basic aspects of General Theory and some of its interesting consequences.</p>
			<p>It certainly is an exaggeration to say that when Einstein put forward his General Theory, only three people in the world understood it. Nevertheless, it is a complex theory for the common man to fully comprehend.</p>
			<p>So far, we have understood that the Special Theory of Relativity limited itself to systems moving in an inertial frame of reference; in other words systems moving at uniform speed. The adjective special was appended to it because it is only a special case of the General Theory. In General Theory of Relativity, Einstein considers systems that are accelerating; i.e., systems whose velocity may change in magnitude or direction.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Galileo and Free Fall</h2>
			<p>Galileo conducted an experiment in 1589 in which he dropped objects of different weights, such as spheres and feathers, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He expected each of them to hit the ground at the same time. He performed another experiment in which he rolled spheres of different weights down an inclined plane and measured the distance and time taken by the spheres to hit the ground. The experiment showed that the motion on an inclined plane had constant acceleration that depended only on the angle of the plane, and not the mass of the rolling body.</p>
			<p>In his Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment, Galileo had not considered the influence of air resistance on the outcome. But today it is possible to conduct such an experiment in a spacecraft where air resistance is absent. Experiments conducted in Apollo 15 mission, confirmed that a feather and a hammer would touch the floor at the same instant.</p>

				<figcaption>Both reach the ground at the same time and have an accelaration of 9.8 m/s/s<br />Galileo's experiment at the Leaning Tower of Pisa</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Galileo’s inclined plane experiment did establish that given a point in space where an object has some velocity, its subsequent motion is independent of the internal structure, composition or mass of the object, provided it is subject only to the gravitational force. This phenomenon is called the Universality of Free Fall, which was established long before Einstein.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Gravity and acceleration</h2>
			<p>What is the relationship between gravity and acceleration? Let us perform a thought experiment. Imagine a lift which is stationed on the ground. Let a ball be dropped inside the lift from near the ceiling. Pulled down by gravity, the ball falls to the floor with acceleration equal to g. This is shown as condition (a) in the figure. Now, imagine the lift to be taken away into space where there is no gravity. The ball does not fall down and remains near the ceiling as indicated in condition (b). Let us now connect a rocket to the lift and accelerate it upwards. There is no gravity. But the acceleration imposed by the rocket makes the ball drop in an opposite direction. In other words, the effect of acceleration and that of gravity are the same (condition (c)). In fact, a = g.</p>

				<figcaption>Free fall and equivalence</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Now imagine that the lift is brought back to a gravitational field and is dropped from the top of a building or a hill. The lift and the ball are accelerated downwards equally by gravity. Consequently, as shown in d, the ball does not drop to the floor of the lift. An observer within the falling lift experiences weightlessness. In other words, it is free fall. Thus, conditions (a) and (c) are equivalent; so are conditions (b) and (d).</p>
			<p>The experience of the astronauts in a spacecraft which is under a free fall due to the influence of earth’s gravity is similar to (b) or (d).</p>
			<p>Hidden within Newton’s theory is the belief that acceleration is absolute. By careful analysis and his audacious questioning of common sense, Einstein showed that even acceleration is relative. In 1907, he proposed the Theory of Equivalence, according to which, no internal experiment can reveal any difference between a small accelerated laboratory in space and a companion laboratory on the gravitational earth. This gives rise to the Weak Equivalence Principle, which implies that motion under acceleration and gravity are equivalent. This takes us back to Galileo and his experiment. Galileo stated that the velocities attained by two bodies dropped from a height are the same, irrespective of their size and mass. In other words, they reach the ground at the same time. Einstein generalized Galileo’s observations.</p>
			<p>In effect, the equivalence principle allows us to swap acceleration and gravity. We can study effects of gravitation by employing acceleration and vice versa.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Effect of Gravity and Acceleration on Time</h2>
			<p>To understand better the effects of gravity and acceleration on time, let us perform some experiments. Consider a spacecraft which is stationary. Let there be a source of light on the floor sending pulses towards the ceiling at a frequency f. When the spacecraft is not moving, the pulse hits the ceiling at the same frequency, namely   f.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/167.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Gravitational redshift</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Now, let the spacecraft accelerate and start moving upwards. We find that the pulse starts with a frequency f, but by the time it completes its mission, the ceiling is moving away with a velocity v. This phenomenon is called the Doppler Effect, whereby the received frequency f’ is lower than f. The resultant shift in frequency is called the Doppler Shift. Thus, the observer near the ceiling on the spacecraft concludes that the emitted frequency is lower than f. This phenomenon is known as Gravitational Redshift, whereby the indicated frequency has moved towards red in the spectrum. Einstein discovered this in 1911. Now imagine a clock that is built on the basis of these pulses, i.e., a clock that measures time by counting the number of pulses received. Then, an observer near the ceiling of the craft would think that the clock on the floor is running slow.</p>
			<p>If there is Gravitational Redshift, there should also be a Gravitational Blueshift. This occurs when the pulse that is travelling and the pulse’s destination part of the craft are approaching each other. Assume that the pulse is generated at the ceiling and it travels to the floor. Then an observer on the floor measures a higher frequency than f.</p>
			<p>This leads to the conclusion that in a gravitational field the clock which is at a lower altitude runs slower. In fact, it is time itself that has slowed down.</p>
			<p>Does it read like science fiction? Well, experiments have been performed to verify these effects. Russell Stannard lists a number of such experiments in his book. The first evidence of redshift came from a study of spectra emitted by the white dwarf stars. In 1960, scientists at the Princeton University measured the redshift for light emitted by the sun. Measurements have been made with neutron stars which have a mass 1.4 times that of the sun, but a diameter of only 10 kms. Thus, the gravity that they exert is enormous. In 2002, a shift of 35% frequency was measured.</p>
			<p>Scientists have also flown atomic clocks in aeroplanes to verify the frequency shift. Of course, in these measurements, allowance was made for time dilation itself (refer Special Theory). Experiments were conducted in 1971, when one clock was flown east and the other west. The times recorded by these clocks were compared to the ones at the US Naval Observatory. As per calculations, a clock travelling east should have gained 144±14 nanoseconds and lost 184±14 ns because of time dilation. Expected loss of time is 40±23 ns. The measurements gave a value of 59±10 ns. A clock travelling west was to gain 179±18 ns with a time dilation of 96±10 ns giving a shift of 275±21 ns. The measurements gave 273±7 ns.</p>
			<p>A measurement made with a rocket in 1976 at an altitude of 10,000 kms has given a blue shift accurate to 2 in 104.</p>
			<p>Thus, time runs faster at an altitude. So, if ever you are disgusted with this world, you should spend more time upstairs! But do not forget you may die quicker!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Light bends in gravity</h2>
			<p>The fact that a beam of lights bends in gravity, is an essential part of the General Theory of Relativity and is the one that helped validate it. The question that arises now is, what happens to a beam of light in an accelerating field?</p>
			<p>Let us go back to the spacecraft example. Let us fire a beam of light from one side of the craft to the other. Note that as before, this beam is at right angles to the motion of the craft. Let the space craft be away from the effect of gravity. If it is accelerated by a rocket, to an outside observer, the light beam merely takes a horizontal path and hits the other side as shown in (a). For an astronaut inside, there is a difference. By the time the light beam reaches the opposite wall the craft has moved up. Light strikes at a position below the target and seems to be bent downwards as shown in (b). The space craft is stationary, on the ground under the effect of gravity in condition (c). The light beam appears to be bent as observed in (b).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/169.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Light bends in gravity</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Einstein made this prediction in 1915. It appeared that light from distant stars should bend when they come near a gravitational field, the sun, for instance. Scientists discovered a deflection, albeit very small, of 1.75 seconds of arc.</p>
			<p>Observing distant stars on regular days proves difficult due to the acute brightness of the sun. During a total solar eclipse sighting and observing stars becomes possible with the moon covering the sun. Sir Arthur Eddington, the British scientist, did exactly this in 1919 and proved Einstein right. In recent times, experiments have been performed at higher altitudes where the brightness of the sun ceases to be a problem. Einstein’s prediction has been verified to an accuracy of 0.7%.</p>
			<p>Newton’s theory had also predicted such a bending. It is based on his particle theory of light. Light particles bend because of gravity. But the amount of bending near the sun according to his theory was only half of what Einstein predicted.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Gravitational Lensing</h2>
			<p>Many interesting phenomena occur due to the bending of light in a gravitational field. Galaxies or clusters of galaxies can contribute to bending light from a distant source. In 1979, scientists observed what seemed to be two identical quasars close to each other. But one of them was actually a virtual image of the quasar, the handiwork of bending light. Repeated bending can result in strange patterns known as Gravitational Lensing. The magnification it can yield has helped astronomers discover a planet around a distant star in 2004.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Curved Space – Time</h2>
			<p>Isaac Newton had proposed his theory of gravitation more than two hundred years before. He held a mechanical view of the universe. According to him, gravitational force existed between earth and other objects, between planets etc. It could act over short or long distances.</p>
			<p>In reality, there is no mechanical connection between them. The force of attraction or gravity simply existed between any two objects. Nothing was transmitted between them.</p>
			<p>When Einstein started working, Maxwell’s Electromagnetic Theory had already been established. According to this theory, a field exists between objects. This field gives rise to a force, i.e., gravitational force and this force is transmitted between two objects. But we know that nothing can travel faster than light. Consequently, even this gravitational force should have a finite speed. Therefore, there cannot be instantaneous transmission of force between two objects.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/171.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Space time curvature</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This was the dilemma that Einstein faced. How was he to relate gravity and electromagnetic theory?</p>
			<p>We have seen that the feather and the hammer are treated equally by gravity. This is also true of an astronaut who goes out of a spaceship and floats alongside it. The two traverse the same trajectory. Einstein asked himself another question. Gravity pulls a light object and a heavy object in the same manner i.e., with the same acceleration. How does it manage to do it? What is the secret?</p>
			<p>Einstein was at his best again and with a masterstroke amazed the world. He dismissed the notion that a body in a gravitational field can remain stationary or travel along a straight line. “Instead” he said, “in a gravitational field space itself becomes curved or distorted. Any object that finds itself there automatically follows the natural path which is the one we actually observe it to be.” The implication is that the feather and hammer have to follow that path; there is no option. The spaceship and the astronaut are merely following a laid out track!</p>
			<p>Out went the notion of the existence of a gravitational force that acted between two objects. Instead, what exists is a curved space which directs the motion of objects. Shortly, we will see that it is not just space, but it is actually a space time curvature. For the time being, let us understand curved space and extend the concept later.</p>
			<p>How do we understand this curved space? It is easy. Compare space to an elastic mattress . When a heavy object is placed on it, the mattress gets distorted. This is curved space. Einstein suggested that the curvature of space determines the path of motion for any object that falls within its range.</p>
			<p>So our galaxy is like a huge mattress with the sun, the earth and other planets placed on it. The mattress gets distorted by each of these. The curvature around the planet determines the gravity around it. Obviously, bigger the star or planet, more the curvature around it.</p>
			<p>Besides, we should consider time as well. We have seen that gravity causes phenomenon such as redshift, blueshift etc. So, three dimensions describe space; call them x, y and z. In addition we have time t. The spatial coordinates and time are interdependent. This is to say that we live in a four dimensional continuum called the Space Time Continuum. This may also be called Curved Spacetime.</p>
			<p>The paths that objects take in this four dimensional continuum are called geodesics. It is the path taken by an object during free fall. What was a straight line in an inertial frame (Special Theory) now becomes a geodesic. For example, the path taken by light from a distant star that bends as it nears the sun.</p>
			<p>In the words of Russell Stannard, “The crux of general Relativity is that matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move. Space is no longer to be regarded as a passive stage on which the actors – material objects and light – perform the drama. Space itself becomes a performer.”</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-020.20">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Equations</h2>
			<p>It is almost impossible to picture the four dimensional space time continuum. We can only grasp a three dimensional space. But such a limitation does not exist in mathematics. There are equations which can account for not just four, but any number of dimensions. This is what Einstein succeeded in; he conceived an equation that accounts for the relativistic effects. Of course, these are far more complicated than Newton’s conceptions and theories.</p>
			<p>The equations also needed special tools. Einstein used the Tensor Calculus developed by Ricci in 1887. He was also helped by Grossmann. The equation is given below.</p>
			<p>R<sub>μϑ</sub>–½g<sub>μϑ</sub>R=8T<sub>μϑ</sub></p>
			<p>In the above equation, R<sub>μν</sub> is called the Ricci Tensor and is a part of the curvature of space time that determines the degree to which matter converges or diverges in time. g<sub>μν</sub> is the important Metric Tensor and captures the geometric and causal structure of space time. R is the Ricci Scalar. T<sub>μν</sub> is the stress energy tensor. Simply stated, the equation helps calculate how an object distorts the space time around it and its subsequent effect on motion.</p>

				<figcaption>Precession of Mercury</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Scientists had made a curious observation about the planet Mercury. It is the closest to the sun and the sun’s gravity acts strongly on it. Mercury’s orbit is elliptical with the sun as one of the foci. The point of interest is the perihelion. The perihelion is the point on the elliptical orbit closest to the sun. According to Newton’s theory, Mercury traced the same orbit each time and the perihelion remained at the same position, represented as p in the diagram (a). But it was observed that the perihelion moved during every successive revolution of Mercury around the sun shown, as p1, p2 and p3 in the diagram (b). This is called the Precession of the perihelion of Mercury, at 43 seconds of arc in a century, really very negligible. While Newton’s theory could not predict it, Einstein’s theory readily did so.</p>
			<p>In 1974, Taylor and Hulse discovered a pulsar named PSR 1913+16. As predicted by the Theory of Relativity, the pulsar’s perihelion was moving at 4.2 degrees per year.</p>
			<p>Another verification of the General Theory was attempted by sending radar pulses to distant planets and allowing them to be bounced back to earth. The procedure was repeated when the planet was behind the sun. The theory predicts that there is a delay as the pulse passes near the sun. Experiments have been repeated for Mercury and Venus employing artificial satellites. The most accurate measurement was made in 2003, which proved that the theory was right to within 1 in 10-5.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Einstein vs Newton</h2>
			<p>Our discussion naturally leads to the question – Should we then abandon all that Newton said? The answer is, certainly not. Even today, in most circumstances we use Newton’s theories. In fact, for all situations in which the speeds are what we encounter in everyday life, Newton’s theories are quite adequate and accurate. Engineering design work, calculations in Fluid Mechanics are carried out using the Newtonian Theory. Aeroplanes fly following his laws.</p>
			<p>At high speeds close to that of light we have to include the relativistic effects. One such we have seen is the bending of light near a powerful gravitational field. The value obtained by Newton was only half the actual deflection. Relativity is relevant in the subatomic world dominated by particles that travel at speeds close to that of light.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Black Holes</h2>
			<p>Black holes are a curiosity; they feature in stories and movies; youngsters, science fiction enthusiasts are thrilled by them. What are they? What has Relativity to do with them?</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/174.jpg" alt="image"/>
				<figcaption>Black hole</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>A star is fuelled by nuclear fusion that is generated within it. There is equilibrium between the enormous power of fusion on the one hand and gravity on the other. The strength of gravity depends upon the size of the star. However, this equilibrium cannot exist forever. The star will eventually run out of fuel. Then gravity takes the upper hand. Upon its death, a star becomes a black hole.</p>
			<p>After burning steadily for about 10, 000 million years, a star, the size of our sun, becomes a Red Giant. The star then sheds its outer layers and becomes a White Dwarf. A star which has a mass of 8 suns dies with a supernova explosion, and gravity takes the upper hand. The core becomes so small that the electrons circling the atoms are pushed into the nucleus. Thus they combine with protons and neutrons in the nucleus to produce more neutrons and neutrinos. These neutrinos are responsible for blasting out materials on explosion. The nucleus is now left only with neutrons, giving the star the name Neutron Star. Typically, a neutron star may have a mass that is 1.4 times that of the sun, with a size of may be 20 kms in diameter while the gravity may be 2x1011 times that on the earth. If the earth were to attain this condition its radius would be 1 cm while for our sun it would be 3 kms.</p>
			<p>Just imagine the consequences; the gravity is so strong that it is impossible for any object to overcome it. In fact, the volume of the star collapses until it becomes zero! But the mass remains the same. So, in effect density becomes infinite. This denotes the birth of a Black Hole. Oppenheimer and Snyder, in 1939 had predicted this based on the Theory of Relativity. The name Black Hole was given later in 1967 by Robert Wheeler.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Space time near a black hole</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The possible distortion of space (really space time) close to a black hole is indicated in the figure. The curve almost reduces to a point as we go down. This is a singularity. Further, when the spatial dimensions become so small we enter the regime of atoms and particles where quantum mechanics comes into play. Schwarzschild has contributed substantially to the understanding of black holes.</p>
			<p>No object can come out of a black hole; not even light. A black hole absorbs any light that falls in it and does not reflect anything. So it appears black, hence the name. It has been compared to mighty waterfalls. If one is carried away by one such, there is no point of return as happens in a black hole.</p>
			<p>There are different types of black holes. The Stellar Black Hole is formed when a star collapses. The Galactic Black Hole is formed when a galaxy collapses. There is a black hole at the centre of every galaxy. Our own Milky Way galaxy has one with a mass of 3 million solar masses. Mini Black Holes do not have enough gravity to compress them, but they can be compressed by an external pressure.</p>
