		<p>The Hata Yoga Pradipika says that, “ One becomes a sidda (perfect)  through practice alone and not by merely reading the scriptures or  changing the colour of the cloth or discussing about it.  Anyone young,  old, weak or sick who practices relentlessly  with dedication will attain  perfection in yoga ”.</p>
		<p>The first section in this book deals with<strong> Surya Namaskara</strong>. <strong>Surya Namaskara</strong> also referred to as  Sun Salutation is gaining popularity all over the world. Many, substitute intense workouts with <strong>Surya Namaskaras</strong> and label these as  Suryathons . The scriptures propound that  whatever one does should be divinised and offered as Yajna  (worship)  in order to derive full benefits. With this understanding a Suryathon can be transformed into a  Surya Yajna .</p>
		<p>Surya Namaskara is undoubtedly a complete solution for one’s psychosomatic – body and mind well-being. It de-stresses the mind and strengthens the  circulatory ,  respiratory ,  digestive ,  excretory ,  reproductive, nervous  and  endocrine  systems.</p>
		<p><em>In an exercise to analyse the benefits and effects of </em><strong>Surya Namaskara</strong> on my body, I performed 108  repetitions of the 16<strong>-step Surya Namaskara</strong>  in 18  minutes and recorded the following observations: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Rise in heart rate from 80  bpm to 160  bpm. </li>
			<li> Drop in blood pressure from 120 /80  to 100 / 60</li>
			<li>Decrease in body weight by about half a kilogram.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The effects of Surya Namaskara reach far beyond the psychosomatic level to benefit the practitioner at the soul (jiva) level . </p>
		<p> Shat Prashnopanishad says that the soul ( jiva) is bound by 15 things and they are:</p>
		<p>1. <strong>Kham</strong>: Space 2. <strong>Vayu</strong>: Air 3. <strong>Agni</strong>: Fire 4. <strong>Aapa</strong>: Water 5. <strong>Pritvi</strong>: Earth 6. <strong>Karmendriya</strong> and <strong>Jnanendriya</strong>: Legs, hands, mouth, anus, genital, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin 7. <strong>Mana</strong>: Mind 8. <strong>Ahara</strong>: Food – type of food we eat 9. <strong>Veerya</strong>: Stamina – getting fat or lean 10. <strong>Tapa</strong>: Thinking 11. <strong>Mantra</strong>: Talking 12. <strong>Karma</strong>: Action- what we think; that we do. 13. <strong>Loka</strong>: Our possessions, properties 14. <strong>Nama</strong>: Name and Fame- we do things for name and fame 15. <strong>Shradda</strong>: Belief – family traditions, social beliefs, our convictions etc.</p>
		<p>The number 16 represents the <strong>jiva</strong> ( soul), number 17 represents <strong>Prakruti</strong> ( Lakshmi ) and number 18 represents the <strong>Purusha</strong> ( Narayana ). By divinising <strong>Surya Namaskara</strong> the soul ( jiva) can be progressed towards Purusha. This is the definition of Yoga – joining the individual soul ( jiva ) with the Supreme ( Purusha, Paramatma ).</p>
		<p>The second section of this book explains <strong>Pranayama</strong> in detail. <strong>Pranayama</strong> helps in purifying the nadis ( subtle pathways of prana  / breath). When the nadis are purified - the frequency of breathing can be reduced thereby leading to longevity, digestive fire becomes activated, inner sound can be heard and perfect health can be enjoyed. <strong>Pranayama</strong> is the link between the body and the mind. <strong>Pranayama</strong> helps in improving the body immunity. The  Sandhya Vandana  pranayama  has been included in the <strong>Pranayama</strong> section for the benefit of all serious spiritual seekers.</p>
		<p><strong>Mudras</strong> and <strong>Bandhas</strong> are dealt with in the third section. <strong>Mudras</strong> and <strong>Bandhas</strong> help in conserving and redirecting the energy within the body. The inner energy must be channelised properly for the inherent personality to blossom.</p>
		<p>The fourth section deals with <strong>acupressure</strong> points in the palms and feet. Diseases frequent the body when the flow of energy in the nadis is obstructed. When these blocks are cleared, the body becomes disease free. The energy blocks can be removed and the whole body can be energised in a fun and simple way by combining star jumps with hand-claps.</p>

		<p>My earlier book is called Vasudeva Kriya Yoga – Divinity in Yoga. This book also follows the footsteps of my earlier book by divinising Surya Namaskara.</p>
		<p>I am offering this book to my dear father, Late Shri Damodara, who was a great Karma Yogi and a devotee of the Lord.</p>
		<p>I thank many students and volunteers for their continued support in bringing out this book.</p>
		<p>I thank Shri Pranesh from Prism Books Pvt Ltd for editing and publishing this book.</p>
		<p>This book is dedicated to all the students of Yoga.</p>
