<p>In the fourth chapter of the Bhagawat Gita, Pranayama is defined as <em>Apane juhwati pranam pranapane tathapare pranapana gatee rudwa pranayama parayana </em> <span class="dev">(अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे । प्राणापनगती रुद्ध्वा प्राणायामपरायणाः ।।)</span>- 'Yogis join the downward flowing prana with the upward flowing prana.' Restraining the breath in or out through antar kumbaka or bahya kumbaka is Pranayama.</p>

<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Pranayama</h1>
<p>The real strength to the body comes from the breath. When we want to lift a heavy weight, we inhale and lift it. A boxer before giving the punch, inhales and with exhale gives the punch. A cricket bowler before releasing the ball inhales and with exhalation releases the ball. Yogi becomes strong both physically and mentally by doing pranayama.</p>
<p>It is said that, "those who know the art of breathing, for them, there is no disease". Breath is a link between our body and mind. Like jockey controls the horse through the reins, yogi manages the mind through breath. Whenever we are agitated, angry and restless, our breathing becomes jerky and shallow. Whenever we are calm and relaxed, the breathing becomes smooth and longer. Breathing is an outward indication of the status of our mind.</p>
<p>Mind can be controlled and managed well through the practice of pranayama. So, pranayama is an important tool for managing our emotions and for maintaining good mental health. “Breathing with awareness is called pranayama”.</p>
<p>Prana is not just breathing. Breathing is the external sign of prana. Yogis can live without breathing for a long time. When the Prana leaves the body, breathing stops and that body is then called dead. Since we have prana in the body we are called <em>“Prani.” </em></p>
<p><em>Pra </em> means <em> prakrista </em>which means special. <em>Ana</em> means <em>bala,</em> meaning strength. That which gives strength to us is Prana. There are three Pranas -- <em>Mukhya Prana</em> (main Prana), <em>Madhyama Prana</em> (middle level Prana) and <em>Adhama Prana</em> (lower Prana). The Supreme indweller, the Lord is <em>Mukhya Prana</em>. Hanuman, who is the vehicle of the Lord, is <em>Madhyama Prana</em>. The individual soul is called <em>Adhama Prana</em>. The <em>Madyama Prana</em> (or Prana) is the Guru for all souls (jivas) who takes them to the <em>Mukhya Prana</em>. Prana takes the individual soul after death to the appropriate destination according to the soul’s karma. There is no rest for Prana, who makes us breathe even when we are asleep.</p>
<p>Prana protects the soul even at the time of universal dissolution. When the <em>Mukhya Prana</em> (Lord) decides to leave the body, Prana also leaves the body. The <em>Shat Prashnopanishad</em> says that the Lord wanted a perfect personal assistant and he chose Prana. In <em>Vishnu Sahsranama</em>, the Lord has been described twice as using Prana as His vehicle - <em>Vayu Vahana</em>. The Vedas refer to Prana as <em>dhoo,</em> meaning that death does not come near him. Death is scared to come near those who practice Pranayama.</p>
<p>Our scriptures say that we have various deities who function in the body, like the Sun in the eyes, the Moon in the ears, the Aswini Kumaras in our nostrils, Agni in our mouth, Shiva in the mind, etc. These deities can function in our body only when we have the Prana (vital air) in the body. When the Prana leaves the body, all other deities cannot function any more. <em>Pranayama</em> means getting the grace of <em>Mukhya Prana</em> (the Lord) and <em>Madhyama Prana</em> (Prana- Hanuman) so that <em>Adhama Prana’s</em> (the jiva’s or soul’s) journey towards the Lord continues without any hindrances.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter of the Bhagawat Gita, <em>Pranayama</em> is defined as <em>Apane juhvati pranam pranapane tathapare pranapana gatee rudwa pranayama parayana </em> <span class="dev">(अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे । प्राणापनगती रुद्ध्वा प्राणायामपरायणाः ।।)</span> - ‘Yogis join the downward flowing prana with the upward flowing prana.’ Restraining the breath in or out through antar kumbaka or bhahya kumbaka is Pranayama.</p>
<p>Patanjali defines <em>Pranayama</em> as <em>Tasmin Sati Swasa Praswasa Yorgati Vicheedana Pranayama</em> -- ‘after mastering the <em>posture, one must practice control of Prana by regulat</em>ing the inhalation and exhalation.’ Patanjali further describes the benefits of <em>Pranayama</em> as <em>Tata Ksheeyate Prakasha avaranam</em> ‘The result of <em>Pranayama</em> is that the covering of the <em>inner Light</em> is removed.’ According to the Gheranda Samhita, the body becomes light and energetic by doing <em>Pranayama</em> correctly.</p>
<p>There are 4 phases in Pranayama. They are <em>puraka</em> (inhale), <em>rechaka</em> (exhale), <em>antar kumbhaka</em> (retaining air inside) and <em>bahya kumbhaka</em> (holding air outside).</p>
<p>By doing Pranayama, all ten pranas are energized. There are five main pranas and five subtle pranas (<em>upa pranas</em>). The pranas and their functions are given below:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th><strong>Main Prana</strong></th>
<th><strong>Upa Prana (subtle prana)</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Prana</em>- Mukha indriya - the whole face <em>indriya</em> - eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin</td>
<td><em>Dhanajaya</em>: Opening and closing of the heart valve; protection of the body even after death</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Apana</em>- Anus - Excretion.</td>
<td><em>Naga</em>: Burping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Vyana</em>- Affects the whole body -- Gives movement to joints.</td>
<td><em>Devadatta</em>: Yawning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Udana</em>- Throat -- Speech, swallowing. Guides the soul at the time of death. Takes our mind to higher levels.</td>
<td><em>Krikala</em>: Sneezing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Samana</em>- Navel- Digestion and distribution of food</td>
<td><em>Kurma</em>: Blinking</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Humans normally breathe 15-20 times a minute. Rabbits breathe 60-70 times a minute. Elephants breathe 5-6 times a minute. Tortoises breathe 2-3 times a minute. Rabbits live for 3-5 years. Elephants live for over 100 years. The tortoise lives for about 250 years. There is a direct correlation between lifespan and rate of breathing. By reducing the breathing rate, life expectancy is increased. Lifespan is measured in terms of the number of breaths one takes and not by the number of years one lives. Some mosquitos have a life span of only 6 hours. In 6 hours they completes their birth, growth, maturity and death.</p>
<p>It is said in <em>Shrimad Bhagawatam</em> that the creator Brahma’s one second is equal to 100,000 human years. Brahma’s 100 years is 3,11040,0000,000,00 (31,104 billion) human years. After Brahma’s 100 years of life span, he gets liberated and takes all the liberated souls along with him to <em>Vaikunta</em>(place with no defects) where he will be replaced by another Brahma. Everyone lives for 100 years but on a different scale. We have heard about yogis living for hundreds of years. This is because they knew the art of breathing. The slower we breathe, the longer is our life span. When we are stressed or angry, our breathing rate increases which in turn reduces our life span.</p>
<p>According to the scriptures, when we are relaxed it takes 2 seconds for inhalation and 2 seconds for exhalation. For one cycle of inhalation and exhalation, it takes 4 seconds. In one minute we breathe 15 times. In one hour we breathe 900 times and in one day we breathe 21,600 times. When we breathe 21,600 times, it is 1 day for the body. Instead of taking 4 seconds per cycle, by Pranayama practice if we take 8 seconds, it takes 2 days on the external clock to complete 21,600 breaths, which is one day by our inner clock. Our inner clock (body) may say 100 years, but the outer clock says 200 years. If we take 16 seconds per cycle, for 100 years of the inner clock, the outer clock says 400 years. Instead, if we are under stress and prone to anger, we take 2 seconds per breath cycle, to do 21,600 breaths it takes only 12 hours on the external clock. It may be 100 years for the body, but the outer clock has done only 50 years. In short, the slower we breathe, the longer we live.</p>
<p><em>Pranayama</em> slows down our breathing and reveals the inner light by removing its covering. In <em>kumbhaka</em> (breath retention), the body function goes into hibernation. By doing <em>Pranayama</em> one is able to live one’s full life span without disease. When we breathe slowly, our mind de-stresses itself and gets relaxed. The relaxed mind expands. An expanded mind is creative. Creativity is one of the hallmarks of a true leader. <em>Pranayama</em> makes us lead our life well. When we lead our life well, we also inspire others.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hata Yoga and Pranayama</h2>
%raghu, page 51
<p><em>Hata</em> means force. <em>Hata</em> means determination. <em>Hata</em> means not giving up till the goal is reached. <em>Hata </em>means perseverance. <em>Hata</em> means patience. <em>Hata</em> means endurance -- enduring the difficulties in life to achieve the noble goal in life.</p>
<p>To achieve the noble goal in life one needs to be physically healthy, mentally stable and spiritually fit. The weak cannot get the highest as the Mundakopanishad says <em>nayam atma balaheenena labyaha </em> <span class="dev">(नायमात्मा बलहीनेन लभ्यः ।)</span>. <em>Practice of Hata Yoga helps us to realise our goal by awakening the dormant energy in us -- called kundalini shakti</em>.</p>
<p>Hata Yoga says that the <em>sadhaka</em>, practioner of yoga perishes by six causes - over eating, over talking, too much of physical labour, observance of unsuitable vows, bad company and unsteadiness.</p>
<p>Yogi succeeds by inculcating six qualities - cheerfulness, perseverance, courage, true knowledge, firm belief in the words of the guru and by abandoning wrong company.</p>
<p>Patanjali says the same in different words in his Yoga Sutra that a student of yoga should follow Yama and Niyama.</p>
<p>There are five qualities in <em>yama</em> which are <em>ahimsa</em> (non injury),<em> satya</em> (truthfulness),<em> asteya</em> (non stealing), <em>brahmacharya</em> (self restraint and higher vision in life) and a<em>parigraha</em> (non hoarding).</p>
<p>There are five qualities in <em>niyama</em> which are <em>shoucha</em> (cleanliness),<em> santosha </em>(cheerfulness), <em>tapas</em> (austerity), <em>swadhyaya </em>(contemplating on the scriptures) and <em>iswara pranidana</em> (surrender to the Lord).</p>
<p>The above discipline prepares the student for a deeper journey in to yoga.</p>
<p>Doing the asanas makes the yogi firm, free from diseases and laziness. When body is cleansed of impurities, doing asana becomes easier. The gross impurities are removed through Shat Karma Kriyas and subtle impurities are removed through asana and subtler impurities are removed through pranayama and subtlest impurities are removed through <em>mantra japa</em>.</p>
<p>There are six <em>hata yoga kriyas</em>. They are <em>Neti</em> (cleaning the sinus through the nose), <em>Dhauti</em> (cleaning the wind and food pipe), <em>Nauli </em>(churning the stomach muscles),<em> Basti </em>(cleaning the lower and upper intestine), <em>Kapalabhati</em> (cleaning the sinus and head by active exhale and passive inhale) and <em>Tratak</em> (gazing on light).</p>
<p>By doing pranayama, the nadis get purified. When nadis gets purified, the prana goes in to the central nadi called -- <em>sushumna nadi.</em> The indication that the prana has started going through the <em>sushumna</em> <em>nadi </em>is that the yogi experiences the bliss within and hears the inner sound.</p>
<p>By the practice of pranayama along with proper diet and proper <em>mudra</em>s and <em>bandhas</em> one is freed from diseases. By wrong practice one develops various diseases like asthma, headache, cough and many more.</p>
<p>Like taming the elephant one should tame the mind by gradually building mastery over one’s breath. Doing pranayama has a calming effect on the mind. Mind has different levels -- unconscious mind, conscious mind, sub-conscious mind and super-conscious mind. When pranayama is practiced properly the dynamic, active, restless mind is quietened. When the mind is quietened, the intuition starts working and one experiences the new revelations and one experiences an immense joy. This is called as <em>unmani avasta</em> or <em>asamprajana samadhi</em> or <em>turiya avasta.</em></p>
<p>In the human body there are 72,000 nadis (energy carrying nerves) of which 36,000 are called female nadis (<em>Ida</em>) and 36,000 are called as male nadis (<em>Pingala</em>). Wherever the nadis meet, they form an energy centre called a <em>chakra</em>. Generally, energy does not flow properly in the body because of impurities. This is cleaned by the process of various asanas, pranayams and yoga kriyas.</p>
<p>In Hata yoga, <em>Ha </em>means Sun and<em> Ta</em> means Moon. Hata also means +ve and --ve energy. Hata yoga brings Sun and Moon centres together so that Prana moves through the <em>Sushumna</em> <em>nadi </em>(central nadi). Although we have two nostrils, the breathing usually happens only through one nostril. The left nostril is connected to the right brain. It is called <em>Ida nadi</em> (Moon nadi). Breathing in through the left nostril cools down the body. When the body get heated through emotions, Prana moves through the left nostril <em>(Ida)</em> to cool the body down.</p>
<p>The <em>ida nadi</em> (Moon nadi) nourishes our body. The <em>pingala nadi</em> (Sun nadi) consumes and degenerates the body. Balancing the moon and sun system in the body is pranayama. If Sun is weak in the body, person can go in to depression easily. On the other hand, if moon is weak in the body, person can become hyper active and restless and age quickly. So pranayama balances the Sun and Moon systems in the body.</p>
<p>The right nostril is connected to the left brain. It is called <em>Pingala nadi</em> (Sun nadi). Breathing in through the right nostril heats up the body. When the body get cooled down through calm and clear thinking, Prana moves through the right nostril <em>(Pingala Nadi)</em> to warm and energize the body.</p>
<p>This alternate switching happens every 2-3 hours or so. Practicing <em>Pranayama</em> makes the Prana travel through the central <em>Sushumna nadi.</em> By bringing the prana to the<em> Sushumna Nadi</em> (bringing sun and moon systems together), our mind will not be disturbed and swing like a pendulum with every passing thought and emotion. This is done through <em>Nasika shuddi</em> (cleaning the nasal passage) and <em>Nadi shuddi</em> (cleaning the nadis) <em>Pranayama</em>.</p>
<p>Hata yoga also means <em>Ida </em>and <em>Pingala</em>. <em>Ha</em> means the sun system which is <em>Pingala</em>. <em>Ta</em> means the moon system which is <em>Ida</em>. <em>Pingala</em> is also referred to as the river <em>Yamun</em>a, and <em>Ida</em> is referred to as the river <em>Ganga</em>. Where Ganga and <em>Yamuna</em> meet, that place is called <em>Prayag</em>, and there the third river <em>Saraswati </em>emerges giving it the name <em>Triveni Sangam</em> -- the meeting of three rivers. <em>Sushumna nadi</em> is referred to as the river <em>Saraswati</em>. <em>Ida</em> and<em> pingala</em> run through the spinal column like a DNA helix, and wherever they cross the <em>Sushumna nadi</em>, that place is called an energy centre or <em>chakra. Ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> cross each other along the central <em>Sushumna nadi</em> in seven places which are the seven main chakras - <em>Mooladhara, Swadistana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishudda, Ajna </em>and <em>Sahasrara.</em></p>
<p><em>Ida</em> is referred to as feminine and <em>pingala</em> is referred to as masculine in nature. A person with predominant ida nadi is usually heart centered and likely to be a creative person. A person with predominant pingala nadi is more head centered and very rational in approach.</p>
<p>The <em>ida</em> predominant person is very emotional in approach. To discover Self realization we need to have a balanced <em>ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> -- well developed in head and heart -- only then the well developed philosopher in us comes out. The same message is conveyed in <em>Mahanarayana Upanshad</em> as <em>Hrida maneesha manasabhi klipto ye yenam vidura amrutaste bhavanti </em><span class="dev">(हृदा मनीषा मनसाऽभिक्लृप्तो य एनं विदुरमृतास्ते भवन्ति ।)</span>- heart and head (bhakti and jnana) and vairagya will lead to immortality.</p>
<p>We need to be <em>Ardha Naareeswara</em> - half male and half female personality for realization of God. Realization does not happen to one who is only either a head or a heart centered person.</p>
<p>Breathing through alternate nostrils activates the left and right brains. <em>Pranayama</em> activates not only <em>ida</em>, <em>pingala</em> and <em>sushumna nadis</em> but also activates the energy centres (chakras) in the body.</p>
<p>There are 8.4 million asanas of which 84 are important. Out of those 84 asanas 4 asanas are important. They are siddasana, padmasana, bhadrasana and simhasana.</p>

<p>The following are some of the different <em>Pranayama</em> techniques mentioned in Hata Yoga Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita. The postures recommended for practice are <em>Siddasana</em>, <em>Padmasana</em>, <em>Ardha Padmasan</em>a and <em>Vajrasana</em>. Pictures 18 to 21b show these postures. It is highly recommended to learn the pranayama under an adept teacher to avoid any side effects.</p>
<p><em>Hata Yoga Pradipika </em>says that <em>siddasana </em>is best among the asana as it purifies all 72,000 nadis. (HYP, 1-38, 39)</p>

<p>There is no asana like the <em>siddasana, </em>no kumbhaka like <em>kevala</em>, no mudra like <em>khechari </em>and no laya (absorption) like <em>nada</em>. (HYP, 1-43)</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">1.</span> Nadi Shodana Pranayama</h2>
<p><img src="images/045.jpg" alt="image" /><strong>Meaning:</strong><br /><em>Shodana</em> means purifying. Nadi Shodana <em>Pranayama</em> is the technique of purifying the nadis.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/034.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption>Picture 22:Nadi shodana Pranayama</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><img src="images/046.jpg" alt="image" /><strong> Benefits: </strong><br /> Purifies the nadis. As nadis are purified, the energy level in the body increases and the breathing deepens. When the nadis are cleansed, we are able to hear the <em>anahata</em> sound (inner sound). This harmonises the blood pressure which in turn relaxes the mind. The relaxed mind expands and intuition dawns in an expanded mind. This leads to the opening up of <em>Vijnanamaya kosha.</em> In <em>Vijananmaya kosha</em> intuition starts working and we get flashes of inspiration which leads us to the <em>anandamaya kosha.</em> When the mind is expanded we are able to tap into our bliss within.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Pranayama for hot and cold days:</h2>
<p>Yogis use the pranayama techniques to keep themselves cool on the hot days and warm during the cold days. This will enable them to turn on the internal air conditioner. By doing the <em>Chandra loma</em> pranayama, i.e. inhaling through the left nostril and exhaling through the right, <em>ida nadi gets </em>activated, generating a cooling effect on the body.</p>
<p>By doing the <em>Surya loma</em> pranayama, ie. Inhaling through the right nostril and exhaling through the left, <em>pingala nadi gets </em>activated and this has a heating effect on the body.</p>
<p>Body has its own thermostat. Generally, the <em>ida nadi</em> is active for about 2-3 hours and then it switches over to the <em>pingala nadi</em> for next 2-3 hours. Sometime, the body thermostat stops working and only ida or pigala nadi will be active for a long period of time. This results in one feeling cold or hot for a long period of time. We can overcome this problem by the following pranayama techniques.</p>

<p>To know the <em>Upanishads </em>(higher knowledge), one has to be initiated into <em>upanayana</em> (opening the inner eye) by a <em>upadyaya</em> (a competent teacher). To understand the Upanishad one has to revel in higher things (upavasa).</p>
<p>This pranayama mantra comes in Mahanarayana Upanishad which is a part of Taitareya Upanishad and it is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Om bhuhu Om bhuvaha Om Suvaha Om Mahaha Om Janaha Om Tapaha Om Satyam Om Tat Savitur Vareyanm Bhargo Dhevasya Dhimahi Dhiyoyonah Parchodayat, Om apo jyoti raso amrutam Brahma bhurbhuvaswarom</em> <span class="dev">(ॐ भूः ॐ भुवः ॐ सुवः ॐ महः ॐ जनः ॐ तपः ॐ सत्यं ॐ तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् । ॐ आपो ज्योती रसोऽमृतं ब्रह्म भूर्भुवःस्वरोम् ।।)</span></p>
<p>This mantra has 10 Omkaras, talks about seven higher levels of existence, bhu, buva, swaha, mahaha, janaha, Tapaha and satya lokas, one Gayatri Mantra and at the end a prayer to the all-pervading Lord to protect our sadhana.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">14.</span>So Ham Pranayama</h2>
<p><img src="images/045.jpg" alt="image" /><strong>Meaning:</strong>Every day, every one of us chant the Hamsa mantra 21600 times approximately (one per inhalation and exhalation). Hamsa is swan. The Prana principle in us is called Hamsa and Prana is doing this to invoke the Parama Hamsa -- Supreme Lord in us.</p>
<p>Hamsa has two words Ham and Sa. In a reverse order this becomes So Ham. So means Saha which means That, Absolute, Supreme Lord. Aham means individual soul. I am aham for myself. You are aham for yourself. But the Supreme Lord is the aham for everyone. Aham means aheya -- we can exist giving up. Supreme Lord is aheaya (the inseparable principle) for everyone.</p>
<p>When we go deep in the sadhana (practice) we realise how insignificant we are. So Ham means the individual soul cannot exist without Him (Supreme Lord). So Ham means the individual and the Supreme Lord co-exist together. Supreme Lord is the closest friend of the individual soul -- jiva. This is mentioned in the Mundaka Upanishad as dwa suparna sayuja sakhaya <span class="dev">(द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया)</span></p>
<p>So means one who pervades in the macrocosm (Brahmanda). Aham means one who is within the microcosm (pindanda). We are invoking the all-pervading Lord through So Ham Pranayama.</p>
<p><img src="images/046.jpg" alt="image" /><strong> Benefits: </strong><br /> Calms the mind. Takes the mind deeper into meditation. Helps in awaking the kundalini.</p>
<p><img src="images/047.jpg" alt="image" /><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring your hands into chin mudra or ananata prajna mudra or purna prajna mudra</li>
<li>When you inhale mentally say So and when you exhale mentally say Ham</li>
<li>Be aware of your breathing. Increase the rate of inhalation and exhalation like bastrika</li>
<li>Repeat for 2-5 minutes and relax.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/048.jpg" alt="image" /><strong>Caution:</strong><br /> Do it under the guidance of a teacher.</p>
