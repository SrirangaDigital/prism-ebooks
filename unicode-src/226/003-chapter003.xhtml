<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Mudra and Bandha</h1>
<p>Mudra means symbol. Mudra means insignia. Mudra means commitment. Samudra means full commitment. That is why God is called as Samudra - as He has full commitment in everything and never does anything half-heartedly.</p>
<p>According to Gheranda Samhita, Mudras and Bandhas are done to steady the body. Mudras and Bandhas help in preventing the dissipation of energy, and help in redirecting the energy. Bandhas are the lock and mudras are the lock over a lock.</p>
<p>Hata Yoga Pradipika talks about Maha Mudra, Maha Bandha, Maha Vedha, Jalandhar Bandha, Uddyan Bandha, Moola Bandha, Viparta Karini Mudra, Khechari Mudra, Aswini Mudra, Vrajoli Mudra, Shambhavi Mudra and Shan Mukhi Mudra.</p>
<p><em>Ha</em> means sun, <em>Ta</em> means moon. The seat of moon centre is the <em>Sahasrara chakra</em>,  and the seat of sun system is the  <em>manipura  chakra</em> at the navel. Our active life continues as long as the nectar remains in the  <em>sahasrara chakra</em>  at the crown. Just like pressing the accelerator in the car draws more fuel, when we breathe rapidly, we draw more nectar from the <em>sahasrara chakra</em> which flows into the <em>manipura chakra</em> where it gets consumed. Bandhas like Jalandhara bandha, Kriyas like Vasudeva Kriya, Viparita Karani, asanas such as Shirasasana, Sarvangasana, Vrischikasana etc. reduce the consumption of the nectar (<em>amruta</em>) at <em>Manipura chakra</em>  and preserve the body's vitality.</p>
<p>By manipulating our prana or vital energy, we can direct it towards better health, well being and personal transformation.</p>
<p>Mudra is defined as  <em>Mudham Dadaati Devaanam Dravayasya Asuraarapi</em>  -- ‘That by which the divine beings get happiness and the negative forces and diseases are driven away’. Mudras are used in <em>Tantra puja</em>.</p>
<p>Mudras are classified in to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kaya Mudra</strong> <em>(mudra through body- Viparitakarani, Yoga mudra, Manduki Mudra etc)</em></li>
<li><strong>Mana Mudra </strong> <em>(mudra through the senses on the face- using lips, eyes, nose, ear, tongue -- Shambhavi, Kaki, Akashi, Nasika Dristi, Shanmukhi, Khechari)</em></li>
<li><strong>Bandha</strong> <em>(Jaalandhar, Uddiyan, Moola and Maha)</em></li>
<li><strong>Adhara Mudra </strong> <em>(supporting mudras - Aswini, Vrajoli etc)</em></li>
<li><strong>Hasta Mudra</strong> <em>(mudras through hands - balance the</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Mahabhootas</em> like fire, water, air, earth and ether elements and</li>
<li><em>Tanmaatras</em> like taste, touch, smell and sound in the body and</li>
<li><em>Doshas</em> in the body like <em>kapha</em> (phlegm), <em>pitta</em> (fire) and <em>vata</em> (air).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hasta Mudra (hand mudra)</h2>
<p><strong>Dhanvantari Mantra (Healing mantra):</strong></p> 
<p class="verse"><em>Om Ayam me hasto Bhagavan ayam me bhagavattaraha</em> <br /> <em>Ayam me viswa bheshajaha ayam Shivabhi marshanaha</em></p>
<p class="verse"><span class="dev">ॐ अयं मे हस्तो भगवानयं मे भगवत्तरः । अयं मे विश्ववेदसोऽयं शिवाऽऽभिमर्शनः ।</span></p>
<p><strong>The broad meaning of this mantra:</strong> “The Supreme Lord resides in my palms as the greatest healer. All the medicinal herbs of this world are in my palms. By His Grace, through these palms I heal myself and I will be an instrument in healing others.”</p>
<p>The body is made up of 5 elements -- Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. When these five elements are not in balance we get various physical and psychological ailments. The energy from the body radiates out mainly through the tip of the nose, lips, fingertips and toes. When the thumb is brought in contact with the other fingers, energy is directed back to vitalize various parts of our body. This is called a <em>circuit bypass</em>. Mudras and bandhas go hand in hand. Bandhas help in locking in the energy, whereas mudras help in redirecting the energy.</p>
<p>Mudras are the expression of our inner feeling. In the Tantra shastra, Mudra is defined as <em>‘the one which gives happiness.’</em> Mudras form a part of yoga and are together referred to as <em>Yoga Mudra</em>. Mudras done using hands are called <em>Hasta Mudra</em>. Indian classical dances such as <em>Bharata Natyam, Yakshagana, Mohini Aattam, Kathakali, Kuchupudi, Oddissi</em> make use of mudras to express their art forms. In the temples deities show different mudras. Of those the most well-known mudra is the <em>abhaya</em> mudra (reassuring mudra). In Tirupathi, Balaji’s statue depicts that ‘if you surrender to my feet, your problems are knee deep - and you can easily walk through them.’</p>
<p>The five fingers represent the five elements (tatvas):</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb: Fire  (<em>agni</em>) </li>
<li>Index Finger: Air  (<em>vayu</em>) </li>
<li>Middle finger: Space  (<em>akasha</em>) </li>
<li>Ring Finger: Earth  (<em>pritvi</em>) </li>
<li>Small finger: Water  (<em>jala</em>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Fire is the most important of the five elements. When the fire element becomes weak in the body, various ailments come to the body. Through the practice of Mudras the fire element (thumb) is joined with the other elements (other fingers) to vitalize those elements also.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/094.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption>Picture 70: Viparitakarini Mudra</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Meaning:</strong><br /> <em>Viparitakarini</em> is an inverted posture. In fact <em>Shirasasana</em> and <em>Sarvangasana</em> are also called  <em>Viparitakarini</em>. The nectar (<em>amruta</em>)  is continuously trickling down from the moon center at the <em>sahasrara chakra</em> and gets consumed in the sun centre at the <em>manipura chakra</em>. The vitality in the body exists as long as the nectar is there in the moon centre. Once the nectar gets depleted, old age sets in. This mudra revitalizes the moon centre. The same is mentioned in Bhagawat Gita wherein Shri Krishna says: <em>pusnami causadhih sarvah somo bhutva rasatmakah</em> <span class="dev">(पुष्णामि चौषधीः सर्वाः सोमो भूत्वा रसात्मकः) </span> B.G. 15.13 - I become <em>Amruta</em> (nectar) in the moon and nourish all living beings.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Benefits:</strong><br /> This posture is similar to <em>Sarvangasana</em> except that the throat muscles are not constricted in this mudra. In this mudra, the sun centre which is located at <em>manipura chakra</em>,  goes above the moon centre which is located at the head. Moon is called <em>soma</em>.  <em>Soma</em>  means Shiva. <em>Soma</em>  means <em>Mukya Prana</em>. Prana level in the body increases. The digestive fire gets ignited. This energises the mind, slows down the ageing process, slows down greying of hair, removes wrinkles on the face and increases the heart volume. It decompresses the internal organs, rehydrates the discs, slows down the heart rate, oxygenates the blood and improves the Digestion.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Viparitakarani we are reversing the position of sun and moon centres so that the sun centre goes higher than moon and starts energizing the moon centre. </li>
<li>Lie down on your back and keep your hands beside the body.</li>
<li>With inhalation raise both feet above the ground. </li>
<li>Raise your waist up and support the back on your hands with the elbows on the ground. </li>
<li>Bring your toes in line with your eyes.</li>
<li>Do not throttle your neck muscles or apply any pressure on the neck muscles. </li>
<li>Breathe normally and hold this position for 1 minute and gradually increase the duration. </li>
<li>With exhalation slowly come down and relax. Refer to picture 70.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<p>People suffering from blood pressure, glaucoma, hernias, cardiovascular disease, cervical spondylitis, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, and kidney problems should not practice headstand. Those suffering from neck injuries should perform this kriya under supervision.</p>

<p>There is a mantra in Veda which says <em>Om Vam Vartu mandala  madyasta sweta varno Varunantargata Shri Vasudeva mat  sharramastam Amruta Vristya Plavayatu</em> (<span class="dev">ॐ वं वर्तुलमण्डलमध्यस्थः श्वेतवर्णः वरुणान्तर्गतश्रीवासुदेवः मच्छरीरं अमृतवृष्ट्या आप्लावयतु ।।)</span> -- In the crown centre amidst of the white hue the indrewller of  <em>Varuna</em> may the Lord <em>Shri Vasudeva</em> nourish all the limbs of the body with <em>amruta</em> (nectar).</p>
<p>Moon centre in <em>Sahsrara chakra</em> (crown chakra) produces <em>Amruta</em> (soma rasa -- nectar). It gets wasted when it falls and gets consumed in the sun centre (<em>Manipurs chakra</em>).</p>
<p>In the mouth, there are two dangling bits -- one is tongue and another is inner tongue called <em>uvula</em>. Uvula looks like an udder. We are using the tongue to milk the <em>amruta</em> (nectar).</p>
<ul>
<li>Hata Yoga Pradipika says One should saturate the body from head to foot with nectar (flowing from moon). Then he becomes endowed with excellent body, great strength and valor. - khechari is explained in 4-53</li>
<li>If the <em>sushumna</em> is stopped without the suspension of prana, it perfects the khechari. By frequent practice of kechar, unmani follows. 4-47</li>
<li>One should practice khechari until one goes in to yoga Samadhi. In this sleep, time (death) does not exist 4-49</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Benefits:</strong><br /> By the practice of this mudra the yogi becomes free from fainting, hunger, thirst and laziness. He or she becomes free from diseases, decay, old age and death. This mudra makes one an <em>urdhvaretas</em> (one in whom the energy flows upward). As the body of the yogi is filled with nectar, he will have resistance even to virulent poison. You feel the sweetness in the throat and bliss increases. This mudra gives <em>siddhis</em>  (powers) to Yogis. This mudra helps in transcending the mind called <em>unmani bhava</em>. Khechari is the best of all mudras.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Process: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit in Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha Padmasana or Vajrasana.</li>
<li>If you cannot sit on the floor you can sit on a chair.</li>
<li>Keep your body, head and neck in one line.</li>
<li>Hold the chin up. </li>
<li>Bring the thumb and index finger together in chin mudra on your knees. </li>
<li>Inhale and raise your tongue up and take it as back as you can. </li>
<li>Stretch your neck up as back as you can as if you are looking at the ceiling in to <em>Akashi Mudra</em>.</li>
<li>Stretch your tongue further back so as to touch the root of the upper palate to catch the nectar trickling from the moon centre. </li>
<li>Feel the stretch in the lower tendon of the tongue.</li>
<li>This slows down the breathing.</li>
<li>Remain here for as long as you can. Exhale and relax. Refer to pictures 71 and 72.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Caution:</strong><br /> People with neck injury should do this mudra with caution.</p>

<figcaption>Picture 73 :Shambhavi Mudra</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Meaning:</strong><br /> <em>Gheranda Samhita</em> says, <em>vedas</em> and <em>puranas</em> are like public women because they have been abused by misunderstanding them. Treat the Shambhavi like a lady from a respectable family.</p>
<p><em>Hata Yoga Pradipika</em> says Shambhavi mudra consists of fixing the mind internally in the heart centre and fixing the eyes externally between the eye brow centre without blinking. When the yogi remains with mind turned within and when breathing has become slow and when the gaze is fixed without blinking, when although eyes are open he or she does not grasp the object, he is said to be in  <em>Shabhavi mudra</em>. By the grace of Guru, one attains the state of Shambhu which is resplendent which is beyond what is heard and what is mentioned in the scriptures. 4-36, 37</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Benefits:</strong><br /> This awakens the intuition faculty and deepens meditation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the gaze between the eyebrows and feel the energy rising in the <a>ajna chakra</a>. Direct the gaze towards the light by raising the eyebrows a little upwards. This helps the yogi to transcend the mind  (<a>unmani</a>). </li>
