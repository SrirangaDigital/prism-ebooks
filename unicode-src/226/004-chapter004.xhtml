			<p class="text-center">For treatment: Pressure is to be applied on and around these points of the soles</p>
			<p>Acu means needle. Acupressure means an art of treating disease by applying pressure with oneâ€™s thumb or using blunt objects. There are various acupressure points in the palms and feet soles. Applying pressure on these points helps in energising the internal organs. Every day by pressing these points you will be able to check the health of your internal organs. Experience of pain while pressing any point indicates some problem with the associated organ. Everyday press the various points in the palms and feet sole for quick diagnosis of your body. If pain persists for few days, you can consult the doctor.</p>
			<p>By pressing the middle part of the fore arm as shown in the picture, energy level in the body can be increased and dissipation of energy can be prevented. This is beneficial especially for elderly people.</p>

			<p>Diseases come to the body when the energy in the nadis does not flow properly. When the energy blocks are removed, body becomes disease free. Star Jumps when done along-with clapping is a very simple and effective technique for clearing energy blocks and energising all parts of the body.</p>
