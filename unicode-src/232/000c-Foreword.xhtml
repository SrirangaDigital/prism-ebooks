		<p>If there is a historical figure that remains ever present in modern day life, especially for an engineer, scientist or mathematician, it is Isaac Newton. So much that we teach and learn, and so many of the things around us, depend upon the insight that Newton shared with the world in his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. As one of the lucky few who have experienced weightlessness in Earth orbit, I was keenly aware that my entire trip was an expression of Newton’s Laws. The challenge of spaceflight and the ingenuity that makes it possible are completely based in the physics and mathematics that Newton discovered and invented. During the last spacewalk to build the International Space Station, I found myself above the highest point on the structure looking down on the incredible feat of engineering and the entire Earth below. Newton famously once said, “if I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulder of giants.” At this moment, I distinctly recall thinking of Newton, and that this was “floating on the shoulders of giants.” It’s quite astonishing how much our world today is shaped by the insights of one man who lived three centuries ago.</p>
		<p>While many biographies have been written about Newton. The allure to rediscover Newton and his times is an indication of the magnificent persona that he was. In this book, Sydney Srinivas (at the University of Sydney we call him Srin) captures a seminal period in human history, when the idea of science was born as a branch of study separate from philosophy and alchemy. Newton stands out for being a pioneer in the experimental method of studying science, which is akin to the scientific method used to this day!</p>
		<p>Srin’s biography of Newton is concise yet comprehensive and very enjoyable to read. The book is divided into two sections: The Life and Times of Newton, and Newton’s Scientific Discoveries. This approach works very well for several reasons: The first part weaves together the fascinating story of Newton’s life and times, and it does so without being distracted by theoretical concepts or scientific explanations. The reader can enjoy the evolution of the person, Isaac Newton, as an individual in society and as a scientist. The second part gives a wonderful account of Newton’s most important scientific discoveries, theories, laws and mathematical insights. Like me, many engineers and scientists will be tempted to skip ahead and indulge in this terrific summary with just the right level of math to explain the concepts clearly, while keeping it accessible to the largest possible audience.</p>
		<p>The author’s idea is not to write the most authoritative biography of Newton but to write one that gives a holistic insight into the complex human mind that was at once genius, larger than life and yet, very human, with all its frailties and idiosyncrasies. As a biographer, Srin is clearly enamored by Newton and passionate in his writing. He also has the objectivity to view the subject from a distance and examine Newton from multiple perspectives. No doubt that Srin’s account of Newton’s life and contributions will be thoroughly enjoyed by countless readers, who will find themselves propelled to explore and discover more about Newton’s scientific contributions.</p>
