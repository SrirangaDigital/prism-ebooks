		<p>Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth is a small village in the Lincolnshire County, about 150 kilometers to the North of London. Grantham, the nearest town is about 12 kilometers away (Fig. 1). One among the numerous villages that raised sheep, none would have guessed in the mid 17th century that it would stand out on the world map one day. Here lived the Newton family, whose main occupation was farming. Education was way below on the priority list. Isaac Newton’s father, also called Isaac, signed his will ‘<em>XXX’!</em> One of his ancestors had bought a big house called Woolsthorpe Manor in the village (Fig. 2). This was the house where Isaac Newton, the scientist, was born. Built of gray limestone it is a massive building, which has been preserved and is now a museum.</p>

		<p>Newton Senior was married to Hannah Ayscough who came from a family where the men were educated. Perhaps, Newton Jr. owed his superior intellect and inclination to education to his mother’s family. It is a pity that Newton Sr. died in October 1642, only six months after his marriage. He was 36 and was said to be sick of body though mentally fit. However, Hannah was already pregnant. Not much is known about him except that he was, ‘wild, extravagant and weak’.</p>
		<p>Isaac Newton was born a premature baby, on Christmas Day, 1642. It is a coincidence that Galileo Galilei, Italian astronomer and physicist, aged 80 died the same year. A similar coincidence in science history is the birth of Albert Einstein in the year 1879, which also marked the death of James Clerk Maxwell, Scottish mathematical physicist. Both Newton and Einstein continued the scientific relay race after receiving the baton from Galileo and Maxwell respectively.</p>
		<p>Infant Isaac was tiny; very few expected that he would survive. A bolster was needed to keep his head over his shoulder. People joked that the infant could be placed within a quart pot, which holds about a litre and half of water. It is said that two women were sent by his mother to fetch medicine or a midwife from a neighbouring village. The two started no doubt, but on their way, sat down by the roadside, engrossed in some interesting conversation. They assumed the infant would not survive and hence the medicine or midwife would be of no use. Little did they know that the infant would become a world-famous scientist! Hannah too did not believe that the infant would survive. She waited for a week until January 1, 1643 before christening him.</p>
		<p>It turns out that Isaac was a rich child. His father had left a sizable property consisting of more than £450, 234 sheep, 46 head of cattle and goats and other goods worth £ 140, apart from the huge ancestral house. In contrast, an average farmer of those days would have owned about £ 100 and 40 sheep.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Hannah Remarries</span></h2>
			<p>Hannah was 30 years old when Isaac was born. She attracted the attention of Reverend Barnabas Smith, the rector in North Witham. He was a wealthy 63-year-old widower of six months. The two married in 1646 and Hannah moved to North Witham to be with her new husband. Barnabas insisted that Isaac should not join the couple. Hannah had to leave Isaac in Woolsthorpe Manor. Hannah’s mother, <em>Margery </em>Ayscough was brought in to take care of him. As a marriage deal, Hannah demanded and obtained from Smith a sizeable land that added to her wealth.</p>
			<p>Barnabas was an Oxford graduate with B.A. and M.A. degrees and he was inclined towards academics and education. He had a large notebook of more than 1000 pages, in which he made extensive notes. A book was a valuable possession in those days when paper was very expensive. Isaac called it the ‘Waste Book’ in view of the number of blank pages in it. Barnabas owned a library of about 200 books mostly on theology. Isaac inherited all of these.</p>
			<p>His mother’s remarriage had a devastating effect on Isaac. Historians claim that he was deeply traumatized by his separation from his mother and dislike towards his stepfather. Some of Isaac’s writings in his note-books give us a glimpse into his emotional turmoil. One of the entries reads – <em>Brother. Bastard … Benjamite … Father. Fornicator</em>. Later in 1662, Isaac listed some of the sins (see Appendix B for List of Sins) he committed – <em>Making pies on Sunday nights. Threatening my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them. </em>Newton had no affectionate recollections of his grandmother. In fact, her death went almost unnoticed. Joel Levy observes, “As an adult Newton was withdrawn, moody, intense and prone to fits of rage and long harboured grudges.”</p>
			<p>Barnabas Smith did not live for too long after his marriage to Hannah; he died in 1653 at 71. Consequently, Hannah acquired more wealth, becoming one of the richest in the area. She had three children from Smith – Mary, Benjamin and Hannah. That his step brother’s name was Benjamin explains what Isaac wrote about his brother (<em>Brother. Bastard … Benjamite … Father)</em>. Widowed again, Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe Manor with her three new children. It is difficult to judge whether Isaac welcomed this reunion with his mother. Historians believe he was unhappy. There is a reference to <em>punching his sister</em> in his list of sins (see Appendix B for list of sins). However, he lived with his half-brother and sisters only for two years. He was admitted to a school in Grantham and he moved away.</p>
			<p>There are no records of Isaac’s early education. The only known facts are that he was sent to day schools in neighbouring villages of Skillington and Stoke. Many of Isaac’s aunts, uncles and cousins lived in villages around Woolsthorpe. But he remained aloof and did not develop intimacy with any of them. As the famous biographer, Richard Westfall notes, “The lonely boyhood was the first chapter in a long career of isolation.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">At Kings School in Grantham</span></h2>
			<p>In 1655, Isaac had turned 12 and was deemed to be of the right age to go to a grammar school. He was sent to King’s School in Grantham, also called Free Grammar School of Edward VI. Established some 300 years before Newton, it was about 11 <em>km</em> from Woolsthorpe. The school was a single room that housed 80 students (Fig. 3) and was headed by Henry Stokes, a Cambridge alumnus. Latin and Greek were part of the curriculum at the grammar school. Mathematics was hardly taught and yet Isaac invented calculus within four years of leaving this school!</p>
			<p>Stokes apparently introduced students to simple arithmetic calculations that would be of use to a farmer, such as measurement of areas, volumes, surveying etc. The study of the Bible was mandatory. The many books on theology in Barnabas Smith’s library may have kindled his interest in theology and the Bible. With the help of his teacher, Isaac read books that were available in the church near his school. We will see later that Newton was as interested in theology as in natural philosophy.</p>

			<p>As it was difficult for Isaac to commute from Woolsthorpe to Grantham every day, he lodged in the house of John Clark, who owned an apothecary business on the main street of Grantham (Fig. 4). Clark had no children of his own; his wife had two sons, Arthur and Edward, and a daughter, Catherine Storer by a previous marriage. Isaac apparently did not get along with her boys either.</p>
			<p>William Stuckeley, Isaac’s friend at school who wrote Isaac’s memoirs later in life, points out that Isaac preferred the company of girls. He showed some affection towards Catherine Storer, though short-lived and forgotten. In fact, this was possibly the only romance Isaac Newton ever developed in his life. One boyish mischief that Isaac enjoyed was stealing cherry cobs, bread and butter from Edward and Arthur. This act too, makes it to his list of sins (see Appendix B for List of Sins).</p>
			<p>To quote Westfall, Isaac remained ‘...<em>a sober, silent, thinking lad who never was known; scarce to play with boys abroad’</em>. To start with, Isaac was not considered a bright boy. He ranked lowest in a class of 80. Although, Isaac appeared dim-witted initially, his classmates began to recognize his superior intelligence over course of time, which resulted in hatred rather than admiration.</p>

			</figure>
				<p>A very interesting incident took place one day. On his way to school, a boy, possibly Arthur Storer, kicked Isaac in the belly. Isaac mustered all his courage and challenged the boy to a duel after class. A well-arranged fight took place in the churchyard opposite the school in Grantham. It is said that Isaac beat the boy until he declared that he would fight no more. Isaac pulled him by the ear and thrust his face against the side of the church. This enmity however was limited to childhood. In later life, Arthur collaborated with Newton in his astronomical ventures and Edward Storer became a tenant in Woolsthorpe Manor.</p>
				<p>This duel was a turning point in Isaac’s life. He resolved to beat academically the boy whom he had beaten in the duel. In fact, he defeated not just that boy but the entire school. He stood first. As a celebration, he etched his name on every bench in the school. An etching of his signature on the window remains to date (Fig. 5).</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Making Gadgets</span></h2>
				<p>Isaac had an extraordinary interest and skill in mechanical work. He was a very good carpenter and liked fabricating small gadgets. He spent all his pocket money on buying saws, chisels, hammers and other such tools. Fabricating something in his room was more rewarding than the fun and frolic of playing with other boys. He made a dollhouse with furniture for Catherine Storer and built himself a four-wheeled cart in which he could sit and propel himself.</p>
				<p>Isaac was a keen observer. He was fascinated by mechanical structures. A windmill was under construction in Grantham (Fig. 6). The villagers who had only seen water mills until then were excited at the sight of this new machine. While they treated it as an exciting novelty, Isaac observed it very carefully.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/0008.jpg" alt="image" />
					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 6</span> Wind Mill near Grantham</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>He built a model whose blades turned with the help of sails. He amused himself into thinking, ‘why not power it with a mouse rather than wind?’ He built a treadmill and made a mouse run on it for a cob of corn. The motion of the mouse on the treadmill operated the windmill. Newton’s model amused the villagers more than the big windmill!</p>
				<p>A kite soaring in the sky is the ultimate fascination for any child. Isaac was no exception. His curiosity and interest got the better of him and he comprehended the functions of the various parts of a kite, the sail, the spine, the tail and so on. He determined the correct proportions of these various parts and the exact points to attach the strings. He lit a lantern and joined it to one of his kites. The villagers were amazed to see a flying lantern. He made lanterns out of crimped paper and carried them in his pocket. He also made several wooden clocks, one of them powered by trickling water.</p>
				<p>Isaac’s inspiration and reference for his art came from a book entitled <em>The Mysteries of Nature and Art </em>by John Bate, a Welsh theologian and philosopher of the 15th century (Fig. 7). This book, divided into four parts dealt with water works, fireworks, drawing, colouring, painting and engraving, and a description of diverse experiments. His brilliance and originality in building such contrivances stood him apart from other children of his age. Even while he played with other boys he must have exercised his mind with questions about gadgets. Playing for the sake of play alone was a futile activity for him. His classmates found him cunning enough to exploit friendship for gain.</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>Isaac was not content with borrowed knowledge from books. He wanted to see and experience everything for himself. As a sixteen year old, he contemplated and carried out an experiment to measure the speed of wind. It was a stormy day; he jumped with the wind and then against the wind. He compared his leaps with the ones he had made on a calm day. He determined that the storm was ‘a foot stronger’. Of course, we may dismiss such an experiment, but we have to bear in mind that he was only a young lad and yet he had thought of conducting an experiment to ascertain knowledge.</p>
				<p>The sun-dial (Fig. 8) was another contraption that attracted Isaac when he was only nine years old. The one in the Colsterworth church is said to be the handiwork of Isaac. He placed many dials in Clark’s house. These would show time accurately to a quarter of an hour. His expertise was such that by looking at the dial and the shadow he could tell even the day of the month. Not to mention, the villagers and his own family consulted his dials. Even in his later years, Newton looked at shadows to tell the time. One of the dials that he placed in Woolsthorpe Manor is now in the possession of the Royal Society in London (Fig. 9).</p>

				</figure>
				<p>He also had a natural flair for drawing and sketching. He filled his room walls in Clark’s house with charcoal sketches of birds, beasts, men, ships and plants. Portraits of John Donne, Charles I and schoolmaster Stokes also adorned the walls. Geometry found its place too. Lines, triangles and circles were etched on the wall. These were clear indications of the direction in which Newton’s imagination would run.</p>
				<p>Too much involvement in such activity made Isaac neglect other subjects and he fell behind in class. Stokes, the schoolmaster, had to caution him. After that, Isaac picked up his studies and again stood first.</p>
				<p>Isaac, thirteen now, took extensive notes in a book. In it are found entries related to drawing, catching birds, making inks of different colours etc. Scholars like Westfall have noted that the notebook contains information about contraptions such as windmills and sundials, and about colour, light and stargazing. This habit remained with him throughout his life. He copied whatever he read. It is said that he could not read anything without a pen and paper!</p>
				<p><em>Organising</em> and <em>categorising</em> information were two important skills that Isaac developed from his school days. He would gather information by reading and observation. He would then organize the data, ask questions about it, record it neatly in his notebook, and finally set forth to seek answers in the style of a true rationalist.</p>
				<p>As we know, Isaac was boarding at John Clark’s house. Clark was a practicing apothecary and his laboratory was right below his house. Isaac, who spent time at the apothecary, acquainted himself with chemicals, solutions, lotions, powders and such. The knowledge he thus obtained may not have been directly useful for his future alchemical endeavors, but he did acquire the art of mixing chemicals and handling them. It was like an apprenticeship.</p>
				<p>Isaac wrote in one of his notebooks, called the Latin Exercise Book, which he purchased for two and a half pence - <em>A little fellow; my poore help; He is paile; There is no room for me to sit; In the top of the house - in the bottom of hell; What imployment is he fit for? What is hee good for? I will make an end. I cannot but weepe. I know not what to doe. </em>He did not forget to write <em>Isaacus Newton hunc librum possidet</em> (translated as - Isaac Newton owns this book).</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Back to the Farm</span></h2>
				<p>In 1659, when Isaac was seventeen years of age, his mother Hannah thought he should return home and manage the estate. Learning in a school was not necessary in her opinion. There were things more urgent at home that required his attention. From books, Stokes and school, Isaac returned to the family farm to be with sheep, cattle and pigs.</p>
				<p>A servant was appointed to help Isaac and teach him his new responsibilities. This change was disastrous for Newton. Isaac would be sent to watch the sheep. He would leave the sheep to fend for themselves and would engage in building a water wheel or a dam across the brook. He would never notice a broken fence. The sheep would stray into the neighbouring farm and feed on the corn. It was for Hannah to make good the losses. It has been recorded, for example, that on October 28, 1659, Newton was fined 3s 4d.</p>
				<p>A distraught mother tried Isaac at trading. He was sent with a servant to a market to sell some family produce and procure something for the house. Isaac found a way out. He bribed the servant and made him do all the transactions while he spent his time with a book or a gadget. If the market took place in Grantham, it was to Isaac’s advantage. He could escape to Clark’s house or the school. Heaps of books awaited him.</p>
				<p>Usually, Isaac went to such markets by horse. Once on his way back, like every other rider, he dismounted to climb a steep hill. When at the top of the hill, riders usually remounted the horse, but Isaac simply forgot to do so. Engrossed in some deep thought, he walked with the horse all the way home. On another occasion, it is said that the horse slipped his bridle and went home by itself. The servants at Woolsthorpe had a tough time with a lad who was not in the least interested in farming and so absent minded that he forgot to take his meals. They said in unison- <em>Isaac unfit for farm, fit only for varsity. </em>A glimpse into what Isaac felt about this life is evident from his list of sins - <em>Refusing to go to the close at my mother’s command, Falling out with the servants</em> and such (refer Appendix B for List of Sins).</p>
				<p>There were two people who understood the situation and were sympathetic of the young lad. One was Hannah’s brother Reverend William Ayscough and the other, schoolmaster Stokes. The two warned Hannah that any attempt to train Isaac in farming would fail. Watching sheep, herding cattle and shoveling dung were not tasks befitting his interests. He was bound to be a scholar. His talents were being wasted. He should be sent back to school. Stokes offered to waive the forty shilling fees and offered him boarding at his house (Apothecary John Clark had had enough of Isaac!). Hannah had to yield. Science had its way. In 1660, after nine months of ‘farming life’ in Woolsthorpe, Isaac returned to the grammar school in Grantham.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Back at School</span></h2>
				<p>The lion was back in his domain. Clark’s intention was to train Isaac for a university education. Isaac excelled. He exceeded the expectations of schoolmaster Stokes. When he completed school education at Grantham, schoolmaster Stokes stood Isaac in front of the assembly of boys and said, “Isaac is an example for you. You should all become like him.” As he spoke, tears rolled down his cheeks. Even the other boys broke into tears.</p>
