		<p>Isaac left Woolsthorpe Manor in 1662 and made his way to Cambridge to enroll himself in the university. This was a unanimous decision among his well-wishers, schoolmaster Stokes, Isaac’s Uncle William and apothecary Clark’s brother, Humphrey Babington. Each of them had some affiliation with Cambridge University, Trinity College in particular.</p>
		<p>The university was established by King Henry III about 400 years before. It was one of the most prestigious institutions in Europe, and remains so to this day. Trinity College (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11) had the unique distinction of nurturing 32 of the 96 Nobel Prize winners of Cambridge University by the year of 2015. The prominence of Cambridge is evident, when we consider the number of illustrious scientists who have been associated with it. Some of these men of distinction include: Francis Bacon (father of empiricism and scientific method), J. J. Thomson (discovered electron), Ernest Rutherford (nuclear physicist), Sir John Cockcroft (discovered neutron), James Clerk Maxwell (electromagnetic theorist), Ernest Walton (split the atom), Henry Cavendish (discovered hydrogen), Charles Darwin (Theory of Evolution), Alan Turing (pioneer of modern computer), Francis Crick and James Watson (discovered the DNA structure), Paul Dirac (Quantum Mechanics), John Herschel &#38; Sir Arthur Eddington (astronomers), Lord Kelvin (Thermodynamics), Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose (Radio Science) and Amartya Sen (Economics).</p>
		<p>To this list, we can add celebrated poets such as Tennyson and Byron, social scientists, economists, artists, politicians and prime ministers (six from Britain alone).</p>

		<p>Cambridge, a small town with a population of about 7000, of which 3000 were students and graduates, was the intellectual hub of 17th century England. River Cam that courses through the city is flanked by several colleges including Trinity.</p>
		<p>Isaac had to clear two levels of assessment to enroll at Cambridge. First, he had to gain admission to the college; for which he had to attend an interview to be conducted by the senior dean and head lecturer. Isaac cleared the interview effortlessly and was admitted to the college. However, admission to college did not entail admission into the university where he sought to obtain a degree. He had to go through the matriculation process. College merely meant a place like a hostel where scholars pursuing different disciplines stayed and boarded. There were many in Trinity College who did not seek a degree and therefore just boarded. Isaac successfully matriculated and officially entered the university by taking an oath and paying the required fees. His name found its place in the university’s matriculation book. In the words of Westfall – <em>For whatever reason, on 5 June 1661, the famousest college in the university, quite unaware, admitted its famousest student</em>. He remained here for several years to come.</p>
		<p>In preparation for his university life, he shopped for clothes, shoes, a lock for his desk, a quart bottle, ink, candles and a chamber pot. For his recreation, he bought a chessboard and became a member of the tennis club. Thus, sheep, cattle, pigs and dung vanished from his view. Now it was books and more books; scholars and scholarship.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Isaac - a Subsizar</span></h2>
			<p>At Cambridge, students were categorised as Fellow Commoners, Pensioners, Sizars and Subsizars. Fellow Commoners were wealthy people who enjoyed many privileges such as occupying the top of the table for meals. Pensioners were affluent. Below them in hierarchy were the sizars and subsizars, no better than second-class citizens and the college called them <em>scholars paupers, qui nominentur Sizatores</em>. Though they were ‘servants’ to others, there was a distinction between sizars and subsizars. Sizars served masters and fellows of the college while the subsizars served fellow students. Both sizars and subsizars did all the menial jobs such as cleaning, polishing shoes, combing the commoner’s hair, carrying wood to the heaters, fetching food from the buttery, even emptying the chamber pot. Isaac was a subsizar.</p>
			<p>Why did Isaac demote himself to such a low level? His mother was rich by all standards. She had an annual income of more than £700. But she allowed him only £10 per year while the college fees cost £10 to £15 a year. Perhaps she did not approve of Isaac studying in a university. Farming was her priority. There is also a belief that Isaac went to Trinity specifically to be Babington’s sizar. Isaac had an ulterior motive. The latter was in Trinity only four or five weeks in a year! This meant Isaac would get considerable time to study.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Intellectual Separation</span></h2>
			<p>Many factors distinguished Isaac from his peers at college. By comparison, he was far more intelligent than the rest. Although rich, his mother provided a very small allowance. He lived beyond his means. He bought and flaunted expensive clothes, lent money to pensioners, his bed maker and other colleagues. He was about a year older than the rest and that seemed enough reason to consider himself superior. He hardly had any friends. It appears that no one has ever said, “I was a classmate of Newton in Cambridge.” None of his classmates influenced him. The one exception is John Wickins, perhaps a pensioner, who joined Trinity in 1663. By then Isaac had completed 18 months of solitary existence in Trinity.</p>
			<p>Wickins’ son recalls his father explaining the circumstances under which the two met for the first time. John was not happy with his roommate and accidentally entered Isaac’s chambers where he sat solitary and dejected. They found that they shared the same dejection and decided to shake it off and become friends. Westfall opines that even this friendship was ambiguous. In his words - <em>The sober, silent, thinking lad of Grantham had become the solitary and dejected scholar of Cambridge</em>.</p>
			<p>In 1662, Isaac was struck by a moral crisis. He was plagued by a sense of guilt, doubt and self-denigration. He listed down ‘sins’ (see Appendix B for List of Sins) he had committed up to Whitsunday in 1662 and started another list for the ones he committed thereafter. He wrote his list in cipher using a system of shorthand. However, he seems to have discontinued his list very soon.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">A Tutor</span></h2>
			<p>Every student in the university was assigned a tutor who could be approached for help. Isaac’s tutor, Benjamin Pulleyn tutored a total of 57 students for a four-year term. Isaac, it seems, did not bother his tutor, for he never liked him. In fact, the latter was also happy to be left alone. Students were not allowed to visit the coffee clubs and the library of three thousand books at Cambridge unless accompanied by a tutor. It is not known whether Isaac was accompanied by his tutor Pulleyn on his visits to the library or whether he had found other ways to gain entry.</p>
