		<p>Even before Isaac entered the portals of Cambridge, he was abreast of contemporary developments in science and astronomy. Now that he had access to books, Isaac read with interest many great masters such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler and Robert Boyle (known for Boyle’s Law of Gases) and Sir Francis Bacon.</p>
		<p>A brief account of the contributions of these masters is given below. This will help us understand and analyze the context within which Newton operated, the influences that triggered his imagination, and the systems of knowledge that ripened the atmosphere for the birth of his genius.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) and Scholasticism</em></span></h2>
			<p>Cambridge in the 17th century was no longer an institution churning out graduates fit for state or religious duties. The curriculum was based on the scholasticism of the Middle Ages that advocated pure abstract reasoning as the only mode of acquiring knowledge. However, the modern concept of ascertaining facts through experimentation, observation and hypothesis had not yet entered the curriculum.</p>

			<p>Students were guided in the footsteps of the Greek philosopher Aristotle (Fig. 12). According to him, every substance was composed of four basic elements, namely earth, water, air and fire. Motion was the change in the properties of a substance, in terms of the ratio of the constituting elements. Almost every occurrence in the universe was a consequence of motion – child growing into man, water boiling in a pot, fruit ripening, a plant flowering, a stone falling. Besides, there was a causal factor for every motion. Nothing can move by itself. Every motion thus could be traced back to the first motion, the prime mover of which was, God. This theory had the approval of Christian theology and it is not hard to see why.</p>
			<p>In this philosophy, there was no room to explain the mechanism of motion, let alone measure and quantify it. According to the Greeks, mathematics was reserved for calculations concerning the heavens. It was not to be misused for earthly events such as the dropping of a stone or the flight of a bird.</p>
			<p>Isaac read Aristotle and made notes in Greek. Curiously, he wrote in the first few pages of the book. He left many blank pages and continued writing only at the end of the book. Did he intend to contemplate more on Aristotle and fill these pages later? No one knows.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Claudius Ptolemy (90 AD to 168 AD)</em></span></h2>
			<p>One of the earliest names that we come across in mathematics and astronomy is that of Claudius Ptolemy. He lived in Alexandria and wrote several treatises, which were important to European and Islamic science. His version of astronomy placed the earth at the centre of the universe around which the heaven moved.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543)</em></span></h2>
			<p>Science had to wait for more than a thousand years after Ptolemy, to stumble upon the truth about the universe. Nicolaus Copernicus (Fig. 13) was the game changer. Born in Poland, he studied at the universities of Cracow, Bologna, Padua and Ferrara, travelled all over Italy and other European countries with well-known astronomers. He challenged the geocentric conception of the universe and proposed the heliocentric system in which planets went around the sun in circular orbits. The Church felt threatened for its supremacy would collapse if the earth wasn’t the centre after all. It banned his second book <em>De Revolution ibus Orbium Coelestium. The minister in charge, Martin Luther declared, This fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside down.</em></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Johannes Kepler (1571 – 1630)</em></span></h2>
			<p>Born in Germany, Johannes Kepler (Fig. 14) was interested in science as a young boy. At the age of six, he watched a comet with his mother, and at nine, observed a lunar eclipse. He studied the theories of Copernicus and Ptolemy at the University of Tubingen and became a Copernican and upheld the heliocentric theory. He became an assistant to the well-known astronomer Tyco Brahe in Prague. Kepler disproved, with the help of mathematics, especially geometry, Copernicus’ proposition that planetary orbits were circular, and established that they were, in fact, elliptical; thus evolved the three Laws of Kepler. He also showed that moving planets swept out equal areas in equal times.</p>

			<p>Kepler’s Laws proved very helpful for Newton while he was working on his theories detailed in <em>Principia</em> and are outlined in Part 2 of the book.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642)</em></span></h2>
			<p>Galileo Galilei (Fig. 15), a great mathematician and astronomer was born in Pisa, Italy. Although he enrolled at the University of Pisa to study medicine, he soon switched to physics and astronomy. He built a telescope and viewed the heavens. Startling were his findings! Jupiter had satellites; the moon was not a poetic smooth surface; it had hills and valleys. He also supported Copernicus’ heliocentric theory for which, the Church placed him under house arrest. The same Church rendered an apology in 1992!</p>

			<p>Galileo gave mankind the Experimental Method and advocated experiments to prove or disprove a theory. He, for the first time, showed that mathematical expressions could explain many celestial phenomena. Newton continued in his footsteps and mathematically explained many natural events and occurrences. He conceived the concept of inertia proposing that objects have a tendency to remain in motion or remain stationary.</p>
			<p>Galileo performed his famous experiments supposedly at the inclined tower of Pisa and repeated them on an inclined plane. He accurately proposed that all objects fell down at the same rate. He ideated the concept of <em>free fall,</em> which Albert Einstein explored further, and named Galileo, <em>The Father of Physics</em>.</p>
			<p>Galileo explained his theories in two books - <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em> (Dialogo Sopra i Due Massimi Sistemi del Mondo) and <em>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences</em> (<em>Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, Intorno a due Nuove Scienze</em>). Newton had read the <em>Dialogue</em>, but not the <em>Discourses</em>.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>René Descartes (1596 – 1650)</em></span></h2>
			<p>Newton studied French philosopher René Descartes (Fig. 16) and investigated deeply into his theory. When Isaac entered the university, the mechanical theory of the universe as proposed by Descartes was in vogue. According to it, the universe was filled with an invisible substance called ether. Whenever an object moved, it disturbed the medium surrounding it by causing vortices. These vortices, in turn, transferred energy to objects nearby and made them move. By now, the word <em>gravity </em>was already in circulation among natural philosophers. Isaac tried to explain the motion of a cannon shot into air with the help of Descartes’ theory. His method of solving cubic equations did have some influence on Newton.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Sir Francis Bacon (1561 – 1626) </em></span></h2>
			<p>Sir Francis Bacon a philosopher, statesman and a scientist studied in Trinity College and took to a political career. He sowed the seeds of the Scientific Method further developed by Newton. He advocated the method of inductive reasoning to develop laws or theories from observations. Bacon stressed that it was necessary to engage with nature in order to understand it; not merely contemplate it like the Aristotelians.</p>
