		<p>It was as if science and mathematics were waiting for Newton to show the way forward. After having closely studied the masters, he jumped into action. Some of the early topics he chose to work with were light and mathematics.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Scientific Method</h2>
			<p>The Scientific Method that Isaac Newton rigorously followed went on to become a universally accepted practice. We will discuss this Method in detail later.</p>
			<p>He followed a meticulous method of study. In a notebook he called <em>Philosophical Note book</em>, Isaac listed 45 headings under natural philosophy. These include <em>nature of matter, place, time and motion, rarity, fluidity, softness, occult, light, colours, vision </em>and such.</p>
			<p>He read and researched a topic thoroughly and made detailed notes. After researching, he subjected it to scrutiny in the light of the facts that he had observed. He asked many critical questions, which he recorded in a separate part of the notebook and called it <em>Questiones quaedam Philosophcae</em>. Then he sought to find answers through experimentation and observation. In this book he has written thus: <em>Amicus Plato, amicus Aristotles magis amica veritas, </em>translated crudely as<em>, Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth. </em>Newton’s rejection of the Aristotelian theory regarding the nature of matter, which he also used to explain gravitation, is a case in point.<em> </em></p>
			<p>Aristotle had theorized that matter was composed of the four elements of nature. He believed, for instance, that an object made of fire and air would go up while one that was made of water and earth would fall down. An apple falls because it is composed of earth and water.</p>
			<p>Isaac dismissed the theory and concluded that all matter is made of minute particles called atoms. He wondered what would remain ultimately, when matter is progressively divided into smaller parts. Do we arrive at mathematical points of no size? Or do we arrive at actual atoms of some size? If the former were true, Isaac argued that even an infinite number of them, will still be of zero size. He also conjectured that although atoms are very small, they do not shrink to zero size. They may be indiscernible, but they are unbreakable and indivisible.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Early Experiments with Light</h2>
				<p>As pointed out earlier, Isaac was never happy with bookish or abstract knowledge. He had to <em>see </em>and <em>experience </em>to believe. Now he subjected Descartes to his investigation. The Frenchman believed that light was a form of pressure that propagated from the source, i.e., from an object to the eye of the observer. It is this pressure, he opined, that made the observer <em>see</em> the object. To put it in contemporary terms, it was a travelling pressure wave.</p>
				<p>Isaac objected to this theory on many counts. If light was only pressure, why do we not see anything in darkness? He argued that if one accepted Descartes, then a phenomenon such as the eclipse could not occur at all. If Descartes was correct, light too should turn a windmill!</p>
				<p>Isaac next rejected Aristotle’s belief that colour was a mixture of light and darkness and that changing the proportions of the mixture would result in different colours. Isaac argued that if this were true, black ink on white paper ought to produce colours.</p>
				<p>In 1664, to test his own assumptions about light and colour, Isaac went to a fair at Stourbridge, outside Cambridge, and bought a prism and some books. He was well aware that white light passing through a prism scattered into a spectrum of seven colours. He interpreted that the colour of an object depended upon what part of the spectrum the object absorbed and what part of the spectrum it reflected.</p>
				<p>He looked at the sinking sun through a feather and was delighted to behold the rainbow colours. Then he ventured to use his eyes for an experiment (Fig. 17). He looked at the sun with one eye closed. Pale objects appeared red, and dark ones appeared blue. This experiment was dangerous. After several such observations, he ended up seeing pale objects as red and dark ones as blue, and when he looked, all he saw was the bright sun. He could neither read nor write. He had to shut himself in a dark room for several days.</p>
				<p>Undeterred, Isaac embarked on another dangerous experiment a year later. In a bid to discover whether the compression of the eyeball, i.e., the change in radius of curvature, altered one’s perception of colour, he stuck a bodkin (a small dagger) between his eyeball and the bone nearby. Consequently, he observed white, dark and coloured circles. This ‘operation’ could have blinded Isaac Newton!</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Mathematics</h2>
				<p>While in Cambridge, Isaac learnt a great deal about mathematics on his own. How he went about it is very curious and is recorded by the French mathematician, De Moivre. First, Isaac bought a book on astrology at the Stourbridge fair. He could not make much progress as the book was replete with trigonometry. So, he bought a book on trigonometry and studied it. Since geometry was integral to trigonometry, he again made little progress. Isaac tried Euclid’s book on geometry, the most famous in those times. He made some progress. Although he understood theorem statements, he did not bother going through the proofs. At this stage, Isaac bought, <em>La Géométrie, </em>by Descartes and began reading it. He inched through the book until he mastered it. Such an autodidact was he! He also studied books written by Franz van Schooten (<em>Miscellanies</em>), William Oughterd (<em>Clavis</em>), John Wallis (<em>Arithmetica Infinitorium</em>) and others.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly Isaac did not value Euclid (often called the father of geometry) and dismissed his book as <em>trifling</em>. Albert Einstein, who revered Euclid has said, “<em>If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm, then you are not born to be a scientific thinker</em>.”</p>
				<p>His dislike of Euclid had consequences. In 1664, Isaac had to be elected a scholar in order to remain in Trinity to complete a bachelor’s degree. He had to take an examination to qualify for the course. Since there were only a few seats, the competition was intense. Isaac failed twice in 1662 and 1663. Luck favoured him in 1664. His tutor, Pulleyn put in a word of favour to the authorities that Isaac was interested in mathematics and may, therefore, be examined by Isaac Barrow, the Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, whose expertise lay in mathematics. About ten years older than Isaac Newton, Barrow had studied a number of subjects including, Greek, theology, medicine, church history and astronomy and was appointed professor in 1664.</p>
				<p>Though Isaac had read and mastered many well-known books and treatises, he had not studied the prescribed texts simply because they failed to sustain his interest. Yet he appeared for the oral examination. Barrow asked questions related to Euclid’s geometry. We know that Newton had totally neglected Euclid. It would have been to Isaac’s advantage if Barrow had quizzed him on Descartes, whom he had mastered.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, Isaac Newton passed this examination! It appears that his connections at the high ranks worked to his advantage. Humphrey Babington was a senior fellow in the university and was acquainted with King Charles himself. Is this how Isaac Newton passed? Or was he better than the others even in the topics he had neglected? These are some of the unanswered questions.</p>
				<p>His aversion to Euclid did not last long. In course of time, Newton mastered Euclid, for he realized the importance of geometry to understand nature. He familiarized himself with properties of lines, triangles, circles and spheres. He had, of course, read Descartes, who had cleverly combined algebra and geometry to show that abstract algebraic equations could represent a geometric shape such as a curve. This discipline of study is today called analytical geometry. Equations had life; Newton comprehended and went further. Once he understood all the properties of curves – minima, maxima, tangent, area etc., he introduced polar coordinates to construct spirals. He developed equations for the transformation of coordinates (as, for example, from polar to Cartesian), and came up with formulae in both polar and rectangular coordinates for the curvature of a variety of curves, including conics and spirals. Some of these are given in Part 2 of the book. No wonder, that he is often called the<em> originator of polar coordinates</em>.</p>
				<p>Isaac was not a sizar anymore. He received a stipend and a living allowance of 13 shillings and 4 farthings which is equal to a mark each year for the next four years till he received his master’s degree (M.A) from the university. This was a blessing for Isaac Newton who blossomed into a mature researcher. Money was not an issue now. He could concentrate on research and study.</p>
				<p>In 1664, a comet was predicted to pass by earth. Newton seized the opportunity to study its path in relation to fixed stars. He gazed at it all night and into daybreak. Night after night, he lay awake. He lost track of time, and of day and night.</p>
				<p>That was Isaac Newton; he worked ceaselessly. When a problem seized him, his routine fell apart. He simply neglected food and sleep. His dinner would be prepared and laid on the table. But if on his way to the dinner table, he fancied a book or an article, gruel or milk with eggs would stand for hours and automatically become his breakfast! Or as is often said his cat grew fat on a sumptuous breakfast!</p>
				<p>Thus, began one of the greatest explorations in science, which would change man’s view of the universe and of his position in it.</p>
