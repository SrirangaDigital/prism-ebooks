		<p>Summer of 1665 in England brought with it the devastating bubonic plague. A ship brought rats carrying fleas infected with bacteria to London. Death was a certainty for those who contracted the disease, as no cure was available. People began to die in hundreds and then thousands. Some 70,000 people lost their lives in London alone. Records point out that on a few occasions almost 7000 died in a day. About a sixth of London dwellers succumbed.</p>
		<p>The plague made its way to Cambridge but fortunately, the casualties there numbered only 750. Isaac’s mother Hannah on hearing the news wrote to him in her own style –</p>
		<img src="images/0020.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p>Schools and colleges in Cambridge closed and the inmates had to return home. Stourbridge Fair stood cancelled. Most students in Cambridge shifted to nearby villages along with their tutors. Isaac who needed no tutor returned to Woolsthorpe Manor, the only place he could think of. He stayed for eight months in his family house and went to Cambridge for a short spell only to return. It was not until late April, in 1667, that Isaac Newton returned to Trinity College.</p>
		<p>Many historians refer to the period he spent at home, from 1665 to 1667 as Isaac Newton’s <em>Anni Mirabiles </em>(Wonderful Years) for it was during this period that he made outstanding contributions to the field of gravity and optics and invented calculus. However, some scholars disagree with this. In fact, fantasies were built around Newton even during his lifetime. One such fantasy was that he miraculously accomplished this outstanding work in a short span of time when he was away from the university.</p>
		<p>There is a lot of speculation among scholars regarding the exact period and duration of Newton’s Anni Mirabiles. Westfall points out that the magical years for Newton started in 1664 and did not have to wait until 1666 or for him to return home. However, a statement that Newton made later in his life contradicts this argument. He says –</p>
		<p>“<em>In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the Method of approximating series &#38; the Rule for reducing any dignity of any Binomial into such a series. The same year in May I found the method of Tangents of Gregory &#38; Slusius, &#38; in November had the direct method of fluxions &#38; the next year in January had the Theory of Colours &#38; in May following I had entrance into ye inverse method of fluxions. And the same year I began to think of gravity extending to ye orb of the Moon &#38; (having found out how to estimate the force with wch [a] globe revolving within a sphere presses the surface of the sphere) from Kepler’s rule of the periodic times of the Planets being in sesquialterate proportion of their distances from the center of their Orbs, I deduced that the forces wch keep the Planets in their Orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about wch they revolve: &#38; thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth, &#38; found them answer pretty nearly. All this was in the two plague years of 1665-1666. For in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention &#38; minded Mathematicks &#38; Philosophy more then than at any time since.”</em></p>
		<p>According to him, his contributions came within those two years. Nevertheless, while evaluating his contributions, the timeframe and timeline are of little consequence.</p>
		<p>It has been observed that the 24th year in the life of a scientist proves to be the most fruitful year. Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are glorious examples. A recent scientific report claims that for scientists, old age sets in at 27!</p>
		<p>Isaac enjoyed his stay at Woolsthorpe Manor. Hannah by then had forgiven her son for choosing a path other than farming. He basked in the love of a doting mother. He set up his study on the first floor. He built himself a bookshelf and organized the study comfortably; strange furniture for a farming family of those days. Servants did all the chores for him. He was left alone to science and mathematics. He opened the <em>Waste Book</em> he had inherited from his stepfather Barnabas Smith and started recording notes. He questioned, questioned and questioned! While he made notes, he also discovered the <em>truth</em> of things and realized that <em>truth is the offspring of silence and meditation</em>. Little did he know the impact his work would have on mankind.</p>

		<p>Although there is a hint, as noted earlier, that the results of the entrance test to the bachelor’s degree was rigged, it is overshadowed by the extraordinary genius of Newton that made possible his pioneering achievements in natural philosophy.</p>
		<p>His contribution spans all the branches of knowledge. A born intellectual, Isaac Newton lived in the world of thought. He contributed to mathematics, the occult and alchemy. Within the sphere of natural philosophy, he gave a new direction to mechanics, optics and celestial dynamics. He gave us calculus, a tool without which science and engineering would not have evolved into a discipline that shaped the modern world and influenced every aspect of it.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Year of Mathematics, 1664</span></h3>
			<p>Mathematics today is integral to every sphere and branch of science. Galileo had realized the importance of mathematics to explain the workings of the universe way back in the 16th  century. He and other scientists believed that God had developed and hidden ‘the truth’ about the universe in <em>The Book of Nature</em>, in a strange language. One had to learn this language first to be able to discover the secrets of nature. For Galileo, mathematics was ‘the’ language, the key to understanding the universe. Mathematics for him was not just numbers and shapes, but a philosophy, a worldview. Newton’s perception of science was much the same.</p>
			<p>To understand how Newton’s exploration into mathematics started and evolved, we depend upon the account given by John Conduitt (husband of Newton’s niece). Isaac was required to study a number of topics for his B.A. degree. As always, he ignored the curriculum and chose his own path. He adhered to no rule or regulation. His intellect and curiosity could not be bound by a curriculum.</p>
			<p>First, Isaac plunged into a modern analysis of mathematics after having mastered Descartes, Francois Viète, and the mathematics of infinitesimals by John Wallis. The power of his intuition was such that within six months, he thoroughly understood the mathematical analysis developed in the seventeenth century and was ready to break new ground. He had worked on 22 problems in five different categories. The <em>Waste Book </em>was now being populated with numbers and equations.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Birth of Calculus</h3>
			<p>Calculus is one of Newton’s greatest achievements. As is the case with other subjects, his study of calculus too continued for a long period in his life. It is interesting that this great study began with simple questions such as, ‘How to find the area under a curve? How to find the gradient of a curve?’, and culminated in what we now call Integral Calculus and Differential Calculus. These are discussed in Part 2 of the book.</p>
			<p>Students and scholars alike acknowledge differentiation and integration as the two most powerful tools of calculus. It is almost impossible to think of any scientific or engineering calculation that does not involve calculus or its by-product, differential equations. In fact, any kind of motion can be analyzed by solving a set of differential equations. We owe a lot to Isaac Newton who gave us this mathematical form. He had the power and intuition to digest any phenomenon, generalize it, and write down equations that governed it. He calculated the sine values of angles and tabulated them.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German mathematician, accomplished the same by about 1674 and published it. Who is to be credited for inventing calculus? Thus began a fierce controversy in the field of mathematics, which we will discuss later.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Gravity</span></h3>
				<p class="myquote"><em>If you’ve managed to do one good thing, <br />the ocean doesn’t care. <br />But when Newton’s apple <br />fell toward the earth, the earth, <br />ever so slightly, fell <br />toward the apple as well.</em></p>
				<p class="quote-author"><em>– Ellen Bass</em></p>
				<p>Gravity and Newton are inseparable for the common man. If one mentions the name Isaac Newton, then the immediate response is – He sat under an apple tree in his garden; an apple fell on his head. Then he asked himself the question – why did the apple fall down? Why did it not go up? Then the idea of gravity flashed upon him.</p>
				<p>This is one popular fairy tale in science. In fact, such stories emerged in Newton’s time itself and lent an aura of mystery to him and his findings. However, we find that Newton had indeed told some people about his <em>apple tree experience</em>. For example, the French philosopher Voltaire has quoted it. Newton’s biographers argue that Newton did not need a falling apple to explain gravity. He was mulling over it for quite some time and continued to do so long after his <em>Anni Mirabiles</em>. However, here is an account by William Stuckeley with whom Newton was associated in his later years.</p>
				<p><em>We went into the garden, &#38; drank thea under the shade of some apple trees; only he, &#38; my self. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. “why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,” thought he to himself; occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood. “why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but  constantly to the earths center? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. &#38; the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.</em></p>
				<p>Conduitt states,</p>
				<p><em>In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &#38; if so, that must influence her motion &#38; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.</em></p>
				<p>Scottish pharmacologist, Alexander Fleming, who discovered Penicillin, writes, “For the birth of something new, there has to be a happening. Newton saw an apple fall; James Watt watched a kettle boil; Rontgen fogged some photographic plates. And these people knew enough to translate ordinary happenings into something new...”</p>
				<p>Whether the above story is true or false, the apple tree (Fig. 18) by the side of Woolsthorpe Manor has become a tourist spot. A storm in 1820 knocked down the original tree. It re-rooted thereafter and grew. Hundreds of souvenirs were made from the fallen tree, which are treasured by admirers the world over. In fact, a small chip of the tree was taken to the International Space Station in 2010 and was allowed to float in a gravity-free atmosphere while a picture of Newton watched it. Symbolically an apple tree has been planted in front of Newton’s office in Trinity College, Cambridge (Fig. 19).</p>

				<p>Although, Galileo had contemplated gravity and had attempted to measure acceleration caused by gravity, he had failed to explain its effects. Until Newton, a comprehensive conception of gravity did not exist. It is to Newton’s credit that he quantified its effects and consequences, such as acceleration due to gravity, for example.</p>
				<p>Newton’s brilliance lies in his recognition of the fact that gravity, which makes an apple fall down to the earth, also holds the moon in orbit. The earth and the heavens are governed by the same law, he proved.</p>
				<p>Newton thought about motion and started developing axioms, such as the one on motion along a curved path and area under a curve. His <em>Waste Book </em>(inherited from his stepfather) contains about one hundred axioms, which over the next twenty years consolidated into Newton’s Laws of Motion, which we will discuss later and also in Part 2 of the book.</p>

				<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title"><em>Light and Colour</em></h3>
				<p>Newton had before him, two theories:</p>
				<p>a. Aristotle’s theory of colours - according to which colour was essentially a mixture of white and black. As their proportion in a mixture varied, different colours were generated.</p>
				<p>b. Descartes’ theory of light - according to which, light is caused by pressure.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/0023.jpg" alt="image" />
					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 20</span> Newton’s colour experiment</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Newton experimented to prove or disprove these hypotheses. This time, there were no calculations. He had already bought the required equipment – a prism. In his study, he bore a small hole in the window such that the light from outside would fall on a wall 22 feet away (Fig. 20). Some have said that he led light through a hole in the curtain. He placed a prism in the path of light. He observed the rainbow colours, VIBGYOR, on the wall (Fig. 21 A). They were in the form of stripes, not in the form of concentric circles.</p>
				<p>However, it was a known fact that when white light passed through a prism, a band of seven colours would appear. The question was why? Many theories had been put forth. One such was that the prism imparted colours to white light passing through it. Newton premised that these colours already existed in white light and separated on passing through a prism. Separation took place because colours bend (refract) differently when passed through a prism. To prove his point, he placed a second prism down in the path of light. The colours did bend further but did not change (in Fig. 21 A, only one colour is shown passing through the second prism). To prove his point further, Newton placed an inverted prism in the path of light as shown in Fig. 21 B. Now as expected the coloured rays recombined to give white light.</p>

				<p>Newton has stated that all these ideas did not come to him in a flash but were a result of a long thought process, which he called <em>Experimentum Crucis</em>. The phrase actually means that it is a crucial or critical experiment, which passes a judgement on an assumed hypothesis.</p>

				<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue"><em>Mind and Body</em></span></h3>
				<p>Newton’s observations during this period were not limited to mathematics, mechanics and optics. He was interested in many other areas of knowledge. He often wondered about the nature of and existence of the soul. Where is it located? In the brain? How is the soul connected with the rest of the body? What are the roles of mind and body in a given experience? This to him was a <em>mind-body</em> problem.</p>
				<p>He was surprised by the different reactions of different people to the same stimulus. What was sweet to one was bitter to the other. The same music appeals differently to different people. How is it that some people are able to perform certain tasks, such as singing or walking home, unconsciously?</p>
				<p>Then he pondered over imagination and creativity. You may refer to the books written by Westfall and Rob Iliffe to learn more about Newton’s thoughts on this matter. Many of Newton’s non-scientific pursuits may, today be dismissed as meaningless. However, we have to acknowledge the breadth of his intellect, which encompassed many disciplines.</p>
				<p>Newton’s many achievements were indeed glorious. He had moved far beyond any average B.A. student. He had learnt everything that the textbooks of his time had to offer. For him, the days of absorption were over; he had begun to make his own contributions. It is clear that he had something to offer to every branch of knowledge he ever studied. He was not just learning; he was making history.</p>
				<p>We must acknowledge the many, many sleepless nights and his single-minded pursuit of knowledge. Newton learnt the hard way. He did make mistakes but was quick to correct them.</p>
				<p>In the year 1666, Isaac Newton wrote three papers on motion. At the completion of each paper, it is said that the candles went out! He then gave a pause to mathematics. When he turned 24, Isaac Newton was one of the leading mathematicians of Europe; no wonder, other mathematicians grew envious of him.</p>
