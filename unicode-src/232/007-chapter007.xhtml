		<h1 class="level1-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Lucasian Professor</span></h1>
		<p>In early 1667, the fear of the plague had diminished and London was declared safe. Colleges in Cambridge reopened. Newton left his family home and returned to Trinity College. He was no more a lad. In 1666, Grantham had Herald's visitation (tours of inspection undertaken by Kings of Arms) and Newton was upgraded to a gentleman. Newton must have liked it for he began to sign his name as <em>Isaack Newton of Wolstropp. Gentleman aged 23</em>.</p>
		<p>Having cleared the entrance exam for B.A in the year 1664, albeit through influence, Newton’s immediate goal was to pass the B.A. degree examination, and obtain a fellowship at Trinity in order to pursue an academic career. If he failed, then he would have to return to cattle and dung at Woolsthorpe Manor.</p>
		<p>Newton was at the lowest rung of the academic ladder. The first step towards ascent was to be elected a fellow of the college. There were only nine vacancies, one for the master and the rest for senior fellowships. The competition was fierce. Some of the ministers in the university, fellows and even the King of England exerted their influence. The <em>viva voce </em>was a difficult exam to clear and was held over four days in a church. Again, Newton was to be examined in subjects he had grossly ignored. Humphrey Babington was a senior fellow. Did this help again? Newton passed this examination effortlessly, it appeared.</p>
		<p>Newton, now a minor fellow, could remain in Trinity for as long as he pleased. In fact, he lived there for twenty-eight years. One of the first things he did was to buy tools worth £1, which included a lathe. Then he spent £2 on a bachelor’s gown, convertible to a master’s. The gown proved a worthy investment considering that he received the degree of Master of Arts, M.A. within nine months. All fellows had to take the Holy Orders in the Anglican Church. This, Newton did on October 2, 1667 and swore – <em>I will embrace the true religion of Christ with all my soul …I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes arrives, or I will resign from the college. </em>The position also required that chastity be observed; marriage was forbidden.</p>
		<p>He was now eligible for a stipend from the college. A small allowance from his mother, a little fee from the students he tutored and the stipend formed his income. Newton equipped himself for research by purchasing lab equipment, a tin furnace and books on alchemy. He also bought chemicals as his book of accounts shows –</p>
		<img src="images/0026.jpg" alt="image" />
		<p><em>Theatrum Chemicum</em> is a compilation of treatises on alchemy with which Newton was actively experimenting. He had several furnaces in his room. Newton’s hair turned gray as early as 1670. His friend Wickins attributed it to his undivided attention to work, while Humphrey Newton (Isaac Newton’s assistant and distant relative) attributed it to his experimentation with quicksilver i.e., mercury.</p>
		<p>Some events of 1669 opened Newton’s eyes to the world around. Maybe it was time to come out of hiding and tell others of his achievements. He was hesitant and wary. Several historians have observed that Newton was shy and would not talk about his findings freely with others. We also learn that he was scared of possible criticism from others. He was now forced to reckon his status as a researcher vis a vis other researchers. Although Newton by now had achieved a lot more than his contemporaries, none of his works had been published. Nicholas Mercator had published a book titled <em>Logarthimo Technica </em>in 1668. He had come up with a method to calculate logarithms of numbers based on a series expansion for log (1+x). Isaac Barrow in Cambridge received this book from John Collins, a mathematician, known for his extensive correspondence with scientists of the day in order to disseminate information. Barrow knew that Isaac Newton had done work on a similar topic and wrote to Collins that he had a friend in Cambridge who,</p>
		<p><em>‘hath a very excellent genius to these things, brought me the other day some papers wherein he hath sett downe methods of calculating the dimensions of magnitudes like that of Mr. Mercator concerning the hyperbola, but very generall; as also of resolving aequations</em>.’</p>
		<p>Barrow sent Newton’s paper D<em>e analysi per a equationes numero terminorum infinitas (On the Analyses by Infinite Series) </em>to<em> </em>Collins without revealing the author’s name. In a subsequent letter, though, Barrow mentioned the name of the author,</p>
		<p>‘<em>His name is Mr. Newton; a fellow of our college, &#38; very young (being but the second year of Master of Arts) but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things.’</em></p>
		<p>Barrow’s words clearly establish his regard for Newton’s work.</p>
		<p>Collins and Newton both realized that Newton had achieved far more than Mercator. Collins communicated the paper to many mathematicians in Europe. He and Barrow tried to persuade Newton to publish the paper. Newton did not oblige. In 1670, he sent Collins a formula to calculate an annuity based on infinite series. As before, he permitted its publication with his name removed.</p>
		<p>Barrow entrusted Newton with the job of revising his eighteen lectures on optics. Although the student had far exceeded the teacher’s achievements, he carried out the assignment.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Newton Becomes a Professor</span></h2>
			<p>Barrow was the first to hold the Lucasian chair established by Henry Lucas in 1664. It was one of the eight professorial positions in the university and the only one for mathematics and natural philosophy (science). After holding that position for about five years, Barrow resigned. Two reasons have been cited for his resignation; one, he wished Isaac Newton to occupy the chair; the other and more probable is he wanted to rise to higher positions. In fact, within a year, he became Chaplain to the King and later Master of Trinity College.</p>
			<p>On October 2, 1669, at the young age of 26, Isaac Newton was appointed Lucasian Professor with a handsome salary of £100 a year. Newton, the ill-prepared student who had been examined by Isaac Barrow just five years before, would not have dreamt of this success.</p>
			<p>After Newton occupied the chair, the Lucasian Professorship became a very prestigious position in Cambridge. Eminent mathematicians and physicists such as Charles Babbage, Paul Dirac, Stokes and Stephen Hawking occupied the chair after him.</p>
			<p>We do not know what Isaac Newton felt about his appointment to the chair. Was he pleased or did he take it as a matter of course?</p>
			<p>The professorship entailed lecturing students every week for the three academic terms of a year. The professor had to deposit in the library, handwritten copies of any 10 lectures that he delivered in class every year. Failure to do so incurred a fine.</p>
			<p>Among the topics for lecture suggested to Newton were geometry, geography, astronomy, optics, statics and mathematics. Right from the days of Barrow, professors paid little attention to lectures; a trend which continues to this day. It was to Newton’s disadvantage that he was not a very impressive speaker. Another fact known now is that he stuttered.</p>
			<p>Humphrey Newton has observed -</p>
			<p><em>when he read in the Schools, as being Lucasianus Professor, where so few went to hear Him, &#38; fewer that understood him, that oftimes he did in a manner, for want of Hearers, read to the Walls.</em></p>
			<p><em>When he read in the Schools, he usually staid about half an hour, when he had no Auditors he Commonly return’d in a 4th  part of that time or less. Mr Laughton, who was then the Library Keeper of Trinity College resorted much to his Chamber, if he commenced Doctor after that, I know not.</em></p>
			<p>Occupying this important position now, Newton was undoubtedly the most famous intellectual in England. Yet not a single student has said, “I heard his lectures.” Not even William Whiston, his student who succeeded him as the Lucasian professor. That Newton hated lecturing is evident from the fact that for the year 1687, he deposited only four manuscripts of his lectures in the library. Newton started his lecturing career with optics and spoke about the theory of light and colours. During his lectures, he demonstrated several concepts through experiments using lenses and prisms. He stressed that mathematical precision was important in science and advised students not to dwell on ‘probable’ knowledge.</p>
			<p>He resumed his study of optics from the plague days at Woolsthorpe Manor. He performed his two-prism experiment in a more sophisticated manner. He confirmed again that the prism did not modify white light to break into a spectrum, but white light itself was composed of seven colours. Up to the year 1672, Newton had performed many experiments related to optics, none of which he had published. He chose to discuss them in his masterly treatise entitled <em>Opticks</em>, published much later.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Further Studies in Mathematics </span></h2>
				<p>In 1670, Newton sidelined optics and took up mathematics again. Barrow entrusted Newton with two projects: one, to revise and expand his own paper D<em>e analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas </em>and the second, to annotate the Dutch book <em>Algebra</em> by Gerald Kinckhuysen. Newton completed the latter in 1670 and sent it to Collins who communicated it to a few mathematicians in Europe. They were happy to see Newton’s involvement but also longed to see his own treatise on the subject. Newton, as before was reluctant to publish any of his works. Even when his discoveries were made known to others, he ensured his name was withheld. For instance, he indicated to Collins, that the author’s name on the front page of his revision of Algebra by Kinckhuysen should appear as <em>enriched by another author</em>. His reluctance to own his work in the public sphere lasted all his life.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Telescope</h3>
			<p>On the sidelines of his continuous correspondence with Collins, Newton was engaged in another, very different activity, the construction of a telescope. Hans Lippershey had introduced the telescope to the scientific community as early as 1608. The year after, in 1609, Galileo also built a telescope. It is said that he used it initially to watch ships at a distant harbour. Only later, did he observe heavenly bodies, the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, etc. The telescopes built by Galileo and Lippershey, known as <em>Refracting Telescopes</em>, were built using refracting lenses, which split white colour. The resulting image was not very clear.</p>
			<p>In addition to his path-breaking findings in Optics, let us not forget that Newton was a very good artisan. Even while he studied optics at Woolsthorpe Manor and at Cambridge, he was well aware that the telescopes of the day had a serious drawback. Refracting lenses of those days were coarse and produced Chromatic Aberration. The lens had to be ground to perfection, but there was no technology yet to achieve such perfection in the 17th century.</p>
			<p>Newton built a <em>Reflecting Telescope </em>with parabolic mirrors to focus light. Fellow astronomers had desisted using parabolic mirrors because they could not polish the mirrors to the required accuracy. Newton’s knowledge of alchemy came in handy now. He invented an alloy to polish the mirrors. Making a tube and mount for the telescope was no problem for our gifted carpenter. He succeeded in building a telescope (Fig. 22) in February 1669, measuring 15 <em>cm</em> or 6 inches in length with a magnification of 40. Comparatively, the refracting telescope was 1.8 metres or 6 feet length and Galileo’s telescope was of 92.7 <em>cm</em> (36.5 inches) in length with a magnification of 20. Newton claimed to have observed Jupiter and its satellites through his telescope. He followed it up by building a second one.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Only two and a half years after building the telescope, did Newton hand it over to Barrow who presented it at a meeting of the Royal Society in London in December 1671. The members of the Society were baffled and thought that the king should have a look at it. Soon the telescope travelled to Whitehall to the king. Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Society sent Newton a letter of admiration,‘<em>it has been examined here by some of the most eminent in optical science and practice, and applauded by them.</em> Strangely enough, the Society took on itself the task of <em>securing this invention from the usurpation of foreigners</em>. Newton expressed surprise as to <em>how much care it took about securing an invention to me of which I have hitherto had so little value. </em>Huygens, a contemporary scientist, hailed it as <em>the marvellous telescope of Mr. Newton</em>.’</p>
			<p>A reward followed. On January 11, 1672, Newton was voted a fellow of the Royal Society, a prestigious honour even today. In gratitude, Newton revealed the theory behind his telescope to the members of the Society through an elaborate letter- <em>A Theory of Light and Colours</em>. All the details of the telescope and the alloy used for polishing its mirrors were made known to the Society. Now Isaac Newton did not hide his authorship. He even volunteered to be present at the meeting, during which his paper would be presented and discussed. However, as can be expected, he did not bother to attend the meeting. With his telescope, Newton had established himself in the field of natural philosophy too.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Newton vs Hooke</span></h2>
			<p>Newton’s paper on Light and Colour turned out to be explosive. It fired great debate in the realm of science. Before we describe the upheaval in detail, it is necessary to acquaint ourselves with Robert Hooke, a famous natural philosopher and his work.</p>
			<section class="level3 unnumbered" epub:type="chapter" role="doc-chapter" id="id-">
				<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Robert Hooke (1635 – 1703)</h3>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>Robert Hooke (Fig. 23) was born in Freshwater and was the last of four children. He became a staunch monarchist and developed an interest in observation, mechanical works and drawing. He studied at the Westminster School in London and mastered Euclid. He was a mathematician. He studied mechanics all through his life. He also had a natural flair for languages and mastered many. In 1653, Hooke joined Oxford University where he assisted Thomas Willis and the well-known Robert Boyle (famous for Boyle’s Law). He made friends with a group of scientists at Oxford consisting of Boyle and 11 others. This group was the nucleus of the Royal Society, since its inception in 1660. His function in the Society was to curate experiments using his own methods or the ones suggested by others.</p>
				<p>Incidentally, Hooke was also interested in almost every area that Newton was studying. He was well-versed in anatomy and geology, and engaged himself in flying machines, and watchmaking among other pursuits. However, their personalities were poles apart. Newton could shut himself away for days and study or meditate over something. Hooke, on the contrary, was social, visiting pubs, moving from one coffee house to another.</p>
				<p>Hooke too had fabricated a telescope, or so he claimed, and apparently had watched Jupiter. He built a microscope and observed small organisms. In 1665, he published <em>Micrographia</em>, a treatise on microscopy. This book also contains his theory of light. Hooke believed that light travelled as waves in a homogeneous medium. Scholars believe that Newton had read <em>Micrographia</em>, appreciated it and learnt from it, although he would not admit it in public.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Corpuscular and Wave theory of light</span></h2>
			<p>Contemporary science proposes the dual nature of light i.e., light travels in the form of waves or pressure pulses and light is composed of particles or corpuscles that travel one behind the other. During Newton’s time the Corpuscular and the Wave theory (Fig. 24) were considered mutually exclusive. Aristotle and Newton were proponents of the Particle Theory, which easily explained reflection of light. Huygens, Young and Hooke were the early pundits of the Wave Theory, which explained refraction and interference of light.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>For centuries, the debate regarding the structure of light has raged on. In 1905, Albert Einstein discovered the photoelectric effect, which supported the particle theory, and for which he won the Nobel Prize. However, his later work favoured the wave theory. Just a little later, physicists such as Niels Bohr, De Broglie, and others proposed that light exhibits a dual nature – it exists as a particle and as a wave too.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Newton’s Paper Presented</span></h2>
			<p>A compilation of Newton’s work on optics spanning many years was presented as a paper entitled <em>A Theory of Light and Colours</em> to the Royal Society in 1672 in his absence.</p>
			<p>Newton in his paper delineated his prism experiment and his method of measuring angles of refraction. He also explained his two-prism experiment and concluded that <em>every coloured ray has an intrinsic predisposition to suffer a particular degree of refraction</em>.</p>
			<p>Thus, he asserted that a theory of light can be formulated based on mathematical principles, and stated that white light is composed of all the primary colours. He explained that the colour of any object is the colour it reflects. Thus, a red body reflects red rays. Though he agreed that it was difficult to deduce the structure of light conclusively, he stated that it could also not be denied that light was corpuscular.</p>
			<p>Iliffe points out that the essay was not merely the most radical challenge to accepted views about optics in modern history, but was a clear statement about what Newton took to be the proper way to investigate and justify scientific claims.</p>
			<p>Oldenburg wrote to Newton to say that the paper was received with <em>singular attention and uncommon applause. </em>He sought permission to print it in <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>. The Society also suggested that members repeat and verify Newton’s experiments. (The secretary of the Royal Society, Henry Oldenburg, a German by birth and a master of many languages, was determined to disseminate knowledge widely across Europe. He edited a journal called <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>. Scientific papers presented at the Society meetings, were considered for publication in this journal.)</p>
			<p>Several members of the Society voiced their approval and admiration of Newton’s work. One such was Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer and mathematician, although he developed reservations later.</p>
			<p>Robert Hooke was not pleased. Within a week, he wrote to Oldenburg and attacked Newton’s Corpuscular Theory. Apparently, Hooke took three to four hours to write his criticism. Scholars have opined that Hooke mistook the Corpuscular Theory to be the central theme of the paper. Hooke also rejected Newton’s hypothesis that a prism merely splits the colours of light and does not add any. He argued that a prism behaves like a violin or an organ that adds its own sound to air. He argued that his numerous experiments proved that his wave theory explained the phenomena of refraction appropriately. Newton, he claimed, did not have a single convincing experiment in defense of his theory.</p>
			<p>Newton was not one to treat criticism in good spirit. His paper was the result of eight years of hard work and many sleepless nights. He did not tolerate any negative criticism to his <em>Experimentum Crucis.</em></p>
			<p>To begin with, the very word <em>hypothesis </em>that Hooke had used, enraged him. According to Newton, his claim was <em>not a hypothesis</em> but it was <em>the final word</em> and had to be respected! He wrote a lengthy response to Hooke’s objections, which took almost four months. Correcting him, Newton said that what Hooke was referring to (structure of light – Particle or Wave?) was not a hypothesis he had stated. He lodged an attack on Hooke’s wave theory: How can it explain the fact that light travels in straight lines? Even if Hooke were half as good an experimenter, he would have found Newton to be right. Oldenburg had advised Newton to refrain from mentioning names in his rebuttal, especially that of Hooke. Newton paid no heed; he mentioned Hooke’s name in the very first sentence and at twenty-five different places, almost on every page. Here is an extract –</p>
			<p><em>Mr Hook thinks himself concerned to reprehend me for laying aside the thoughts of improving Optiques by Refractions. But he knows well that it is not for one man to prescribe Rules to the studies of another, especially not without understanding the grounds on which he proceeds.</em></p>
			<p>Newton wrote and rewrote this rebuttal four times and it turned out to be longer than his original paper. He had garnered a wealth of data on optics from his studies, lectures and experiments. Newton’s reply itself is a significant contribution to the study of optics. After reiterating his findings, he insisted that physical principles as well as mathematical proof were important in science. What resulted was a <em>star war</em> of words and mutual accusations. Hooke wrote to the members of the Society that he had performed all the experiments suggested by Newton and was unable to accept his theory.</p>
			<p>Christiaan Huygens (Fig. 25), who had also supported the Wave Theory of Light, filed his objections to Newton’s theory. In fact, he put forth convincing explanations for reflection and refraction of light using the Wave Theory. It was not easy to refute his argument, and his theory is still valid. He also believed in the presence of a limited number of basic colours from which all other colours emerged.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0030.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 25 </span>Christiaan Huygens</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Newton sent Huygens a harsh reply. Oldenburg, who acted as the postmaster for all of Newton’s correspondences, tried to pacify Huygens by telling him that Newton was a man of repute. Realising that Newton was adamant, Huygens decided to withdraw from the scene. Yet, he was generous enough to send Newton a copy of his book <em>Horologium Oscillatorium</em>. Newton, in turn, was kind enough to acknowledge its receipt. (Robert Boyle was another scientist who honoured Newton by sending him a copy of his book).</p>
			<p>Among his other antagonists was Pardies, a well-known professor from Paris. Although he raised objections, he did not want to start a controversy. He simply bowed to Newton’s greatness and remained silent. Liege Jesuit Francis Linus (Hall) was another critic who, although, did not refute Newton’s theory, expressed his grievance that it was difficult to adhere to Newton’s instructions fully in order to perform experiments to test his theory. Linus and his followers (after his death) challenged Newton to prove his theory convincingly. Newton shot back saying that Linus and his group had not followed his instructions. He stressed the importance of using quality prisms and specified the need to measure the angle of refraction correct to a minute, not to a degree.</p>
			<p>Vexed by all this criticism and instead of engaging in objective discussion, he decided to withdraw in March 1673. He wrote to Oldenburg –</p>
			<p><em>Sir I desire that you will procure that I may be put out from being any see I shall neither profit them, nor (by reason of this distance) can partake of the advantage of their Assemblies, I desire to withdraw. If you please to do me this favour you will oblige</em></p>
			<p><em>Sir Your humble Servant</em></p>
			<p><em>I. Newton</em></p>
			<p><em>I have presumed to put you once more to the trouble of receiving my quarterly duty as Fellow of the Royal Society. At next Lady day I am behind hand for half a yeare, &#38; have therefore sent you 1pounds  6shillingsby John Stiles. I hope you will excuse this trouble, it being the last. I shall be henceforth absent from Cambridge for about a month.</em></p>
			<p><em>These</em></p>
			<p><em>For Henry Oldenburg Esquire at his hous about the middle of the old Pall-Mail in Westminster</em></p>
			<p><em>London</em></p>
			<p>Oldenburg tried to placate Newton, for his withdrawal, would be a loss to the Royal Society. He wrote to him that the members of the Society had the greatest respect for him. Any criticism made was very mild and common. He also pointed out that Newton had not even met these people in person. But Newton did not relent. He wrote –</p>
			<p><em>‘I intend to be no further solicitous about matters of philosophy; and, therefore, I hope you will not take it ill if you never find me doing anything more in that kind; or rather that you will favour me in my determination, by preventing, so far as you can conveniently, any objections, or other philosophical letters, that may concern me.’</em></p>
			<p>Newton withdrew completely from the scene. After two years, Newton himself reopened the case by writing two more papers – <em>A Hypothesis Explaining the Properties of Light</em> and <em>Disclosure of Experiments</em>. They were companion papers; the first put forth his speculations on nature of light and matter. The second described experiments, which attempted to prove the hypothesis. As much as Newton tried to remain objective, he could not refrain from making jibes at Hooke. He accused Hooke of plagiarizing Fabri, a French scientist. Hooke retaliated, accusing Newton of plagiarizing his own <em>Micrographia</em>.</p>
			<p>Now, the two started communicating directly. There was some dignity and mutual respect for some time. In 1676, Newton tried to sum up the debate in these words, which are the most quoted words in science –</p>
			<p><em>What Des-Cartes did was a good step. You have added much several ways, &#38; especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</em></p>
			<p>Some interpreted these words as indicative of Newton’s humility. Others were certain his words were meant only to mock Hooke. It is very admirable that on April 27, 1676, Hooke performed experiments before the members of the Society to validate his antagonist’s <em>experimentum cruces</em>. A theory, if factually sound, stands irrespective of who proposes it and who verifies it. Newton’s hypothesis was proved right and elevated to a theory, ironically, by his rival. A strange occurrence in science, indeed!</p>

				<h3 class="level3-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">To take orders or not</span></h3>
				<p>Newton had been a fellow of Trinity College for nearly four years now and had risen to the rank of a professor. To retain his Chair and fellowship, he had to become an ordained member of the Anglican clergy within seven years of becoming a fellow. Failing to ordain himself thus, the fellowship worth a handsome amount of £60 a year would be at risk.</p>
				<p>Newton was a religious man. The Bible was another means to discover the truth in God’s mind, which was also the purpose of his scientific pursuits. His religious studies had begun when he was admitted to the school in Grantham. He had read books from the church opposite his school and from the library of Barnabas Smith, his stepfather. He had also bought four books on theology when he joined Trinity.</p>
				<p>Now, with his focus on theology, another notebook with various orthodox headings emerged. Newton never took any subject lightly. He immersed himself in serious theological study. This and his interest in alchemy (of which we will learn later) may be responsible for his slow response to the criticism leveled against his paper on light. He even indicated to Oldenburg in 1674 that he intended <em>to concern myself no further about promotion of philosophy.</em> He had also given up hopes of retaining the fellowship at Trinity College. At one point in time, he even wrote to Oldenburg asking him to waive off his dues to the Society.</p>
				<p>During this period, Newton challenged the Christian assertion that Church, Christ and God were the same. Newton could not openly air his views against the Church; that would incur heavy penalties and the wrath of the church. His views came to light only after his death.</p>
				<p>It was impossible for him to equate Christ with God. In the words of Joel Levy, </p>
				<p><em>‘he became convinced that a fraud had been perpetuated to corrupt the legacy of the early Church, and that the scripture itself had been corrupted to support trinitarianism.’</em></p>
				<p>It may be noted that Trinitarianism (Fig. 26) claims that God exists in three distinct, simultaneous, co-eternal, and co-powerful forms known as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. His notes on this topic spanned nine pages in his notebook. He traced the origin of this corruption of the dogma to the fourth century. According to Newton, the conventional Catholic/Anglican doctrine, which worships Christ as God, was idolatry and a most fundamental sin. It was as if Newton had uncovered the crime of the millennium.</p>
				<p>In the words of Westfall, it<em> is not hard to understand why Newton became impatient with minor diversions such as optics and mathematics. He had committed himself to a reinterpretation of the tradition central to the whole of European civilisation.</em></p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/0031.jpg" alt="image" />
					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 26 </span>A Logo of Trinitarianism</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>His belief was at loggerheads with at loggerheads with at loggerheads with at loggerheads with at loggerheads with the ordination, for he was required to accept the thirty-nine articles of the Anglican Church, which included Trinitarianism. Ironically, he had ‘accepted’ this three or four times in the past, when he took a degree or a fellowship or the professorship. Would he repeat the drama? No. Isaac Barrow was now the Royal Chaplain. Perhaps, it was with his support that the king exempted any Lucasian professor from taking orders and Newton was allowed to continue as professor and save his fellowship.</p>
				<p>Exemption granted, Newton did not give up theology. He remained interested in it throughout his life.</p>
