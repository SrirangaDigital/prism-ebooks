		<p>When viewed from the high pedestal upon which we have placed Isaac Newton, it is puzzling that he was involved in many pursuits, which are now considered unscientific. After the publication of his paper on light and colour, we have seen that a volcano of discussion erupted. Voices of praise, as well as dissent, were heard from scientists all over Europe. The scientific community waited for some response from Newton; needless to say, the community was met only with silence. His replies, if at all, came very late. In his replies to Oldenburg, Secretary of Royal Society, he often said that he was busy with other things,<em> business of my own which at present almost take up my time &#38; thoughts</em>.</p>
		<p>It was Newton’s engagement with this <em>business</em> that delayed his response to Hooke and dragged the dialogue for years. As a result, at one point of time, he was even ready to sever contact with the Society, one of the highest bodies for Natural Philosophy. The ‘business of his own’ that he mentions was not mechanics or mathematics, or even optics. It was alchemy. Records indicate that Newton may have started this venture in 1669. It was not just a pastime or a preoccupation; he was engrossed in it.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Alchemy, the Predecessor of Chemistry</span></h2>
			<p>Alchemy was a speculative discipline with a long history.</p>
			<p>It was the predecessor of the stream of science we call <em>Chemistry</em> today, although it encompassed many other faculties such as religion, occultism and spirituality. It involved all the methods of chemistry, such as mixing of powders and potions, heating, dissolving, distilling and such processes. Hundreds of chemicals including mercury, iron and various acids were distilled in crucibles, furnaces and alembics.</p>
			<p>The art of alchemy emerged in Egypt between the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE where, the Hermetic Tradition took birth. Then, the Islamic countries took to alchemy and it reached Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Some masters of alchemy claimed they could converse with spirits and exercise control over the weather. Alchemical activities, discoveries and studies were often shrouded in secrecy. Alchemists developed their own vocabulary and codes as shown in Fig. 27.</p>

			<p>Alchemy was practiced in most of the early civilisations of India, China and Egypt. The Vedas from India describe a connection between eternal life and gold. The use of mercury, very sacred to practitioners of this art, was documented as early as the 3rd and 4th centuries. In India, it was called <em>Rasāyana</em>, meaning a manipulation of nectar, mercury and juice to be used as drugs, compounds and medicine, which was supposed to restore youth and health. Apparently, a Buddhist monk had developed a method of converting mercury into gold.</p>
			<p>During the seventeenth century (the time of Newton) Europe witnessed the rise of a network of alchemists exchanging ideas, books and knowledge. A number of Newton’s contemporaries were involved in alchemy. A large section of the society compared it to sorcery and condemned it as an illegal practice meant to cheat people with tall claims of transmuting any metal into gold. Many practitioners of alchemy lost money, their homes and even their powers of discrimination.</p>
			<p>The main objectives of alchemy were to, (1) create the philosopher’s stone (Fig. 28), which purportedly had magical powers (2) transmute ordinary metals into noble metals (gold or silver) using the philosopher’s stone, and (3) develop <em>elixir vitae</em>, which supposedly prolonged youth and bestowed longevity.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Newton, an Alchemist</span></h2>
			<p>It is baffling that a man of Newton’s caliber believed that an ordinary metal could be converted to gold. Scholars have searched for answers. For Newton, his alchemical inquisition was part of his pursuit of truth. In the contemporary world, advancement in knowledge and technology is an index of wisdom and civilization; in the 17th century, ancient civilisations were believed to be ‘closer to God’ than the civilized ones, for they had gained perfect wisdom, or <em>prisca sapientia</em>. This concept is analogous to the existence of a perfect crystal or substance of zero entropy in Thermodynamics. From that point onwards, humankind corrupted perfect wisdom. Alchemy was a tool to rediscover that wisdom and re-establish humanity’s proximity to God. It was an instrument to decode what God had hidden in the universe. Boyle, for instance, believed that it could explain many important functions of nature.</p>
			<p>True, alchemy was entirely different from the mechanical philosophy that Newton upheld at the Royal Society. Mechanical philosophy was concerned with body or matter and attempted to explain everything in terms of mechanics. Alchemy, on the other hand, searched for the spirit hidden in all matter. There was life everywhere, in the firing of a cannon, the falling of a stone and the moon circling the earth. In all actions of the universe, there was a male element, a female element and a spirit.</p>
			<p>It is clear that gold or money was the last thing that interested Newton. He was a philosopher in search of the Christian truth. What mattered to him was truth and truth alone. Being born on Christmas Day, he thought it was his mission to search for it and that he was well equipped to do so. He also used a pseudonym to write his alchemical writings, <em>Jeova Sanctus Unus</em> meaning <em>One Holy God</em>, which reiterates the spiritual nature of his pursuit.</p>
			<p>Newton was not alone in his alchemistic endeavours. Lifetimes were spent in its pursuit and many of his contemporaries were deeply engaged in it. He did not need a formal induction into alchemy. He had started his internship in his school days. He learnt about dyes and remedies for a few diseases from the book by Bate - <em>The Mysteries of Nature and Art</em>. He had copied them into his notebook. Working with Clark in his apothecary was the next step. In his college days at Trinity, Humphrey Babington introduced him to chemistry, while Henry More an alumnus from King School in Grantham was an alchemist himself. Newton was deeply involved in alchemy for a long time: while he worked for Isaac Barrow, developed his theories of light and during the critical debate that followed the publication of his papers.</p>
			<p>Though his early studies provided him with the foundation, the real alchemical inspiration came from Robert Boyle (Fig. 29) who was one of those responsible for the formation of the Royal Society. He wrote a book, <em>Sceptical Chymist</em> that attempted to mold chemistry on a scientific basis. Newton and Boyle met in 1675 and became good friends. Consequently, Newton filled his notebook with 47 headings related to alchemy including Amalgam, Crucible, Extraction and <em>Menstruum Peracutum </em>(the recipe for a substance that dissolved gold).</p>

			<p>For about two years from 1668, Newton made many trips to London. He met ‘friends’ here and there. Information about alchemy flowed from mysterious sources including the Hartlib circle of which Newton was a member. Hartlib, an alchemist from Prussia, lived in London and had a big following. In the period 1630 – 1660, Hartlib and his associates exerted their influence over intellectuals in Europe and America on many matters – alchemy, agriculture, medicine and religion.</p>
			<p>Newton and Boyle were conscious of two distinct practices in natural philosophy – one was the <em>magical</em> way of the alchemists and the second was the <em>scientific </em>method of the modernists such as Descartes. They tried to combine the two approaches. <em>The Origine of Formes and Qualities</em> by Boyle was a product of this dual interest. Newton seems to have learnt a great deal in his company and utilized his learning substantially when he formulated his own theories of gravity and light.</p>
			<p>Newton travelled to London for the first time in 1669 and bought quite a few pieces of equipment including a furnace and <em>Theatrum Chemicum</em>. He also bought some books on Alchemy. When Newton died, his personal library contained 169 works on alchemy and chemistry. Michael White, who authored a biography of Newton has said that <em>he possessed the finest and most extensive collection of alchemical texts</em>. He read voraciously for nearly twenty-five years and made extensive notes (Fig. 30). His reading was not limited to printed texts; it included handwritten manuscripts as well. Prof. Dobbs confirms, Newton probed <em>the whole vast literature of the older (i.e., pre - seventeenth century) alchemy as it has never been probed before or since. </em>In Westfall’s estimate, Newton’s alchemical notes total over a million words.</p>

			<p>For some time Newton shared a chamber with Wickins. His alchemical adventures took place in a shed attached to this chamber. Humphrey Newton became his assistant in 1683 when Wickins left. He writes about the way Newton worked in his laboratory,</p>
			<p>
				<em>He very rarely went to Bed, till 2 or 3 of the clock, sometimes not till 5 or 6, lying about 4 or 5 hours, especially at spring &#38; ffall of the Leaf, at which Times he us’d to imploy about 6 weeks in his Elaboratory, the ffire scarcely going out either Night or Day, he siting up one Night, as I did another till he had finished his Chymical Experiments, in the Performances of which he was the most accurate, strict, exact: What his Aim might be, I was not able to penetrate into but his Paine, his Diligence at those sett times, made me think, he aim’d at somthing beyond the Reach of humane Art &#38; Industry. I cannot say, I ever saw him drink, either wine Ale or Bear, excepting Meals.</em></p>
				<p>While modern science stresses reproducibility of results, alchemy did not. It was indeed not possible to repeat experiments and get the same result, since the results obtained from alchemical experiments were dependent upon the performer and his mental and spiritual attitude and status. Spontaneous instinct played an important role in these studies. No wonder, mainstream science looked down upon alchemy. That is the reason why most alchemical works were carried out in secrecy, and was hence coded and encrypted.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly, Newton invested in alchemy the same dedication and passion as he did for his study of gravity and optics. He wrote down headings in his notebook, studied related literature and asked questions. Sometimes, he jotted down more than 50 different descriptions under the same heading. He used the jargon of his fellow alchemists. To quote from Joel Levy <em>– in some passage Newton writes ‘a wondrous bright water in which the sun doth set’</em>, decoded as<em> ‘mercury (wondrous water) has been used to dissolve gold (the sun). </em></p>
				<p>In 1677, a fire broke out in his laboratory destroying quite a number of his papers, and speculation has been rife that these could have included many of his alchemical observations and his early work on optics. Unfortunately, we lost things that Newton wanted to tell us.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">In search of Regulus</span></h2>
				<p>Newton believed in the transmutation of substances. Mercury or quick silver was considered an ideal transmuting agent for two reasons: it is the only metal that exists in liquid form at ordinary temperatures, and it dissolves most metals including gold to form amalgams. For Newton, <em>mercury</em> was <em>prima materia</em> meaning the <em>first matter</em>. However, <em>prima material</em> was<em> </em>not the same as quicksilver or ordinary mercury. The alchemist’s aim was to isolate <em>prima materia </em>or the soul of all matter from the rubbish. It was the primordial form of all metals. Once <em>prima materia </em>is<em> </em>isolated, they believed they could convert it <em>into </em>philosopher’s mercury and then into philosopher’s stone. This process was called <em>putrefaction</em>. The <em>prima materia</em> could be transmuted to any other metal including gold through another process called vivification. The former undertook the cleansing of the substance while the latter instilled life into it. These were considered as the male and female aspects respectively. The belief was that metals could also be vegetated as plants and animals.</p>
				<p>Attempting putrefaction, in one of his experiments, Newton dissolved ordinary mercury in nitric acid and then added lead and copper. When allowed to precipitate, only ordinary mercury remained at the bottom of the container. A disappointing result. He could not separate the dross and obtain <em>prima materia</em>!</p>
				<p>His next venture was to manufacture <em>Regulus </em>or <em>little king,</em> a crystalline compound of antimony and iron with shards radiating outwards. Newton thought he had succeeded only to realise later that Regulus was not philosopher’s stone.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Universal Spirit</span></h2>
				<p>Alchemists including Newton believed in the existence of a spirit or a force that acted upon the universe, which was responsible for all activity in the universe, be it the germination of a seed, birth of an animal, a chemical reaction, or transmutation of a metal. Newton called it <em>vegetative spirit</em> because its influence was plant-like. Proving the existence of that spirit and understanding it was more important than the philosopher’s stone or the elixir. It is no surprise that poet William Blake called this spirit, a <em>Divine Geometer</em> (Fig. 31).</p>
				<figure>

					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 31</span> The Divine Geometer</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Around 1672, Newton may have had a spark of inspiration.</p>
				<p>He wrote,</p>
				<p><em>The vegetation is the sole effect of a latent spirit &#38; that this spirit is the same in all things. </em></p>
				<p>Newton envisaged a spirit or a force that acted throughout a mass. Thus, an idea had been sown in his mind that would germinate into the concept of gravity, a force that acts within a body and between two bodies even though there is nothing material between them, sometimes referred to as <em>Action at a Distance</em>. The implied meaning is that a body such as the earth can influence the motion of the moon even though there is no physical contact between the two.</p>
				<p><em>There is therefore .. in the textures of the grosser matter a more subtle secret &#38; noble way of working in all vegetation .. &#38; the immediate seat of these operations is not the whole bulk of matter, but rather an exceeding subtle &#38; unimaginably small portion of matter diffused through the mass which if it separated there would remain but a dead and inactive earth. </em></p>
				<p>Compare the above statement with what he says in 1686, at the end of his masterly treatise <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.</p>
				<p><em>And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle Spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies; by the force and action of which Spirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one another at near distances, and cohere, if contiguous; and electric bodies operate to greater distances, as well repelling as attracting the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted, reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited, and the members of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by the vibrations of this Spirit, mutually propagated along the solid filaments of the nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain into the muscles. But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and elastic Spirit operates.</em></p>
				<p>Thus, alchemy too was a blessing in disguise for he could conceptualise gravity. His experiments in alchemy continued until his death. Of course, he had no luck as far as the fundamental quests of alchemy were concerned.</p>
				<p><em>Westfall observes, there is no reason to expect that he should have remained satisfied for ever with his first love. Mechanical Philosophy had surrendered to his desire, perhaps too readily. Unfulfilled, he continued the quest and found in alchemy and in allied philosophies a new mistress of infinite variety who never seemed fully to yield… Newton wooed her in the earnest for thirty years. </em></p>
				<p>Newton was not just a theoretician; he was a hard-core experimentalist. He tested, built apparatus such as furnaces and crucibles. He wrote down his observations in a language only his alchemy friends could understand. For example, he wrote,</p>
				<p><em>May 10 1681 I understand that the morning star is Venus and that she is the daughter of Saturn and one of the doves…. </em></p>
