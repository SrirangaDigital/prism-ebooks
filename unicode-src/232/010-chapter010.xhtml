		<p><em>God showed himself to be Newton’s equal in Mechanics when He built His cosmos upon them, </em>says Westfall in<em> Never at Rest, A Biography of Isaac Newton. </em></p>
		<p><em>Princi</em>p<em>ia Mathe</em>m<em>atica</em> undoubtedly is one of the most influential books ever written. Newton gave us a model of the physical world and the tools to calculate the motion of objects both solid and fluid. The book changed the course of science altogether and the laws stated therein are used even today in science and engineering.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Hooke Throws a Challenge</span></h2>
			<p>The events that led Newton to write this treatise are quite interesting. It is not wrong to say that irritation and not inspiration may have been the cause. Newton had made quite a few advances in both mechanics and optics since his Anni Mirabiles days. After the several controversies with fellow scientists, especially the one with Robert Hooke, Newton withdrew from the public sphere. He severed all contact with the Royal Society and with Oldenburg, its Secretary. But he never gave up contemplation and study.</p>
			<p>His isolation did not last long. Several developments around him goaded him into action. The first of such was the death of Oldenberg, the Secretary of the Royal Society in November 1679 and the subsequent appointment of Robert Hooke as Secretary.</p>
			<p>Hooke invited Newton to participate in the deliberations of the Society and offered his own paper, published five years before, for discussion. We are not certain that Newton was aware of its publication at that time. Perhaps, Hooke’s intention was to bring Newton back to the Society. Hooke, in his paper, had put forth a hypothesis that <em>planetary motions are compounded of a tangential motion and an attractive motion towards the centrall body. </em></p>
			<p>We know that if the sun does not pull the planets towards its centre, the planets will assume straight line paths and shoot off in tangential directions (Fig. 32). A similar phenomenon occurs with respect to moon’s revolution around the earth. While Hooke only proposed this theory, Newton proved it mathematically in the years to come. Hooke’s proposition thus foretells Newton’s own discoveries, to be revealed later in his <em>Principia</em>.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Newton was not interested in any controversy or dialogue with Hooke and brushed him aside, saying he had no time for such discussions. He compared himself to a tradesman who was not concerned with the activities of another tradesman. Newton however offered a reply delineating his own theory about a falling body. He argued that a falling body does not hit a stationary earth, but an earth rotating about its axis. Therefore, it does not land at point B but reaches point D as shown in Fig. 33. Without the resistance of earth, (or in the absence of it) the object would trace a spiral, DEC, as shown.</p>

				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 33</span> Newton’s Response</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Hooke was quick to point out that the path of the falling object would be an ellipse and not a spiral as shown in Fig. 34. ABDE is the surface of the earth; AFGH is the path of the object when there is no resistance and AIKLMNOPC is the path with resistance. Obviously, there was a mistake in Newton’s understanding. He had mixed up theories for a falling body and for Orbital Mechanics. This correspondence led the two scholars to conceive the inverse square law. Newton confessed to Dr. Edmond Halley (1656 – 1742), English astronomer and mathematician, eponymous with the Halley’s Comet, on a later occasion that this indirect communication with Hooke prompted him to review Orbital Mechanics.</p>

				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 34</span> Hooke’s Answer.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Hooke by this time had exhausted his intellectual resources and abilities. He left it to the greater master Newton to complete the theory. Hooke has said,</p>
			<p><em>That by your excellent method (Calculus) you will easily find out what that curve must be and its properties and suggest a physical reason of this proportion. </em>
			</p>
			<p>The challenge, therefore, was to arrive at a mathematical expression to show that if the force between a planet and the sun should obey an inverse square law, then the planet must follow an elliptical orbit. Newton did not respond to Hooke but was preparing for his masterstroke.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Call of the Comet</span></h2>
			<p>The second invitation that prompted Newton to write the <em>Principia</em> came from a comet. In the winter of 1680–81, a comet called <em>The Great Comet</em>, appeared in Europe, a brilliant and frightening phenomenon. Most astronomers assumed that there were two comets, not one. The first appeared early one morning in November while the second appeared early evening in mid-December. The latter was four times the size of the moon and was seventy degrees long, meaning that the angle subtended by the extremities of the comet at the centre of the earth was 70°.</p>
				<p>John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer of the day was intrigued by its sheer size. However, he believed that there was only one comet, which was sighted twice. He opined that the comet had changed its direction near the sun and given the impression of two comets. He wanted someone to corroborate his belief and looked up to Newton. Since he was not well acquainted with Newton, Flamsteed approached him through a friend. Newton had closely observed the comet with powerful telescopes. He had also gathered data from fellow observers and existing literature. He wrote two long letters to Flamsteed rejecting and criticising his one-comet theory.</p>
				<p>In 1682, another comet, now called <em>Halley’s Comet </em>made its appearance. (Fig. 35) Again, Newton made careful observations and collected data. He developed a clear understanding of comets. Most astronomers and scientists then believed that comets were bodies foreign to our solar system and consequently, laws true to planetary motion were not applicable to them. In fact, they thought comets followed rectilinear paths. After a careful study, based on his own observations and those of others, Newton revised his opinion asserting that comets too, like our planets, obeyed the inverse square law and followed curved paths. He eventually also conceded that Flamsteed was indeed right! There was only one comet. Although, by now, he had made considerable progress in his Universal Law of Gravitation, he kept it to himself.</p>
				<p>The third motivation to write <em>Principia</em> was a meeting of the Royal Society. Halley and Christopher Wren (a noted English architect, well-versed in astronomy and mathematics) were also engaged with Hooke’s challenge to Newton. They were all interested in Celestial Mechanics, Inverse Square Law and Kepler’s Laws. However, none of them could translate the ideas into mathematical formulations.</p>
				<figure>

					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 35</span> Halley’s Comet as seen in 1910.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>At the January 1684 meeting of the Royal Society, Hooke boasted that he had already solved the challenge. Wren was skeptical and demanded that Hooke present proof within two months. Seven months went by and there was no sign of any proof. Halley realised the futility of expecting a solution from his friends, and in August, rushed to Cambridge to meet the only man who he was certain would find it.</p>
				<p>What happened in Cambridge is best explained by Newton himself in his recollections made to the famous French mathematician, DeMoivre. Here is an extract from the latter’s writing.</p>
				<p><em>In 1684 Dr Halley came to visit him at Cambridge. After they had been some time together, the Dr asked him what he thought the curve would be that would be described by the planets supposing the force of attraction towards the sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it. Sir Isaac replied immediately that it would be an ellipse. The Doctor, struck with joy and amazement, asked him how he knew it. Why, saith he, I have calculated it. Whereupon Dr Halley asked him for his calculation without any farther delay. Sir Isaac looked among his papers but could not find it, but he promised him to renew it and then to send it him…</em></p>
				<p>Scholars opine that Newton probably played safe. The paper could not have been lost, for, in fact, it exists even today. Maybe, he did not want another episode such as the one with Hooke. Or perhaps he wanted to redo and cross-check his calculations and verify his results before making public the paper; which he did, only to reconfirm the veracity of his results.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">De Motu Corporum in Gyrum</span></h2>
				<p>In November, Newton sent a nine-page paper to Halley through one of his friends. It was, infact, a treatise titled <strong>De Motu Corporum in Gyrum</strong><em> (On the Motion of Bodies in an Orbit)</em>. He had mathematically shown that an elliptical orbit entails inverse square law. Through his calculations, he also demonstrated that his theory was in accordance with Kepler’s Second and Third Laws. Halley realised that Newton had achieved something unprecedented in Celestial Mechanics. He once again rushed to Cambridge to meet Newton and requested his permission to present the paper to the Society. Newton promised that he would send the paper to be duly registered. Flamsteed informed the Society of this great progress. The paper synthesised all the knowledge that Newton had gathered about motion, and contained four theorems and five problems concerning motion in the absence of resistance.</p>
				<p>Halley’s role in getting the best out of the master cannot be undermined. The master did not stop there. He delved deeper into the subject. He actively corresponded with Flamsteed requesting more data concerning the orbital periods of Jupiter’s satellites and the magnitudes of their orbits, about comets that made appearances, velocities of Jupiter and Saturn and even about tides in the estuary of Thames.</p>
				<p>Newton was restless and knew very well that he had undertaken a task of great importance. There was a vast amount of information to synthesise. His daily activities including the essential ones such as eating took a big hit. Humphrey Newton, who has recorded all of his eccentricities during this time, writes,</p>
				<p><em>When he has sometimes taken a Turn or two, has made a sudden stand, turn’d himself about, run up the stairs, like another Archimedes, with an </em>Εὔρηκα<em>,(Eureka) fall to write on his Desk standing, without giving himself the Leasure to draw a Chair to sit down in.</em></p>
				<p><em>At some seldom Times when he design’d to dine in the Hall, would turn to the left hand, &#38; go out into the street, where making a stop, when he found his Mistake, would hastily turn back, &#38; then sometimes instead of going into the Hall, would return to his Chamber again.</em></p>
				<p>Newton was involved in an epoch-making study and these minor aberrations of behaviour are of little consequence.</p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Emergence of Principia</span></h2>
				<p>Although the Society assumed that Newton would polish the paper and send it, in reality, he worked to enhance the scope of his paper <em>De Motu</em>, from mere motion of objects in orbit to motion of all objects. He had a grand plan and was aiming very high. He went to the heart of the matter and attempted to formulate the basic dynamics involving motion of bodies. He consolidated the concept of <em>inertiae or inertia, </em>introduced by Galileo and captured the basics of Dynamics. All this study combined with his ingenuity culminated in the Three Laws of Motion, which we will discuss later. Over two years, the nine-page paper De Motu, after several revisions, transformed into a treatise of two volumes or <em>Books</em> as he called them. It was almost ten times the length of the parent paper. A third volume (or <em>Book</em>) was also in the making. Principia is thus a combination of these three volumes.</p>
				<p>In the words of Westfall,</p>
				<p><em>The investigation that seized Newton’s imagination late in 1684 and dominated for the following two-and-a-half years transformed his life as much it transformed the course of Western science. </em></p>
				<p>Newton writes in the preface to his masterpiece,</p>
				<p><em>But after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of gravity, and other forces; and the figures that would be described by bodies attracted according to given laws; and the motion of several bodies moving among themselves; the motion of bodies in resisting mediums; the forces, densities, and motions, of mediums; the orbits of the comets, and such like; deferred that publication till I had made a search into those matters, and could put forth the whole together.</em></p>
				<p>In April 1686, Isaac Newton placed in Halley’s hands the first part of the resulting manuscript <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). </em>Halley, now the clerk of the Society, immediately informed the members of its receipt and declared it ready for print. It was approved for publication. However, Halley had overstepped his authority, for Newton had still not officially permitted its publication. To complicate matters, the Society had no funding for publication and decided that Halley should bear the cost. He was to be the publisher of the great book. This was a great responsibility, which would elevate his status in academic circles. Halley, however, was not rich. Besides, he was just married.</p>
				<p>Halley had a tough time with Newton who would not consent to any revisions or changes suggested. On the other hand, he made revisions endlessly. Speculation was rife in academic circles about whether Newton would acknowledge Hooke for suggesting the inverse square law. Newton expressed to Halley that Hooke had said nothing that he was unaware of himself; and that Hooke had only imagined the Inverse Square Law by reading Newton’s previous correspondence with him. He proclaimed that he had pestered him for years. He accused Hooke of being a great pretender. He even threatened to withhold Volume (Book) 3 of <em>Principia</em> at one point of time.</p>
				<p>Even as Newton was busy with parts Two and Three of the treatise, Halley used all his diplomatic skills to persuade him to permit the printing process. By July 1687, the book was ready. Halley sent Newton twenty copies to be distributed among the philosophers of Cambridge. Their immediate reaction was as expected.</p>
				<p>In the words of Humphrey Newton,</p>
				<p><em>After the Printing Sir Isaac was pleas’d to send me with several of Them, as Presents, to some of the Heads of Colledges, &#38; others of his Acquaintance, some of which (particularly Dr. Babington of Trinity) said That They might study seven years, before They understood anything</em> of it.</p>
				<p>A student who saw Newton on a street remarked,</p>
				<p><em>There goes the man that writt a book that neither he nor anybody else understands.</em></p>
				<p>These exclamations may be compared with the ones made when Albert Einstein presented to the world his theory of relativity. Someone remarked that <em>only three people in the world understood relativity.</em></p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Inside Principia</span></h2>
				<p>Written in Latin, <em>Principia (Fig. 36) </em>comprises of three books. It begins with a section called <em>Definitions </em>that discusses the concepts of absolute time, absolute space and motion. Then he introduces terms such as <em>mass, inertia </em>and <em>centripetal force</em>. For example, mass is defined as:</p>
				<p>Quantity<em> of matter [or mass] is a measure of matter that arises from its density and volume jointly. </em></p>
				<p>Newton defined every term along with a formula to measure it. Although we use terms such as mass, velocity and inertia in our daily conversations and technical discussions, we are not aware that it was Newton who introduced them and defined them. In fact, they have become a part and parcel of physics. Refer to Part 2 for details.</p>
				<p>Before elaborating his Laws of Motion, Newton defines time and space thus:</p>
				<p><em>Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anythingexternal, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...</em></p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/0041.jpg" alt="image" />
					<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 36</span> Principia in original.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Time, according to Newton, is a dauntless river which flows unaware of its shores.</p>
				<p>So was space, which he defined as,</p>
				<p><em>Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies: and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space. </em></p>
				<p>Consequently, one hundred meters for me will be a hundred meters for everybody. These ideas appeal to common sense. We are all accustomed to this belief.</p>
				<p>Ordinary men and scientists remained complacent in this belief for more than two hundred years. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) overturned this hypothesis in 1905 and showed that both space and time depend upon how they are measured. A stationary observer and a moving observer measure different values for space and time. However, these relativistic effects are pronounced only at speeds nearer to that of light.</p>
				<p>Then, Newton explains the concept of relative motion in comparison to absolute motion.</p>
				<p>The treatise continues with <em>Newton’s Laws of Motion, </em>as known today<em>. </em>Refer to Part 2 for an elaborate discussion.</p>
				<p>The treatise then continues as Book 1, Book 2 and Book 3 in which Newton discusses the consequences of his laws.</p>
				<p><strong>Book 1, De Motu Corporum</strong><em> (On the Motion of Bodies), </em>discusses motion of bodies in the absence of resistance, for instance, friction. The book presents theorems concerning centripetal force and Kepler’s law. One important outcome of this book is the formalisation of the concept of gravity, which had haunted him all his life.</p>
				<p>He stated:</p>
				<p><em>Of this sort is gravity, by which bodies tend to the centre of the earth .. and that force, whatever it is, by which the planets are perpetually drawn aside from the rectilinear motions, which otherwise they would pursue, and made to revolve in curvilinear orbits</em>. (Taken from Joel Levy).</p>
				<p><strong>Book 2</strong>, (untitled) talks about resistance to motion, hydrostatics and flow of compressible fluids. Here Newton dismisses Descartes’ Mechanical Theory, which states that motion is a result of the interaction of vortices. At the same time, Newton considers fluid motion with resistance.</p>
				<p><strong>Book 3, De Mundi Systemate </strong><em>(On the System of the World)</em>, deals with gravity and some of its consequences on astronomy. Newton showed many interesting facts, which were a consequence of the application of his theories from Books 1 and 2. Some of these are an explanation for the perturbations in the orbit of Saturn, density of air at different heights, weights of the same mass on Earth and on the Sun’s surface. He showed that the earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid. The book also contains a detailed discussion on comets, their orbits and functions.</p>
				<p>The unification of Galileo’s theories based on his experiments on force and motion and that of Kepler’s Laws is a great achievement in this book.</p>
				<p>Newton’s Laws along with the Law of Universal Gravitation have many interesting consequences. These include the effect of earth’s gravity on the surface of the moon, the weight of an object on the moon, 'the magnitude of the earth's gravity, weight of the earth, the fact that earth is not a perfect sphere and the effect of gravity on tides. Some of these are discussed in Part 2 of the book.</p>
				<p>At the beginning of Book 3, Newton presented what he called <em>Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy,</em> which formulated the Scientific Method as is in use today. These are:</p>
				<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong><em>We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong><em>Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Rule 3:</strong><em>The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Rule 4:</strong><em>In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypothesis that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.</em></p>
				<p>Such a prescription was perhaps necessary because many philosophers then were still Aristotelian, and dismissed experimentation altogether. According to them, those who performed experiments were just technicians. Real philosophers, on the other hand, contemplated, reasoned and evolved knowledge. If an experiment did not correspond to a theory they had proposed, it was because the technician was ill-equipped or the experiment was not performed properly. For instance, if a commonly held ‘fact’ such as <strong>heavy body falls faster than a light body or that the earth is the centre of the universe </strong>could not be verified through experimentation, then it was not because the fact was indeed false, but because the technician was incorrect or the experiment itself was faulty. Newton cautioned against such unscientific attitude.</p>
				<p>He insisted that verification with experimentation was indispensable in scientific study. The journey of a scientific investigator he opined begins with an observation of the world around. The investigator must then strike at the root of his observation and formulate a possible explanation for the phenomenon observed or, in scientific terminology arrive at a <em>Hypothesis</em>. He must, thereafter, devise experiments and perform them. Based on the results obtained through experimentation he must either accept or reject the hypothesis. This is how a scientific theory should be established. Thus, <em>Theory guides, experiment decides</em>.</p>
				<p>Newton cautions that it is not possible to understand everything for an individual or even a whole generation,</p>
				<p><em>To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. ‘Tis much better to do a little with certainty, and leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things. </em></p>
				<p>The fact that scientific research continues ceaselessly stands testimony to this fact. Every scientific discovery reveals that there is more to be understood. The reality of the four fundamental forces in nature remains a mystery.</p>
				<p>In this spirit, Newton would not speculate beyond what he could prove. He had observed the consequences of gravity and was able to enunciate the Law of Universal Gravitation. However, he had no means to find out the cause of gravitation. Therefore, he did not attempt an explanation. However, he believed that a spirit or ‘some active principle’ governed the Law of Universal Gravitation, which allowed the transmission of force from one body to another.</p>
				<p>He writes in <em>Principia</em> (taken from Iliffe),</p>
				<p><em>And therefore those Ancients who rightly understood the mystical philosophy taught that a certain infinite spirit pervades all space &#38; contains &#38; vivifies the universal world; and this spirit was their numen, according to the Poet cited by Apostle: In him we live and move and have our being. </em></p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">The Fame of Principia</span></h2>
				<p><em>Principia’s </em>greatness lies in the fact that it stands as a pioneering work of what can today be called modern scientific methodology. This monumental work took him only twenty years. Even teams of scientists would have taken much longer to accomplish it.</p>
				<p><em>Principia</em> has had a great impact on our understanding of the physical world. It marked the cornerstone that separated philosophers and scientists. Earlier, philosophers had a say in every occurrence of the universe. The term natural philosophy was also in vogue. With the advent of the book, scientists were different and had a clear method of work. The method to establish a scientific fact was defined – observe, hypothesize, experiment, collect data and infer, and then formulate a theory.</p>
				<p>The definitions, propositions and proofs therein gave us a system to understand the physical phenomena around us such as falling of a stone, tides, motion of planets and their moons and comets. Particularly unprecedented was the exactness in description; every feature such as velocity, acceleration and force had a specific number. His theory was extended to include fluid motion. He formulated equations to calculate fluid motion, which are in use even today in the design and understanding of flying objects including airplanes and spacecrafts. Extensions to calculate vibrations of bodies, flow of heat etc. followed. John Dalton’s atomic theory was another consequence.</p>
				<p>Thus, the master had created what may be called the Newtonian Model, which can be used as a key to understand almost everything. People used it to understand human nature and the sciences as well.</p>
				<p>The book made history. Philosophers (scientists) of the day were waiting for such a treatise. Halley, the first admirer was astonished by its contents. He wrote a review in the <em>Philosophical Transactions.</em></p>
				<p>The review begins this way,</p>
				<p><em>This incomparable Author having at length been prevailed upon to appear in publick, has in this Treatise given a most notable instance of the extent of the powers of the Mind; and has at once shewn what are the Principles of Natural Philosophy, and so far derived from them their consequences, that he seems to have exhausted his Argument, and left little to be done by those that shall succeed him. His great skill in the old and new Geometry, helped by his own improvements of the latter, (I mean his method of infinite Series) has enabled him to master those Problems, which for their difficulty would have still lain unresolved, had one less qualified than himself attempted them.</em></p>
				<p>David Gregory, the Scottish mathematician, and astronomer, John Locke, the British philosopher, Oxford academic and medical researcher, Abraham De Moivre, the French mathematician and others learnt of the book and rushed to read it. Locke called Newton <em>one of the intellectual giants of the age</em>. Very soon, three leading journals published reviews of the book. It was hailed as <em>the most perfect mechanics that one can imagine</em>.</p>
				<p>In Europe, two leading mathematicians, Christiaan Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz read the book with care. Huygens found the theory of attraction rather absurd, while Leibniz objected that Newton had not given the cause of gravity. However, both confessed that they were certainly influenced by Newton’s work. Huygens praised the book for the <em>beautiful discoveries</em> he found in it and made it a point to meet Newton when he was in England. He was in continuous correspondence with Newton until his death in 1695. Marquis de l’Hôpital reacted by saying <em>Good God what a fund of knowledge there is in that book?</em></p>
				<p>The greatest discoveries stand the test of time. <em>Principia</em> is a perfect example. British astronaut Tim Peake named his 2015 mission into space after <em>Principia. </em>About 4000 people were consulted to suggest a name for the mission. <em>Principia</em> was suggested 20 times. He says,</p>
				<p><em>Not only does it have the link with space and gravity but also it’s a celebration of science and that is what the space station is about now.</em></p>

				<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Revision of Principia</span></h2>
				<p>Newton undertook a revision of <em>Principia </em>in 1711. A young academic and a fellow of Trinity, Roger Cotes assisted him in this venture. Newton cooperated but expressed annoyance when Cotes pointed out an error. Newton advised him thus,</p>
				<p>… <em>you need not give yourself the trouble of examining all the calculations of the Scholium</em>. <em>Such errors as do not depend upon wrong reasoning &#38; can be of no consequence &#38; may be corrected by the reader</em>.</p>
				<p>Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli found an error in the procedure of a particular problem that Newton had solved and informed him through his nephew (Nicholas Bernoulli).</p>
				<p>Upon examination, Newton located the error. This correction turned out to be very time consuming, a good two and a half years. The issue with Leibniz, which we shall discuss later, was another distraction that delayed the revision process. At times, revision progressed slowly and at others, it came to a standstill. Newton in his customary manner did not bother to thank Cotes, in print or word, for his help in revision.</p>
				<p>He concluded the treatise almost poetically,</p>
				<p><em>This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent being. And if the fixed Stars are the centers of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, must all be subject to the dominion of One. [...] This Being Governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all: And on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God </em>παντοκρατωρ, <em>(pantokrator), or Universal Ruler.</em></p>
