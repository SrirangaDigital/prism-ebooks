		<p>The solitary pursuit of Newton into gravity and motion had fructified in the form of <em>Principia</em>. His fame travelled far and wide. A copy of <em>Principia </em>was sent to the king of England, James II with an indication that Newton’s calculations regarding tides might interest him. There is no information as to whether the king was interested or impressed.</p>
		<p>The king in a bid to appoint Catholics to key positions in major institutions sent a mandate to the vice-chancellor of Cambridge (mostly a Protestant university) to accept a Benedictine monk, Father Alban Francis and award him a master’s degree, overlooking eligibility and procedure. He was not to be administered any oath. Conferring degrees to men at the behest of the powerful was not unprecedented. However, the difference in the case of Alban Francis was that he would remain in the university and participate in its proceedings. Newton was a branded anti-Catholic and was obviously against the appointment. The university senate chose him as one of the eight advisors to the vice chancellor to protest against this appointment. Newton readily accepted. Consequently, the king dismissed the vice chancellor and threatened disciplinary action against Newton and the other advisors. Newton did not concede; the Benedictine monk did not get his degree. Soon, James II was dethroned and the kingdom fell into Protestant hands. William of Orange became the new king.</p>
		<p>The king called for a new Parliament. By now, Newton’s fame as the author of Principia and as one who took a bold stand against the former king had reached its peak. The university elected him as one of the two Members of Parliament from Cambridge. He moved to London where he lived for the most part of the year. No more a solitary philosopher, he now had the honour of dining with the king.</p>
		<p>Parliament records do not mention any active participation of Newton in its deliberations. An often-quoted incident is as follows. He stood; the entire house fell silent. They thought he would make a speech. All he said was, “Would somebody mind closing down the window? There is a bit of draft, my wig may fall off.” Then he sat down!</p>
		<p>London was not as confined a place as Cambridge. Newton met many important people who visited the city. These included Christiaan Huygens who had raised objections to his Theory of Light. The two had a couple of meetings and attended the sessions of the Royal Society together. He acquainted himself with the philosopher John Locke. They talked of religion and discussed the Bible. Locke praised him as <em>the incomparable Mr Newton</em> in his 1690 masterpiece, <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. </em>During this period, Newton, Locke and Boyle had corresponded several times in matters of alchemy. Charles Mordaunt, the Earl of Monmouth and Charles Montague, an English politician were among the others who became acquainted with him. Newton’s personality during this phase underwent a sea change. He was no more the sullen, withdrawn individual with whom conversation was impossible. He turned out quite friendly. Now that <em>Principia</em> had been published and accepted by the community, he probably felt less threatened. He no longer had to fear criticism. Newton, now very influential, developed friendships with youngsters. One of them was Edward Paget, a master at a school run by Christ’s Hospital. David Gregory was another who sought Newton’s help and became the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. William Whiston was once an undergraduate student of Newton and had attended his lectures. Following Newton’s work, he submitted a thesis, <em>New Theory of the Earth</em>. He not only became Newton’s deputy but also succeeded Newton when he relinquished the Lucasian Chair in 1701. Edmond Halley, another disciple of Newton was appointed to another Savilian Chair at Oxford.</p>

			<p>One acquaintance that Newton made during this period and who had considerable influence on him and his life was Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (Fig. 37), a young man, twenty-five years of age. He was a brilliant Swiss mathematician and visited London in June 1689. He carried a letter of recommendation from a person well-known to the Royal Society and was thus admitted as a member. He met Newton in a meeting of the Society where Huygens presented his work on gravity and light.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Newton immediately took to the handsome, intelligent Fatio. He could not live by science alone, it suddenly seemed. Emotions and desires, which probably he had suppressed for too long in pursuit of science, began to take wings. Newton longed to be with Fatio. When Newton returned to London for his second term in the parliament, he wrote to Fatio - <em>I intend to be in London the next week &#38; should be very glad to be in the same lodging with you. I will bring my books and your letters with me.</em></p>
			<p>Newton later spent a month with Fatio in London when the latter transcribed a part of Book II of <em>Principia</em>. The two read together <em>Treatise of Light</em> by Huygens. On many an occasion, Newton was absent from Cambridge, spending time in London. Fatio is known to have informed Newton of some potion developed by one of his alchemical friends, supposedly a marvellous cure for many ailments. He had coaxed Newton to invest in its development and eventually market it.</p>
			<p>Newton shared all his knowledge, be it mechanics, theology, alchemy or mathematics with Fatio. It is interesting that Fatio became a liaison of sorts through whom Huygens and Leibniz learnt about Newton’s views on gravity, light and mathematics. He had become an informant!</p>
			<p>Then there was a surprise. Soon after Fatio left London in 1692, he wrote a letter to Newton.</p>
			<p><em>I have Sir almost no hopes of ever seeing you again. With coming from Cambridge I got a grevious cold, which is fallen upon my lungs… I thank God my soul has been extremely quiet, in which you have had the chief hand… Were I in a lesser feaver I should tell you Sir many things. If I am to depart this life I could wish my eldest brother, a man of extraordinary integrity, could succeed me in your friendship…</em></p>
			<p>To which Newton replied,</p>
			<p><em>I last night received your letter, with which how much I was affected I cannot express. Pray procure ye advice and assistance of Physicians before it be too late, and if you want any money I will supply you. I rely upon the character ye give of your elder brother, and if I find that my acquaintance may be to his advantage I intend he shall have it… Sir, with my prayers for your recovery, I rest, </em></p>
			<p><em>Your most affectionate and faithful friend, to serve you, Is Newton</em></p>
			<p>Obviously, Fatio feared his cold excessively. He lived another sixty-one years! Newton clung to Fatio, writing to him offering him money and accommodation to keep him close to him. However, Fatio decided to distance himself. He stated:</p>
			<p><em> I could wish sir to live all my life, or the greatest part of it, with you.</em></p>
			<p>Then he told somebody, <em>the reasons I should not marry will probably last as long as my life. </em></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Breakdown</span></h2>
			<p>By the end of 1692, after Fatio’s exit from his life, Newton withdrew once again from society. He barely communicated. Then he suddenly wrote a letter to Samuel Pepys, one of his friends, a product of Cambridge University, Member of Parliament and well-known diarist.</p>
			<p><em>September 13, 1693.</em></p>
			<p><em>Sir,</em></p>
			<p><em>Some time after Mr Millington had delivered your message, he pressed me to seeyou the next time I went to London. I was averse; but upon his pressingconsented, before I considered what I did, for I am extremely troubled at theembroilment I am in, and have neither ate nor slept well this twelve month, norhave my former consistency of mind. I never designed to get anything by yourinterest, nor by King James’s favour, but am now sensible that I must withdrawfrom your acquaintance, and see neither you nor the rest of my friends any more, if I may but leave them quietlv. I beg your pardon for saying I would see youagain, and rest your most humble and most obedient servant,</em></p>
			<p class="text-right"><em>Is. NEWTON.</em></p>
			<p>This letter was followed by one to John Locke.</p>
			<p><em>SIR, </em></p>
			<p><em> Being of opinion that you endeavoured to embroil me with women, and by other means, I was so much affected with it, as that when one told me you were sickly and would not live, I answered, ‘twere better if you were dead. I desire you to forgive me this uncharitableness; for I am now satisfied that what you have done is just, and I beg your pardon for my having hard thoughts of you for it, and for representing that you struck at the root of morality, in a principle you laid in your book of ideas, and designed to pursue in another book, and that I took you for a Hobbist( a 17th century philosopher).I beg your pardon also for saying or thinking that there was a design to sell me an office, or to embroil me. — I am your most humble and unfortunate servant,</em></p>
			<p class="text-right"><em>Is. NEWTON.</em></p>
			<p>The manic euphoria that Newton experienced during the success of his <em>Principia</em> did not last long. In 1693, known as his black year, Newton suffered a bout of depression that lasted nearly eighteen months. The news first reached Huygens. Friends confined him until he regained his composure. Leibniz, John Wallis and many other natural philosophers of Europe heard the news and were rather distressed.</p>
			<p>However, it is true that Newton was not in sound mind as the above letters clearly indicate. Both Pepys and Locke made inquiries about Newton’s mental health with people they knew in Cambridge. Newton eventually replied to Locke and stated the truth.</p>
			<p><em>The last, winter, by sleeping too often by my fire, I got an ill habit of sleeping; and a distemper, which this summer has been epidemical, put me farther out of order, so that when I wrote to you, I had not slept an hour a night for a fortnight together, and for five days together not a wink.  remember I wrote to you, but what I said of your book I remember not. If you please to send me a transcript of that passage, I will give you an account of it if I can.</em></p>
			<p>We should not forget that he had a similar breakdown, although of a lesser degree, in 1677. Westfall has speculated at length the possible reasons for this breakdown. In his opinion, the writing of <em>Principia</em> stretched Newton’s mental stamina beyond limits. He had undertaken a monumental work of assembling different strands of mechanics into a single unifying theory. His failure to secure, in 1689, the position of a provost at King’s College in the university and the subsequent soliciting of employment in London in 1690, added to the pressure. By 1693, he had stopped his theological endeavours and was concentrating on revising <em>Principia</em> and had also begun writing on optics. This was an onerous task. He was disillusioned with alchemy. There may have been a fire as well. Above all perhaps, the abrupt end, after four years, of his friendship with Fatio, contributed to this breakdown.</p>
			<p>Newton did come out of his depression, but Westfall points out that after his revival, he did not start anything new in natural philosophy, alchemy or theology. On hindsight, his creative activity had come to an end. He spent the remaining thirty-four years of his life reworking the results of his earlier studies.</p>
			<p>One such was the study of manifold perturbations of the lunar orbit. These perturbations are a result of the moon’s orbit, which is not a regular mathematical curve as the earth is not a perfect sphere; it is flattened at the poles. The study of lunar perturbations leads to what scientists call the Three Body Problem, frequently encountered in the realms of Classical and Quantum Mechanics. The motion of a planet and its satellite around a star is an example from Classical Mechanics. For Newton, the three- body problem consisted of the motion of the moon and the earth around the sun.</p>
