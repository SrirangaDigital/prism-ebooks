		<h1 class="level1-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">The Controller of the Royal Mint</span></h1>
		<p>The <em>Princi</em>p<em>ia</em> fame brought a few professional invitations to Newton. In May 1690, he learnt through a friend (a solicitor) that the government was looking for a suitable candidate for the position of Controller for the Royal Mint in London. Newton was disappointed with the fact that the fame of <em>Principia </em>had not fetched him bigger positions in the University and society. In fact, his peers had risen higher than him. Besides, the college was steeped in financial doldrums and Newton was considering moving out of Cambridge to pursue his academic interests. However, London was a better place to make a living and have a good time.</p>
		<p>It was against this background that Newton was willing to accept the position of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696. His well-wisher Charles Montague, who became Baron Halifax in 1700, signed his letter of appointment. He was a Member of the Treasury and President of the Royal Society. Newton prepared to leave Trinity in Cambridge after thirty-five years of stay. Although he retained the fellowship and the chair, he visited Cambridge only for half a week during his tenure of five years at the Mint. As can be expected, he corresponded with none of his associates back in Cambridge.</p>
		<p>The Mint was not a bed of roses; neither was Trinity College. The Mint was crisis-stricken. It was a small department within the Treasury, which was engaged in meeting the financial needs incurred by the on-going war with France. The Treasury itself belonged to the government.</p>
		<p>As Westfall observes,</p>
		<p><em>The Mint was an institution within an institution within an institution, all three of which faced crises.</em></p>
		<p>Besides, the silver coin, which was the currency in vogue, had become excessively debased. Counterfeit silver coins adulterated with copper had gained widespread circulation. The government was considering recoinage as a remedy. It was at this crucial juncture that Newton assumed responsibility as warden.</p>
		<p>When consulted for his opinion, Newton wrote an essay, <em>Concerning the Amendm the of English Coyns</em>. His thoughts were well-received and prompted the Treasury to implement recoinage. Newton took it upon himself to see the project through. Predecessor wardens of the Mint had treated the position as only a sinecure, a position which paid but demanded no action or responsibility. In fact, Montague who had elevated Newton to the position had also considered it as a sinecure, earning him about five to six hundred pounds. Yet, Newton who never flinched from duty, supervised the recoinage process very efficiently. After the task had been carried out, Montague would exclaim that it would have been impossible without Newton. Thereafter, the government made the temporary position of the warden, a permanent one.</p>
		<p>Upon taking charge, Newton first gained a thorough understanding of the Mint’s accounting system. His extraordinary skill in ordering and categorising data came to his aid and soon, he proved he was a born administrator.</p>
		<p>To enhance the efficacy and accountability of the five country mints located at Norwich, Chester, York, Exeter and Bristol, Newton appointed deputy officers who would report to the officer at the Tower Mint in London. With Newton’s intervention, the Tower Mint operated from four in the morning until midnight. Three hundred workers worked with a team of fifty horses that turned ten mills. Each of the nine presses struck between 50 and 55 times a minute. The Mint produced up to £100,000 per week initially, which increased to £2,500,000. Newton noted that in a period of two years (1696 – 98) the Mint recoined 6.8 million pounds, which was about twice the amount it had coined during the previous thirty years.</p>
		<p>During Newton’s tenure as controller, Thomas Neale was the master of the Mint. Needless to say, Newton did not get along with him. He complained to the Parliament about Neale’s way of working. In reality, Newton had already started behaving like the master of the Mint. He carried out a thorough investigation of the working and the expenses incurred in running the Mint. He had even considered the cost of a melting pot and the number of times it could be used. He had determined the amount coined by weight, both in gold and silver during 1659–61. This study was as detailed and accurate as his study of the orbits of planets! He had copied existing documents pertinent to this study two or three times over. He was very meticulous in his work; even a minor letter would go through two drafts and two fair copies! He even wrote the report that Neale should have submitted to the government.</p>
		<p>Besides, due to bad decisions on the part of the government most of the silver coins went to goldsmiths for melting! This obviously meant that the face value of the metal was more than the material value.</p>
		<p>Besides the task of recoinage, Newton had to root out counterfeiters. He identified and prosecuted forgers. He made as many as fifty-eight depositions in a span of two months from the Newgate suburb and London prisons. He had a capable assistant, Humphrey Hall, who was provided with a suitable disguise, which enabled him to mingle with the counterfeiters.</p>
		<p>The chief among the counterfeiters was William Chaloner. Newton conducted exhaustive research on him and reported to the Parliament.</p>
		<p><em>A japanner in clothes threadbare, ragged and daubed with colours… turned coiner and in a short time put on the habit of a gentleman</em>.</p>
		<p>Chaloner was very clever and had invented his own method of counterfeiting. He had been successful in cheating the king and the government in many ways. He went to the extent of submitting papers to the Privy Council on the subject of abuses in the Mint and counterfeiting. He offered to improve the coinage and wanted to be appointed as the supervisor of the Mint. Newton played his cards very well and got a warrant issued for Chaloner’s arrest and hired spies to report his movements. He had prepared the case in such a manner that there was no escape for Chaloner. He was convicted for treason. He appealed to the King for clemency. The King himself heard the petition and decided against it. Chaloner and six others were hanged. A triumph of Newton’s investigation.</p>
		<p>Newton was still officially the warden and Neale the Master of the Mint. Newton received a salary of £400 a year and Neale, £500 a year and a share in the profits. During recoinage itself, Neale had earned more than £22000. These facts must have enraged Newton because Neale did nothing himself. He had made Newton and another assistant to do all the work.</p>
		<p>Newton became the official Master of the Mint immediately after Neale’s death on December 23, 1699. He still held his chair at Cambridge. In the first year as Master, he earned an income of £3500 that made his Cambridge income seem petty. A year later, he resigned from his professorship in Cambridge to become a full-fledged civil servant. Newton’s student William Whiston succeeded him and occupied the Lucasian Chair at Trinity College.</p>
		<p>Newton’s income from the Mint varied from year to year. Over the twenty-seven years that he was the Master, his average income was estimated at £1650 a year. There were years when he received no income at all, for instance, between 1703 and 1707, the period of the Spanish succession. His average income though was quite splendid and allowed him a lavish lifestyle in London. However, his mind was never at rest. If work at the Mint did not sufficiently occupy him, he had several other things to ponder over such as perturbations in lunar orbits as mentioned earlier.</p>
		<p>The position as the Master of the Mint earned him a membership in the House of Commons of the British Parliament. In fact, he even contested for a seat in the Parliament in 1701 and was elected. But the Parliament itself was dissolved in 1702; Newton decided not to contest thereafter.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Newton Knighted</span></h2>
			<p>Montague was keen that Newton should contest for a seat in Parliament in the forthcoming election. In 1705, he arranged the Queen’s visit to Cambridge. It was a grand visit with people lining the streets everywhere the Queen went. During this visit, Newton was knighted, not just for his contribution to science but also for the role he played at the Mint. Newton’s social status increased. He was on stage with the queen, and dined with her at Trinity College. Newton made a few visits to Cambridge to solicit votes but he lost the election. He won 115 votes while his opponents won 162 and 182. Newton’s political career was over.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Life of the Mint Master in London</span></h2>
			<p>An account by John Conduitt, husband of Newton’s niece Catherine Barton gives an insight into Newton’s life in London. There was style, there was dignity. The house was well-furnished. There were four landscapes decorating the walls along with twelve Delft plates.</p>
			<p>Westfall gives an inventory – <em>three dishes, three salvers, a coffee pot, two candlesticks (all of silver), forty plates, a full set of silver flatware, about ten dozen glasses and six and a half dozen napkins. </em></p>
			<p>There were also two chamber pots made of silver. His clothes were valued at only £8 3s. However, this inventory was taken much later when he suffered from many old age problems.</p>
			<p>His bed, draperies, curtains, hangings were all crimson, his favourite colour. He owned a coach and a large number of servants, six at the time of his death. He perhaps wanted to avenge for his days as a sizar at Cambridge. He could now afford luxury and he went for it. However, it is said that he abstained from eating meat and lived on vegetables. He once hosted French visitors who complained that he served cheap wine. His accounts show that during a week he ordered goose, turkey and chicken for his kitchen. In fact, at his death, he owed £10 26s 4d to a butcher, while it was only 19s to a fruiter. He owed £7 10s for fifteen barrels of beer suggesting that he was anything but a moderate drinker.</p>
			<p>It is surprising that Newton who belonged to high society in London showed no interest whatsoever in literature or theatre. He told William Stuckeley that he ran out halfway through the only opera he ever attended.</p>
			<p>Though Newton served as the master of the Mint, he was more famous as the professor from Cambridge who had written <em>Principia</em>. By virtue of this fame, many people visited him from all over England and overseas. In 1698, Jacques Cassini visited him and offered him a pension from Louis XIV, which came with an appointment to the Academy of Sciences in France. Newton declined the offer.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Intellectual Work Continues</span></h2>
			<p>Although he was at the peak of his fame, Newton did not give up his studies. In 1690, he was busy tying up loose ends in <em>Principia</em>. He returned to optics in late 1680 after a lapse of nearly twenty years. He wrote a treatise and decided not to publish it.</p>
			<p>Alchemy and theology received little attention when he was busy with <em>Principia</em>. He returned to alchemy in 1690 and Westfall points that he devoted more time to alchemy than to all other interests put together. Newton wrote a paper <em>De Natura Acidorum (On the Nature of Acids), </em>based on his alchemical research and attempted to explain alchemical phenomena in terms of forces in mechanics. It was around 1693 that Newton gave up his passionate study of Alchemy, on which he had built tremendous hope. Among other occurrences, his disappointment with Alchemy could also have contributed to his emotional ailment the same year.</p>
			<p>In 1694, Newton focused his attention on the moon again. He had observed perturbations in the lunar orbit and he sought to explain this phenomenon through his theory of gravitation. Only one person, John Fig. 38 John Flamsteed.Flamsteed (Fig. 38), could provide him the required data. Newton tried to collaborate with him but did not succeed, as they were incompatible in nature and person. Then, Newton tried to team up with Halley for a study of comets. Both these attempts bore no fruit. The Lunar problem surfaced again in 1697. Now, Newton visited Greenwich, where Flamsteed was the Astronomer Royal and the ‘co-operation’ continued. Newton managed to extract some useful data from him.</p>

				</figure>
			<p>Flamsteed had written a paper cataloguing fixed stars and solar tables, slated for publication in 1699 in a journal called Opera, edited by John Wallis. He had inserted in his paper a paragraph regarding Newton’s rectified lunar theory, based on Halley’s observations. Newton pressurised him not to disclose anything about his theory. Flamsteed and Wallis wrote several letters seeking permission in this regard. Newton remained silent for a long time and finally wrote very strongly to Flamsteed,</p>
			<p><em>SIR,</em></p>
			<p><em>Upon hearing occasionally that you had sent a letter to Dr. Wallis aboutthe parallax of the fixed stars to be printed, and what you had mentionedtherein with respect to the theory of the moon, I was concerned to be publiclybrought upon the stage about what, perhaps, will never be fitted for thepublic, and thereby the world put into an expectation of what, perhaps, theyare never like to have. I do not love to be printed on every occasion, much less to be dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things, or to be thought by our own people to be trifling away my time about them, when I should be about the King’s business. And, therefore, I desired Dr. Gregory to write to Dr. Wallis, against printing that clause which related to that theory,and mentioned me about it. You may let the world know, if you please,how well you are stored with observations of all sorts, and what calculationsyou have made towards rectifying the theories of the heavenly motions. But there may be cases wherein your friends should not be published without their leave. And, therefore, I hope you will so order the matter, that I may not on his occasion be brought upon the stage. — I am, your humble servant, </em></p>
			<p class="text-right"><em>IS. NEWTON.”</em></p>
			<p>Flamsteed removed the paragraph.</p>
			<p>However, the row between Newton and Flamsteed did not end here.</p>
			<p>Newton was elected president of the Royal Society in 1703 and the next year he paid a visit to the Greenwich observatory as if to exercise his authority. Another motive that prompted the visit was to collect some more data from Flamsteed to support his Lunar Theory, which he knew was in Flamsteed’s possession.</p>
			<p>Newton forced him to publish his observations (Fig. 39). Flamsteed however was not ready to publish a half-baked paper. He wanted his work to be accurate and precise. But Newton would not relent. He compelled and succeeded in making him write a draft called <em>Historia Britannica Coelestis (British History of the Heavens)</em>. Newton presided over the presentation of the manuscript to the Royal Society and even sought and succeeded in getting the Society’s approval for printing the book. The Society sought funding from Prince George. It elected the prince as a member; the prince approved the funding.</p>

				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig.39 </span>One of the plates from Flamsteed’s Atlas</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>A committee headed by Newton was formed to referee Flamsteed’s work for publication. Newton ensured that the committee rejected the author’s plan of the book and directed him to obtain and present data the way Newton wanted. The Society even granted £180 for the calculators who assisted Flamsteed. The pages went to press. The prince died in 1708 and the work came to a halt. In a fit of rage, Newton ensured that Flamsteed’s name was struck off the register of the Royal Society.</p>
				<p>The two men did not communicate thereafter. Each nursed a grudge. Newton was unhappy that despite all the arm-twisting he failed to lay hands on the data he required; Flamsteed felt that Newton had prevented him from publishing his book according to his own will. Newton engineered the situation with great cunning.</p>
				<p>In 1710, he used his power to urge the Queen to proclaim that the president of the Royal Society and other council members were visitors to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. In 1711, Flamsteed was commanded by the Queen to send the remainder of the material for printing. He replied saying that he required more time to complete his observations. Then, he received a communication not from the Queen but from Newton, which ended thus,</p>
				<p><em>if instead thereof you propose anything else, or make any excuses or unnecessary delays it will be taken for an indirect refusal to comply with her Majesty’s order. Your speedy &#38; direct answer &#38; compliance is expected.</em></p>
				<p>Flamsteed was sure that Newton would not publish his book without manipulating the contents. His work, a result of thirty-five years of toil was now at the mercy of Newton. He could mutilate and twist the contents and presentation. Flamsteed mustered courage and replied.</p>
				<p><em>I have now spent 35 years in composing and work of my catalogue, which may in time be published for the use of her Majesty’s subjects and ingenious men the world over. I have endured long and painful tempers by my night watches and day labours. I have spent a large sum of money above my appointment, out of my own estate, to complete my catalogue and complete my work under my own hands. Do not tease me with banter by telling me yet these alterations are made to please me when you are sensible nothing can be more displeasing nor injurious than to be told so.</em></p>
				<p><em>Make my case your own, and tell me ingenuously and sincerely, were you in my circumstances, and had been at all my labor, charge, and trouble, would you like to have your labors surreptitiously forced out of your hands, conveyed into the hands of your declared, profligate enemies, printed without your consent, and spoiled, as mine are, in the impression? Would you suffer your enemies to make themselves judges of what they really understand not? Would you not withdraw your copy out of their hands, trust no more in theirs, and publish your own works rather at your own expense, than see them spoiled, and yourself laughed at, for suffering it?</em></p>
				<p><em> I will proceed to print the remaining part of the catalogue as fast as my health, and the small help I have, will suffer me. But if you like not this, I shall print it alone, at my own charge, on better paper, and with fairer types than those your present printer uses; for I cannot bear to see my own labors thus spoiled, to the dishonor of the nation. Queen, and people.</em></p>
				<p>Newton was adamant and with Halley’s help completed printing the book in 1712. Now, he undertook to revise his <em>Principia </em>and removed all reference to Flamsteed and even struck out his name on the plates wherever he could. Flamsteed says in his autobiography ‘<em>God forgive him</em>. <em>I do</em>.’</p>
				<p>History took a turn in 1714 when Queen Anne died. Her proclamation regarding the Greenwich observatory was no longer valid. Montague too died. Newton no longer had any royal connections. Somebody in the scheme of things helped Flamsteed procure all the 300 copies of his book that Newton had printed. He burnt them to make way for his own version of the book. When Princess Caroline visited the observatory in 1716, Flamsteed told her that <em>Newton was a rascal who had stolen two stars from him</em>.</p>
				<p>Two of Flamsteed’s assistants published his book as he had wanted it, posthumously. It has been hailed as one of the greatest landmarks in astronomy.</p>
				<p>Newton’s altercation with Flamsteed dented Newton’s image to such an extent that when he or his disciples such as Halley recommended candidates for the chairs at Oxford, none would be selected.</p>
				<p>Newton’s intellectual work continued even as late as 1697, when he was involved with the Mint. The famous French mathematician, Johann Bernoulli, in the journal Acta Eruditorum, challenged the intelligentsia to find the path along which a heavy body will descend more quickly from one point to another that is not directly below it. Stated in scientific terms it becomes - ‘To find the curve connecting two points, at different heights and not on the same vertical line, along which, a body acted upon only by gravity, will fall in the shortest time’.</p>
				<p>He gave a period of six months for an answer. When Bernoulli received no satisfactory reply even after twelve months, he decided to give it a wider circulation. He added a second problem and published it in <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>. Newton was also informed of the problem. Both Bernoulli and Leibniz thought that the problem would baffle Newton and they could establish their supremacy over him.</p>
				<p>Newton took it as a personal challenge. He was busy with the work at the Mint, but was bent on solving the problem.</p>
				<p>Conduitt has written,</p>
				<p><em>When the problem in 1697 was sent by Bernoulli — Sir I.N. was in the midst of the hurry of the great recoinage and did not come home till four from the Tower very much tired, but did not sleep till he had solved it.</em></p>
				<p>Newton sent the answer to Charles Montague, the President of the Royal Society. Bernoulli recognised the author at once <em>as the lion is recognised by his paw</em>.</p>
