		<p>Although Newton presented <em>PRINCIPIA	</em>at the Royal Society and had it published, he took little interest in the institution itself. The most significant reason for his distance from the Society was his animosity with Robert Hooke. Each time Newton presented a paper or proclaimed a discovery, Hooke would declare that he knew it already or had discovered it earlier. Newton, there, chose to remain away from Hooke and from the Society.</p>
		<p>After Hooke’s death in March, 1703 it was assumed that Newton would return to the Society and be elected president. Hooke’s death did bring Newton back to the Royal Society. He was elected president, although not unanimously, and without enthusiasm.</p>
		<p>About the time he became president, the Society’s popularity had soured. Membership had trickled down to half from a good two hundred. Members hardly discussed science during meetings. They were happy to chitchat and make merry.</p>
		<p>The first task at hand for the great natural philosopher was to clean up the Society in the same manner he had cleaned up the Mint. The Society had for a long time been spearheaded by people with political power rather than intellectual brilliance. Many of them were absentee presidents. Montague, a past president had attended one meeting of the council in three years while the preceding president, John Lord Somers, had attended none during his five-year tenure. Newton involved himself actively and attended all the council meetings of the Society (Fig. 40). He missed only three meetings during the next twenty years. The Society that had seen its president three times during the past eight years, now saw him almost on every occasion.</p>

		<p>Newton took the law into his own hands with a commitment to systematise the activities of the Society. He put to good use his administrative powers and skill and the Society revived. He declared that Natural Philosophy,</p>
		<p><em>consists in discovering the frame and operations of Nature, and reducing them, as far as may be, to general rules or laws—establishing these rules by observations and experiments, and thence deducing the causes and effects of things.</em></p>
		<p>Further, he identified five major branches of natural philosophy – mathematics and mechanics, astronomy and optics, zoology, anatomy and physiology, and botany and chemistry. He proposed to appoint, with salaries, four reputed experts in major branches of philosophy (science) to attend the meetings. Their responsibilities included conducting meaningful discussions and keeping members abreast of scientific developments. It may be recalled that Robert Hooke was indeed one such expert and had very effectively done the same job. Newton indirectly acknowledged his enemy, but replaced him with a team. One such member was Francis Hauksbee, who served the Society for nearly ten years, and became a great scientist in his own right. He worked on air pumps, electricity, capillary action, among others. Another member was Dr. James Douglas, who dissected animals for experimentation. Newton also entertained members by telling them about insignificant events such as that of a man who died of drinking brandy and a dog that was killed by Macassar poison!</p>
		<p>With Newton’s proactive participation, the membership of the Society more than doubled and became financially sound. Newton passed new orders for the conduct of the council meetings. Only the president was allowed to sit at the head of the table. The two secretaries sat at the lower end. Members had to address the president first before talking among themselves. The mace, a symbol of authority, was to be placed on the table only during the presence of the president. Else, it was to be placed on its stand. The meetings now discussed serious science. Newton was successful in finding a new building for the Society in Crane Court. During the shifting, a portrait of Robert Hooke went missing. How and why is not hard to guess. Newton schemed its disappearance. Some have even said that Newton personally oversaw the destruction of the only available portrait of his enemy.</p>
