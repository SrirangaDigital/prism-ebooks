		<p>A huge controversy about who invented calculus erupted between Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (born 1646). Although a lawyer, diplomat and philosopher, Leibniz’s first love was mathematics (Fig. 41). A member of the Royal Society, he is credited with building a calculating machine.</p>
		<p>Leibniz claimed that he had invented calculus independent of Newton in 1674. He published his findings in 1684. Though Newton had invented Calculus in 1665–1666, much before Leibniz, he had kept all his work to himself.</p>
		<p>Leibniz’s claim that he had no access to Newton’s work would not stand considering the fact that Leibniz had visited London in 1677 and had met Collins who had showed him the unpublished papers of Newton on calculus. There had been some correspondence between them in 1676, although Newton did not write to Leibniz directly. He communicated through Henry Oldenburg, the then Secretary of the Royal Society.</p>
		<p>In 1691, mathematician David Gregory requested Newton to write about his binomial expansion. Newton responded with a full exposition of his calculus, which he called <em>De Quadrature Curvarum (On the Quadrature of Curves).</em> He did not forget to mention the correspondence he had had with Leibniz. Newton had developed his own notations. For example, Leibniz indicated a Summation as the integral ∫ while for Newton it was a Quadrature denoted by Q (Fig. 42). Again, Newton preferred not to publish the paper fearing criticism.</p>
		<p>Though Newton preferred silence, his self-acclaimed disciple Fatio wanted to speak out. He wrote letters to Huygens and claimed that Newton had developed calculus before Leibniz had even thought about it. Yielding to pressure, Newton published a condensed version of his paper in the magazine <em>Opera </em>(edited by John Wallis). When Leibniz heard of it, he wrote a polite and nervous letter to Newton,</p>

		<p><em>How great I think the debt owed to you, by our knowledge of Mathematics and of all nature, I have acknowledged you even in public when occasion offered. You had given an astonishing development to geometry by your series; but when you published your work, the Principia, you showed that even what is not subject to the received analysis is an open book to you. </em></p>
		<p>Nevertheless, Leibniz did not stop proclaiming his precedence in inventing calculus. Newton ignored at first. Months later, he wrote a polite reply,</p>
		<p><em>I hope indeed that I have written nothing to displease you, and if there is anything that you think deserves censure, please let me know it by letter, since I value friends more highly than mathematical discoveries. </em></p>
		<p>Newton then published a full-length paper in <em>Opera</em>. European mathematicians including Leibniz, Huygens and Johann Bernoulli interpreted this act as a bid on Newton’s part to suppress Leibniz with this publication. Johann Bernoulli opined that Newton had concocted it out of Leibniz’s work. In England, Gregory and others supported Newton. Gregory wrote that it had been fully demonstrated that Leibniz’s calculus reduces to that of Newton's. Wallis wanted to keep the controversy alive. He requested Newton to send all the correspondence on his paper for publication. Months later Newton obliged and included an earlier correspondence of 1673 from Collins to indicate that he already knew the methods in calculus.</p>
		<p>In 1711, when Newton was busy with the revision of <em>Principia </em>with the assistance of Roger Cotes, Hans Slone, the Secretary of the Royal Society, received a letter from Leibniz, asserting his priority over the invention of calculus. Newton was greatly disturbed and distracted.</p>
		<p>It seemed that Newton’s contribution to calculus was known only in England, and of course to Leibniz. Leibniz’s past correspondence with Newton was now made public. Discussions erupted. Fatio stepped in to say,</p>
		<p><em>But I now recognize, based upon the factual evidence that Newton is the first inventor of this calculus, and the earliest by many years; whether Leibniz, the second inventor, may have borrowed anything from him, I should rather leave to the judgment of those who have seen the letters of Newton and his other manuscripts. Neither the silence of the more modest Newton, nor the remitting exertions of Leibniz to claim on every occasion the invention of the calculus for himself, will deceive anyone what examines these records as I have.</em></p>
		<p>Leibniz fought back saying that when he published his work, Newton only had the method of tangents in hand.</p>
		<p>It was against this background that Newton finally published as an appendix, two chapters on calculus in his <em>Opticks </em>in 1704. He claimed that he had invented the method in 1666 itself.</p>
		<p>The facts were that Newton had invented calculus in 1666, but had not published it for quite some time. However, Leibniz had invented the same calculus ten years later but had published it. Who should be given the credit?</p>
		<p>As Westfall observes,</p>
		<p><em>Varignon remarked that the glory of invention was sufficient for both men. If the glory of invention was enough for both, so was the blame for contest</em>.</p>
		<p>Having hidden calculus from his friends and colleagues and the world at large, Newton built a mafia of mathematicians who would support him, come what may. Leibniz perhaps should have acknowledged his communication of 1676 with Newton in the publication. Despite all this, Leibniz never failed to accept that Newton was indeed a great philosopher.</p>
		<p>He said,</p>
		<p><em>that taking mathematicians from the beginning of the world to the time when Sir Isaac lived, what he had done was much the better half; and added that he had consulted all the learned in Europe upon some difficult points without having any satisfaction, and that when he applied to Sir Isaac, he wrote him in answer by the first post, to do so and so, and then he would find it.</em></p>
		<p>It was never difficult for Newton to find people to speak on his behalf. Many <em>flatterers and cryers always </em>flocked around, doing his bidding. This time Newton chose to speak through John Keill. Keill readily wrote the following as an appendix to one of his papers, <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, in 1708,</p>
		<p><em>All of these laws follow from the now highly celebrated arithmetic of fluxions which Mr. Newton, without any doubt, first invented, as anyone who reads his letters published by Wallis can readily determine. ... yet the same arithmetic, under a different name and method of notation, was afterwards, published by Mr. Leibniz in the Acta Eruditorum.</em></p>
		<p>Leibniz did not expect this behaviour from the author of <em>Principia</em> and <em>Opticks</em>. He complained to the Society and wanted Keill to withdraw his accusation and render an apology.</p>
		<p>The society organised a meeting to discuss the letter. The meeting was a farce indeed, with Newton presiding over and the Society directing Keill to write a letter that would establish Newton’s claims!</p>
		<p>Keill took a month and a half to write his letter. During this time, Newton paid little attention to his revision of <em>Principia</em>. The letter was mailed to Leibniz. Though Leibniz knew that Newton was speaking through Keill, he appealed to the Royal Society for justice in 1712. The Society thus appointed a committee. The committee consisted of Newton’s <em>Yes Masters</em> and he called it <em>numerous, skilful and composed of gentlemen of several nations </em>(A minister of the King of Prussia who was in London and was part of the committee, made the committee international!). Three members were included during the last week!</p>
		<p>Newton had done all the groundwork by collecting appropriate papers and correspondence. The committee met and did not bother to call Newton or Leibniz to give any evidence or statement. In reality, Newton carried out all the investigation and even wrote the report, which was made public within six weeks after the committee was appointed.</p>
		<p>Newton passed judgement upon himself that he was the one who invented calculus. Leibniz’s case was dismissed!</p>
		<p>Keill wrote a report, which concluded,</p>
		<p><em>For which reasons we reckon Mr. Newton the first inventor and are of the opinion that Mr. Keill in asserting the same has been in no way injurious to Mr. Leibniz ...</em></p>
		<p>Newton and his disciples, now jubilant, aired their views on Leibniz in a book called <em>Commercium Epistolicum</em>. Newton went to the extent of ridiculing Leibniz over the communication of 1677, with the following words,</p>
		<p><em>Thus the method which he earlier wanted, asked for, received, and understood with difficulty, he discovered forsooth either first or at least by his own effort. </em></p>
		<p>Newton gives the impression that he had helped Leibniz develop his method.</p>
		<p>Angered by <em>Commercium Epistolicum, </em>Leibniz replied anonymously in the form of a pamphlet and distributed it across the Continent. In it, he stressed that he had published his calculus much before Newton and he was certain that Newton had stolen his calculus and claimed it as his own. Discussion followed and Bernoulli and others joined in supporting Leibniz, again anonymously. Bernoulli specifically requested Leibniz not to reveal his name. He wanted to be faithful to Newton from whom he had received favours. The issue was picked up by a journal in the Netherlands where Keill submitted his version of the controversy. While Bernoulli and Wolf argued on Leibniz’s behalf, Keill and De Moivre stood up for Newton. The master too wrote anonymous letters in <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>.</p>
		<p>Now Leibniz began to challenge Newton on philosophical grounds.</p>
		<p>He wrote,</p>
		<p><em>Natural religion itself seems to decay [there] very much ... Sir Isaac Newton and his followers also have a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to them, God Almighty needs to wind up his watch from time to time, otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion. ... I hold that when God works miracles, he does not do it in order to supply the wants of nature, but those of grace. Whoever thinks otherwise must needs have a very mean notion of the wisdom and power of God.</em></p>
		<p>Leibniz died on November 4, 1716. Newton received word of it from his friend in Italy,</p>
		<p>Mr<em>. Leibniz is dead; and the dispute is finished.</em></p>
		<p>Truly, it took another six years before the dispute fizzled out. Cartoons spoofing the great controversy in science history are created even today.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title text-center" epub:type="title"><span class="colour-blue">Catherine Conduitt</span></h2>
			<p>Catherine, born in 1679, was Newton’s niece and came to live with him twenty years before her marriage in 1717 and continued to live with him even after. She was the daughter of Newton’s half-sister Hannah Smith. Her father died in 1693. Newton purchased an annuity for Hannah’s three children in 1695. He stayed in Jermyn Street along with Catherine who was known for her beauty and wit.</p>
			<p>Among the rich and the famous who were attracted to her was Voltaire. He stated,</p>
			<p>I thought in my youth that Newton made his fortune by his merit. I supposed that the Court and the City of London named him Master of the Mint by acclamation. No such thing. Isaac Newton has a very charming niece, Madame Conduitt, who made a conquest of the minister Halifax (Montague). Fluxions and gravitation would have been of no use without a pretty niece.</p>
			<p>Charles Montague the Earl of Halifax was another admirer and lover of Catherine. In his will, he gave away all his jewels and £3000 to Catherine and also purchased an annuity for her. He later bequeathed her another £6500. He also gave her land and buildings. It is estimated that the Earl left her a total estate of about £150,000. Apparently, Catherine was his mistress and they were also secretly married.</p>
			<p>It is curious that Newton allowed this relationship to continue under his nose, in his household. Should he have exercised his intellectual superiority over his niece? Well, his own life had taught him lessons, the chief of them being, to live and let live. Newton could also have let this affair pass since he had received many favours from Montague, including his position at the Mint.</p>
			<p>However, in 1717 Catherine married John Conduitt, a wealthy man who had served as a commissary to the British army in Gibraltar. Newton and Conduitt met at the Society. Conduitt had apparently identified the site of the Roman city Cartiea, built by the Tyrians in the first millennium BC. Newton’s interest in the subject was triggered as he was working on evolving the Chronology of ancient kingdoms (to be discussed later).</p>
			<p>Conduitt and Catherine were wed in a traditional manner. Conduitt’s joy knew no bounds. He was proud and excited to be related to and in the company of such a great man as Newton. He adored and worshipped him. When Conduitt died twenty years later, his plaque mentioned Newton’s name and his greatness.</p>
			<p>Conduitt recorded all his conversations with Newton and many anecdotes from his life.</p>
