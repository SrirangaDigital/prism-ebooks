		<p>February 16, 1704 was a very special day for Newton. He presented his second great work, <em>Opticks</em> (Fig. 43) to the Royal Society.</p>

		<p>Although this treatise had been in the making for quite some time, almost from 1666, true to his style, he hadn’t published it. In 1702, he promised his associates that he would publish his work on light and quadrature soon. Newton’s admirers, John Wallis and David Gregory also encouraged him in this pursuit.</p>
		<p>He explains the reasons for the delay in publication and, why he finally chose this as the opportune moment for its publication.</p>
		<p><em>To avoid being engaged in Disputes about these Matters, I have hitherto delayed the printing, and should still have delayed it, had not the importunity of Friends prevailed upon me. If any other Papers writ on this Subject are got out of my Hands they are imperfect, and were perhaps written before I had tried all the Expertments here set down, and fully satisfied myself about the Laws of Refractions and Composition of Colours. I have here published what I think proper to come abroad, wishing that it may not be translated into another Language without my Consent.</em></p>
		<p>Needless to say, being engaged in disputes is a reference to his dispute with Hooke. Hooke’s death had of course cleared his way and led to the publication of Opticks.</p>
		<p>Opticks describes Newton’s discoveries related to light. It includes his theory about light and its heterogeneity. Newton believed that here too there is action at a distance, similar to gravity in mechanics.</p>
		<p>Opticks differs from Principia on two counts. First, Principia was written in Latin and Opticks in English, with an intent to target a wider audience. (The Latin edition of the book was published in 1706). Second, while Principia, relies on theory and mathematics for its substance, Opticks relies on experimentation and observation. Besides, Opticks has more philosophy than Principia. This too was epoch making and influenced natural philosophy (science) in the eighteenth century.</p>
		<p>Newton spells this out clearly,</p>
		<p><em>My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments.</em></p>
		<p>The two masterpieces together establish Newton as an authority of both theory and experimentation, the two aspects of science.</p>
		<p>Westfall points out that there is nothing new in Opticks. Calculus had been invented thirty years before its publication. Now he was only making a public declaration of it. All that he has written about optics too had been taking shape since 1670. In fact, he had even communicated some parts of it to the Royal Society. So, Opticks is basically a compilation of all his studies and discoveries related to light.</p>
		<p>Opticks is divided into three books.</p>
		<p><strong>Part 1 of Book I</strong> includes eight different definitions of rays of light, refrangibility, angle of incidence, among other concepts. This is followed by eight axioms, which are illustrated and explained. For example, Axiom I says, “The Angles of Reflexion and Refraction, lie in one and the same Plane with the Angle of Incidence.” This is followed by PROPOSITIONS with proofs. PART II of Book I includes more propositions.</p>
		<p><strong>Book II</strong> has four Parts and dwells on the reflection of light, wherein he argues for the particle theory of light.</p>
		<p><em>And this Problem is scarce otherwise to be solved, than by saying, that the which it acts upon the Ray without immediate Contact. For that the parts of Bodies do act upon Light at a distance shall be shewn hereafter.</em></p>
		<p>Newton concludes that both reflection and refraction of light are caused by sulphurous parts contained in the surface of the reflector.</p>
		<p><strong>Book III</strong> discusses diffraction of light. He states that diffraction occurs when light passes through a slit or a small opening or encounters an obstacle in its path. Again, he stresses the concept of action at a distance and suggests the presence of <em>ether </em>to facilitate it. The book concludes with what are called <em>Queries</em>, sixteen in the first English edition and thirty-one in the Latin edition of 1706.</p>
		<p>There was to be a <strong>Book IV</strong>, explaining Newton’s beliefs about the ultimate nature of things. But, even at this stage of his life he feared criticism. When pressurised, he only wrote a page and a half. By the time he published his Latin edition he had shed his fear of criticism and wrote elaborately. The result was the new <em>Queries, </em>thirty-one of them. The Queries are a free expression of his views, which he had desisted from disclosing all this while.</p>
		<p>In the words of Westfall,</p>
		<p><em>on nature of light, nature of bodies, relation of God to the physical universe, presence in nature of the range of forces which furnish activity necessary for the operation of the world and its performance</em>.</p>
		<p>In 1703 another episode like that with Leibniz occurred. A scholar named Dr. George Cheyne had written a book on calculus entitled,<em> The Inverse Method of Fluxions and was looking for a publisher. </em>Through common friends, Cheyne met Newton and showed him his manuscript and requested help. Newton commented that it was not intolerable. Instead of helping him publish it, Newton offered him a bag of money to cancel its publication! Cheyne did not yield. Newton insisted. Disgusted Cheyne withdrew from the Royal Society, gave up natural philosophy altogether and took to medicine. Later, Newton accused Cheyne of stealing content from his manuscript that he had lent to one of his friends.</p>
		<p>It was around the same time that the issue with Leibniz over the priority of invention of calculus was blooming. Newton was quick to react. He hastily appended two chapters on calculus in <em>Opticks, </em>titled<em> Tractus de quadrarura curvarum (A Treatise on the Quadrature of Curves) and Enumeratio linearum terii ordinis (Enumeration of Lines of the Third Order). </em>It may be recollected that Newton had worked on calculus way back in 1660 and 1670 and had included some of its elements in<em> Principia. </em></p>
		<p>In <em>Opticks, </em>Newton also foretells the publishing of an account of the ‘crowns of colours’ that sometimes appears around the sun and the moon. A book called <em>Dioptrica by Huygens published </em>posthumously in 1703 covered the same topic. Newton perhaps wanted to establish that he had done the study independently.</p>
		<p>Newton drew from his extensive studies of many years and pondered over the forces acting in the universe. He concluded that there were two important forces in nature that caused motion. The first was gravity, which was behind large motions. The second force was the one that propelled small motions between particles. He described inertia as a force that enables bodies to persevere in their motion. However, he cautiously stated that although gravity was present, he did not know <em>how</em> it was caused.</p>
		<p>He had stated in the early edition of <em>Opticks</em> that <em>infinite space is the sensorium of God</em>. But later he thought of revising the phrase. So he collected all the unsold copies of the book and cut out the page and inserted the following sentence. <em>Is not Infinite Space the Sensorium of </em><em/><em>a Being incorporeal, living and intelligent, who sees the things themselves intimately and thoroughly perceives them, and comprehends them wholly </em><em/><em>by their immediate presence to himself?</em></p>
		<p>Leibniz happened to lay hands on a copy of <em>Opticks</em> in which this correction had not been made. He used the notion that infinite space is the sensorium of God and picked on Newton.</p>
		<p>In 1717, thirteen years later, Newton published the second edition of <em>Opticks </em>in English with some revisions, and the second edition in Latin was published in 1719. A year later, Pierre Coste’s translation of <em>Opticks</em> in French was published. In 1721 Newton himself brought out the third edition in English.</p>
		<p><em>Principia</em> was closer to his heart than <em>Opticks</em>. He believed that in <em>Principia </em>he had expressed his ideas in a perfect idiom. He undertook its revision with a young member of the Royal Society, Henry Pemberton. The project lasted another two and a half years. Now Newton was past eighty years and incapable of extended concentration or discussion. Unlike the revision of the second edition of <em>Principia</em> with the assistance of Henry Cotes, the revision for the third edition progressed smoothly. It was presented to the Royal Society on March 31, 1726 by Martin Folkes on behalf of Newton, richly bound in Morocco leather. It is said that 1250 copies were printed, 50 among them on fine paper.</p>
