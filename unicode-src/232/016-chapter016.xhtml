		<p>In his old age, Newton concentrated on prophecy, the history of church and chronology. One should note that all through his life, he was more concerned with theology than science; indeed, he wrote about 1.3 million words (some say it is more than 2 million words) on Biblical subjects. These and his other non-scientific writings lay hidden for a long time until they were discovered in 1936 and auctioned off for a meagre sum of £9000. The great economist John Maynard Keynes acquired these in 1942. After reading them, his perspective of Newton changed.</p>
		<p>He writes,</p>
		<p><em>Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonder child to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.</em></p>
		<p>Why did Newton, the consummate scientist, concern himself with theology?</p>
		<p>He says,</p>
		<p><em>I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by men who were inspired. I study the Bible daily. </em></p>
		<p>Yet, this vast legacy was hidden from public view for two centuries until the auction. We must not forget that Newton was very religious from a young age and had listed the sins he had committed as a mark of confession. We have already seen that he was primarily interested in <em>Prisca Sapienta</em> or the Primary Wisdom.</p>
		<p>Newton and his contemporaries believed in the existence of a God; the universe was His making. They believed that <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</em> God had created the universe with a language, which was the code of creation; the language of nature, which humans had to strive to understand. Therefore, it was the duty of natural philosophers to break the code and share the revealed information with the world. Humans had corrupted the perfect order that had existed when the universe began. It was the task of the natural philosophers to trace back and reconstitute that order. Newton also believed that there was a perfect religion, which had to be reconstructed.</p>
		<p>Newton’s first claim was that Catholics and Trinitarians had deliberately corrupted the text of the New Testament. He conducted extensive research and studied the various versions that existed before the text was corrupted. He found that some passages, not found in the Greek manuscripts, had been added. Besides, he believed, the Catholic tradition had given some sort of a guarantee to its authenticity. He was able to pinpoint that Father Jerome (420 to 340 BC) a Latin priest who had translated the Bible into Latin (which came to be known as the <em>Vulgate</em>), was responsible for corrupting the text.</p>
		<p>Newton focussed on the prophecy as explained in the Book of Revelation and the Book of Daniel. He searched for the original prophecy, determined to filter out the corruptions that had been made over centuries. Perhaps, the history of scripture and theology held a clue. It was from this point of view that Newton undertook a study of chronologies of the ancient kingdoms.</p>
		<p>The Revelation of St. John in the New Testament became sacred to Newton. He thought that it held the key to the prophecy and wrote about it in 1670 and continued to write about it until his death. He states that his motto was,</p>
		<p><em>Having searched (and by the grace of God obtained) after knowledge in the prophetic scriptures, I have thought myself bound to communicate it for the benefit of others. ... If they [the prophetic Scriptures] are never to be understood, to what end did God reveal them?</em></p>
		<p>One of the projects he undertook was to predict the date of the Second Coming of Christ. He thus studied all prophecies and verified their fulfilment. Newton was using the scientific method he adopted in natural philosophy. It is interesting that he predicted 2060 for the Second Coming of Christ. His book, <em>Observations upon the Prophecies</em> was published posthumously.</p>
		<p>Newton studied the Bible in as many as six languages and took interest in the religions of Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Middle East. He was determined to find out how each of these cultures had corrupted true religion. He believed that a reconstruction of the primary religion could save the universe.</p>
		<p>Newton firmly believed that all nations had only one religion at first and that it was well appreciated by Pythagoras, Confucius, Socrates and others.</p>
		<p><em>All nations were originally of the Religion comprehended in the Precepts of the sons of Noah, the chief of which were to have one God, &#38; not to alienate his worship, nor prophane his name; to abstein from murder, theft, fornication, &#38; all injuries; not to feed on the flesh or drink the blood of a living animal, but to be mercifull even to bruit beasts; &#38; to set up Courts of justice in all cities &#38; societies for putting these laws in execution</em>.</p>
		<p>As a part of this project, Newton studied the practice of Judaism in ancient times. He took an interest in Solomon, the Jewish king. His temple was believed to have been built on a divine plan and that in it was encoded the laws of nature. It represented the universe itself. Newton learnt Hebrew so as to be able to read the Book of Ezekiel. With this knowledge, he produced a floor plan of the temple (Fig. 44). To Newton, the inner sanctum of the temple represented the cosmos itself and the temple was the <em>pure</em> model. All other temples built later were corrupt and degraded. Restoration of this order was therefore of utmost importance.</p>

		<p>Newton was highly interested in dating events of antiquity and spent many years in his old age evolving a chronology. To deduce the dates of Biblical events, he investigated natural phenomena such as eclipses and the occurrence of comets. The Princess of Wales, Caroline, who heard about the chronology that Newton had developed wished to see it. But Newton was not very keen. However, yielding to pressure he prepared a shorter version of his studies for her. A longer version came to light in 1728, after his death. He dated the voyage of the Argonauts to 936 BC and was able to connect Egyptian history with the events mentioned in the Old Testament. He also traced the birth of civilisation and the evolution of the different forms of worship of various cultures.</p>
		<p>Scholars have questioned whether Newton should have bothered about all of this. Today, his theological findings may not be of any consequence. The scientific discoveries for which he is known have subdued his theological endeavours. Arguing from today’s stand point, all of his theological studies can be rated as glorious tales and fascinating suppositions. However, we should view Newton in the context of his time. People believed in God and scriptures. For him science was similar to alchemy, which in turn was similar to theology.</p>
		<p>He aimed for a holistic view of the universe in which various disciplines merged seamlessly. All study was worth his effort. Perhaps he was right. Perhaps we are wrong to separate theology from science. Perhaps, a holistic view, of the subjective and the objective is the right one.</p>
		<p>Newton has said,</p>
		<p><em>He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God. </em></p>
