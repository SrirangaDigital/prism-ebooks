		<p>By the time Newton turned eighty years of age, all the turmoil he had lived through had ended – the issues with Flamsteed, the fight with Leibniz, smaller fights in the Mint and so on. He now undertook to revise the two masterpieces he had written. He had the satisfaction and pride of knowing that his Natural Philosophy had spread all over Europe, and many European universities were teaching his theories. Voltaire, Algarotti (Venetian philosopher and expert on Newtonianism) and Madame du Châtelet (French mathematician) had done an admirable job of promoting his work. He was, no doubt, the greatest natural philosopher that ever lived. He was determined to lead the life of a true Christian.</p>
		<p>About eight years before his death, he befriended William Stuckeley, a doctor and member of the Royal Society. He also had his roots in Lincolnshire. Like Conduitt, he was engaged in collecting and recording information about Newton. Conduitt and Stuckeley remain the primary sources of information about Newton’s last days.</p>
		<p>Stuckeley reports,</p>
		<p><em>A life Wch was one continued series of labour, patience humility temperance meekness humanity beneficence &#38; piety without any tincture of vice, exhibits an example wch is more universally beneficial &#38; imitable beneficial than theatchievements of a Cesar or the triumphs of an Alexander.</em></p>
		<p>From his writings, we learn that Newton was of middle stature and plump with piercing eyes and gracious aspect. His hair was as white as snow. A lock of his hair has been preserved in the Wren Library of Trinity College along with his walking stick.</p>
		<p>Stuckeley observes,</p>
		<p><em>According to my own observation, tho’. Sr. Isaac was of a very serious, &#38; compos’d frame of mind yet I have often seen him laugh, &#38; that upon moderate occasions. he had in his disposition, a natural pleasantness of temper, &#38; much good nature, very distant from moroseness, attended neither with gayety nor levity. he usd a good many [shrewd] sayings, bordering on joke, &#38; wit. in company he behavd very agreably; courteous, affable, he was easily made to smile, if not to laugh. </em></p>
		<p>Both Conduitt and Stuckeley have noticed that even in his old age Newton was hardly seen idling his time. He was always found with a book and a pen, near his death as well.</p>
		<p>Augustus De Morgan says in his <em>Essays on the Life and Work of Newton,</em></p>
		<p><em>Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, near Grantham, in Lincolnshire, 1642: a weakly and diminutive infant, of whom it is related that, at his birth, he might have found room in a quart mug. He died on March the 20th , 1727, after more than eighty-four years of more than average bodily health and vigour; it is a proper pendant to the story of the quart mug to state that he never lost more than one of his second teeth.”</em></p>
		<p>Prince George II and Princess Catherine became Newton’s special friends and would entertain him for hours. During this period, he developed another fancy he was happy to pose for portraits.</p>
		<p>Very few in his family recognised Newton’s merit as a scientist and thinker. They understood him the least. For them he was only a rich man living in London. Most of them were poor and needed help to carry on with their lives. They depended on Newton who was happy to financially support them. He paid one person money at regular intervals, he bought an annuity for someone else; he stood surety for another person. There is a long list of his beneficiaries. He distributed copies of the Bible. Historians have found a large number of letters requesting Newton’s support. Westfall observes that his fights with Flamsteed and Leibniz were somewhat compensated by his generosity in later years.</p>
		<p>It was at this stage that Newton revealed to at least three people about his <em>apple story</em>. He was engaged in conversations with Conduitt about the cosmos. His very popular quotation could have come into one such conversation.</p>
		<p><em>I don’t know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.</em></p>

		<p>His health began to deteriorate in 1723. His sphincters had grown weak and he had developed urine incontinence. Consequently, his life and eating habits changed. Meat was taboo; vegetables, broth and soup crept into his menu. In 1725, he suffered from a cough and inflammation of the lungs. He could no longer attend meetings of the Royal Society as regularly as he had previously. He moved away to live in Kensington, a suburb of London.</p>
		<p>March 2, 1727. Newton presided over the meeting of the Royal Society for the last time. His cough continued when he went back home. Doctors found a stone in his bladder. Death became imminent. Sweat ran from his face.</p>
		<p>Stuckeley describes,</p>
		<p><em>The pain rose to such a height that the bed under him, and the very room shook with his agonys, to the wonder of those that were present. Such a struggle had his great soul to quit its earthly tabernacle!</em></p>
		<p>Newton died in the early hours of the morning of March 20, 1727. Physician Richard Mead attended him during the last hours. It is said that Newton then confessed to Mead that he was a virgin. Three days later, the Royal Society announced -</p>
		<p><em>March 23rd 1726.</em></p>
		<p>(It may be pointed out that two calendars were in use during his time. According to the old calendar, it was 1726.)</p>
		<p><em>The Chair being vacant by the Death of Sir Isaac Newton there was no meeting this day.</em></p>
		<p>Tributes poured in from every corner. Gazettes announced his death. He was described as the <em>greatest of philosophers, and the glory of the British nation</em>. The Poem, <em>Sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton </em>by James Thomson reached its fifth edition within a year. Conduitt organised Newton’s funeral. Newton’s body was laid to rest at Westminster Abbey. Some of the officials of the Abbey attended the funeral while the Lord Chancellor, two dukes and three earls bore the pall. Many of the members of the Royal Society followed. A monument was erected in 1731.</p>

		<p>Voltaire observed,</p>
		<p><em>He was buried like a king who had done well by his subjects. No scientist before or since has been so revered and interred with such high honour. </em></p>
		<p>The inscription speaks of it all,</p>
		<p><em>H. S. E. ISAACUS NEWTON Eques Auratus, / Qui, animi vi prope divinâ, / Planetarum Motus, Figuras, / Cometarum semitas, Oceanique Aestus. Suâ Mathesi facem praeferente / Primus demonstravit: / Radiorum Lucis dissimilitudines, / Colorumque inde nascentium proprietates, / Quas nemo antea vel suspicatus erat, pervestigavit. / Naturae, Antiquitatis, S. Scripturae, / Sedulus, sagax, fidus Interpres / Dei O. M. Majestatem Philosophiâ asseruit, / Evangelij Simplicitatem Moribus expressit. / Sibi gratulentur Mortales, / Tale tantumque exstitisse / HUMANI GENERIS DECUS. / NAT. XXV DEC. A.D. MDCXLII. OBIIT. XX. MAR. MDCCXXVI</em></p>

		<p><em>Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25th December 1642, and died on 20th March 1726</em>.</p>
		<p>Alexander Pope, the poet, wrote three years later,</p>
		<p><em>Nature, and Nature’s Laws, lay hid in Night. God said, Let Newton be! and All was Light. </em></p>
		<p>Thus ended a great life; one dedicated to the perennial quest for knowledge, one, which was restless throughout, one which would not admit contemporaries’ superiority, one which went any length to establish its supremacy, which, yet gave a new direction to the understanding of the working of the physical world. Einstein may have corrected Newton, but no one has overturned him. There is no reason to.</p>
