		<p>Isaac Newton’s contributions in the fields of Mechanics, Optics and Mathematics are fundamental with far reaching consequences. However, it is not possible to explain all these in a book of this size. We merely outline his major achievements. It is hoped that the reader will be encouraged to read advanced books in science to fully appreciate his work. Newton’s work in optics has already been discussed in detail in Part 1 of the book. In this section, we will discuss his major findings in Mechanics and Mathematics.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Definitions of Terms</h3>
			<p>Newton defined for the first time some of the concepts we use in science and everyday conversation. <em>Principia</em> begins with eight such definitions quoted below.</p>
			<p><strong>a. Mass is defined as,</strong></p>
			<p><em>Quantity of matter [or mass] is a measure of matter that arises from its density and volume jointly.</em></p>
			<p>And thus the formula,</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>mass = density </em>×<em> volume</em></p>
			<p><strong>b. Momentum </strong></p>
			<p><em>The quantity of motion (</em>which is called Momentum today<em>) is the measure of the same arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly</em>.</p>
			<p>And thus the formula,</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>momentum = mass × velocity</em></p>
			<p><strong>c. Inertia</strong></p>
			<p><em>The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting, by which state, whether it be of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line (straight Line).</em></p>
			<p>This definition of Inertia is also Newton’s first law of motion and <em>vis insita</em> or <em>innate force</em> of matter is <em>inertia</em>. Since the first law has important consequences, we will discuss it separately.</p>
			<p><strong>d. Force</strong></p>
			<p><em>its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line. </em></p>
			<p>The following four definitions are specific to centripetal force, a force which makes a body follow a curved path. This force is perpendicular to the direction of motion and is directed towards the centre of the curved path.</p>
			<p>e. <em>A Centripetal Force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre.</em></p>
			<p>f. <em>The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the same, proportional to the efficacy of the cause that propagates it from the centre, through the spaces round about.</em></p>
			<p>g. <em>The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given time.</em></p>
			<p>h. <em>The motive quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the same proportional to the motion, which it generates in a given time.</em></p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Space and Time</h3>
			<p>Newton writes regarding space and time as follows,</p>
			<p><em>Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...</em></p>
			<p><em>Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies: and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space into another: and relative motion, the translation from one relative place into another </em></p>
			<p>Until the arrival of Albert Einstein, two hundred years after, the above statements regarding space and time by Newton remained unchallenged. For Newton, time and space were both absolute. Five minutes for one person are five minutes for anybody else. What is 100 metres for one person is 100 metres for everybody.</p>
			<p>With Albert Einstein’s <em>Special Theory of Relativity</em> (1905) and <em>General Theory of Relativity</em> (1915) this belief in absolute time and space was overturned. He showed that both space and time are relative and depend upon the speed of the observer. However, relativistic effects become important only at high speeds comparable to that of light. At ordinary speeds, Newton’s Laws still govern all motion.</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Newton’s Laws of Motion</h3>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>First Law:</strong></span> Every body continues to be in a state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by an external force.</p>
			<p>This law easily appeals to common sense. An object, say a stone, placed somewhere continues to stay there forever. If it has to move, someone has to ‘move’ it or apply a force. Now consider an object, which is moving along a straight line. If there is no obstruction to its motion, it continues to move in a straight line. If it has to come to rest, a force need be applied. Then arises the question, why then does an object such as a marble moving horizontally on a surface comes to rest by itself? Do not forget that there is resistance to motion or friction due to the surface. This is more pronounced for a grainy surface. In the absence of resistance, a marble rolling on a surface goes on forever.</p>
			<p>You may have already recognised that this is the phenomenon called inertia. Newton did not quite discover this concept. Galileo was well aware of it.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0054.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 48</span> Why should one wear seatbelt</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>We come across inertia in everyday life and experience it. Assume that you are travelling in a bus and you are standing. What happens when the driver applies brakes suddenly? You have a tendency to fall forward. Why? You were moving as the floor of the bus moved. When the brakes were applied, the bus comes to a stop. However, your body, which was moving, continues to move. Hence you tend to fall. You may now realise that this is the reason why passengers and drivers in a car or bus are advised to fasten seat belts (Fig. 48) so as to prevent injury if the bus or car comes to a halt due to an accident or the driver applies brakes suddenly. Your body tends to move forward even though the vehicle has come to rest. Hence the injury.</p>
			<p>Have you ever had coffee while in a moving car? When the car is at rest or moving at a uniform speed, coffee stays in the cup and is unperturbed. What happens when the car is accelerated? Due to acceleration, a force is felt by all parts of the car and the seat in which you are seated. The car and you too accelerate. But coffee does not sense this force. It moves slowly at its original speed and meets your lap! Hence the spill. Similarly when the car is brought to rest by braking, the car and you come to rest. Coffee still moves. It may splash on the windscreen.</p>
			<p>One may perform this well-known experiment to demonstrate inertia. Take a cup or tumbler and put a thin cardboard on top of it as shown in Fig. 49. Then keep a coin on top of the cardboard. Now with your fingers push the cardboard. The cardboard flies off but the coin falls into the tumbler. Why?</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0055.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 49</span> Experiment to demonstrate inertia.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Second Law: </strong></span>The second law can be stated in many ways. It concerns the net force acting upon an object and the acceleration the object undergoes as a consequence.</p>
			<p>And thus the formula,</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>F = ma,</em></p>
			<p>where <strong><em>F</em></strong> is the net force acting upon the object, <strong><em>m</em></strong> is its mass and <strong><em>a</em></strong> is the acceleration. This formula can be used to calculate the motion of solids, liquids and gases.</p>
			<p>In other words, the acceleration produced on an object is directly proportional to the net force. More the force, more the acceleration, less the force less the acceleration. It may be noted that acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the object. For the same force if the mass is doubled, acceleration gets halved. On the other hand, if the mass is halved, acceleration is doubled. The above equation, which must have been formulated after Newton, however does not appear in <em>Principia</em>.</p>
			<p>Suppose you have a small marble and a big stone. If you want to accelerate them to the same level (say 30 <em>cm</em>/s²) then the marble needs a smaller amount of force and the stone needs a larger force. These forces can be quantified. If the marble has a mass of 5 gms and stone 5 kgs then as per the second law (<em>F = ma</em>) the force required will be 5 × 30 and 5000 × 30 dynes or 0.00015 and 0.15 Newtons. On the other hand, when a force of 1 N is applied, the marble and the stone accelerate to 200 m/s² and 200 mm/s²respectively.</p>
			<p>While applying the formula <em>F=ma</em> to calculate motion it is necessary to note that <strong><em>F</em></strong> is the net force required. In any motion friction is necessarily present. Then you will need a force, which can overcome the friction and then accelerate the body. In case of the motion of a motor car, bus or train, the road friction or resistance, has to be overcome. In case of an aeroplane, air resistance or drag has to be overcome.</p>
			<p>Scientists and engineers have been widely using this formula to calculate velocities, drag, efficiencies and a host of other useful information. This formula assists in determining the most ideal shape and size of an aircraft wing, the ideal temperature of gases in an aircraft engine, the quantity of petrol a car might consume to be driven from point A to point B, whether a certain blockage of the artery will be fatal to a patient and many such instances.</p>
			<p><strong>Third Law: </strong>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
			<p>How is it that you are able to stand on the ground without being sucked into it? The answer is simple. You are pushing the ground with a force, which is equal to your weight. That is action. The ground on the other hand pushes you back with the same force. This is reaction. Action and reaction are equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in direction). This is why you are able to stand at one place. Otherwise, you would have gone into the ground. On the other hand, we cannot stand or float in air because air does not exert enough force to counteract our weight.</p>
			<p>When you hit a wall with your hand, you are exerting a force upon the wall and it produces a reaction equal to the force. Hence the injury. One of the best illustrations of the Third Law is an aircraft engine (Fig. 50).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0056.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 50</span> Third Law in action.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The engine is ignited by a mixture of fuel and oxygen. The hot gases thus produced are issued out through a nozzle. This forms the action. As a reaction, a force is produced in the opposite direction, which propels the aircraft forward. A similar action and reaction take place in case of a propeller driven aircraft and rocket propulsion (Fig. 51).</p>

			<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Consequences of Newton’s Law of Gravitation</h3>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Earth’s gravity on Moon’s surface </strong></span></p>
			<p>Newton’s Laws helped us to calculate the force of gravity exerted by the earth or the moon. The distance from the Moon to the centre of the earth is approximately 60 times the radius of the earth. Therefore, the earth’s gravity on the moon should be 60² times less than that on the earth. We know that on earth’s surface, acceleration due to gravity has a value of 9.8 m/s². Hence on the moon its value should be 9.8/60² = 0.0027 m/s². Consequently, the moon comes closer to earth by 1.4 mm in each second of its orbit.</p>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Weight of an object on Moon </strong></span></p>
			<p>How much does an astronaut weigh on the moon? The acceleration due to gravity of the moon on its own surface is smaller and less massive compared to earth, i.e, 1.6 m/s²ˢ (not to be confused with 0.0027m/s²ˢ, which is the value of earth’s gravity on the surface of the moon). Therefore a man who weighs 75 <em>kgs</em> on earth will weigh (75/9.8) × 1.6 = 12.25 kgs on the moon. Note that his mass remains the same.</p>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>How large is earth’s gravity?</strong></span></p>
			<p>According to Newton’s Law, a force of attraction exists between any two objects.</p>
			<p>Let us calculate the magnitude of this force in different situations.</p>
			<p>To begin with, the mass of earth is 6 × 1024 kg; earth causes an acceleration of 9.8 meters/sec²ˢᵉᶜ</p>
			<p>Now consider two mighty objects of mass 10,000 tons (107 kg) separated by 100 meters. The force between them would be (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ × 10⁷ × 10) / (100)² = 0.67 Newtons.</p>
			<p>Applying Newton’s second law of motion, acceleration = force/mass, and thus the acceleration on each would be 6.7 × 10⁻⁸ meters/sec², too tiny to measure.</p>
			<p>Compare this with acceleration due to gravity which is 9.8 m/s².</p>
			<p>Consider a mass m, which is placed on the surface of the earth. What is the force of attraction between it and the earth?</p>
			<p>We have,</p>
			<img src="images/0064.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Then, what is the force exerted by the sun on the same mass? Let the distance between the surface of the earth and the sun as dsun.</p>
			<p>The force is represented as,</p>
			<img src="images/0065.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>The ratio is represented as,</p>
			<img src="images/0066.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
			<p>We have mₛᵤₙ = 2 × 1030 kg and mₑₐᵣₜₕ = 6 × 1024 kg, while dₛᵤₙ = 1.5 × 108 <em>km</em> and Rₑₐᵣₜₕ = 6400 <em>km</em>, thus,</p>
			<img src="images/0067.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Gravitational force on us on earth due to the sun is less than a tenth of a percent of the earth’s gravitational force on us. Now consider two lovers in a room each weighing 60 kgs and 1 m apart. The force between them compared to earth’s gravity is,</p>
			<img src="images/0068.jpg" alt="image" />
						<p>So, the earth loves them far more than they do themselves!</p>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Weight of the earth</strong></span></p>
			<p>Using the same equation the weight of the earth can be calculated. The weight due to any mass <em>m</em> is the force with which the earth attracts that mass.</p>
			<p>Hence,</p>
			<img src="images/0069.jpg" alt="image" />
					<p>Therefore,</p>
			<img src="images/0070.jpg" alt="image" />
					<p>This calculation was first performed by Henry Cavendish (a British scientist famous for his discovery of Hydrogen) in 1798.</p>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>The earth is not a perfect sphere</strong></span></p>
			<p>The world was well aware that the earth was round and not flat. Newton went further and predicted that the earth is not a perfect spheroid but is an oblate spheroid; it is flat at the poles (Fig. 55). Today we know that the earth’s diameter at the equator is about 12,700 <em>km</em>s. But the distance from pole to pole is about 40 <em>km</em>s lesser than this.</p>
			<p>Newton proved that this difference is a consequence of earth’s rotation. The centrifugal force acting at the equator causes a bulge in the shape of the earth. At the poles there is no centrifugal force. If the earth were a solid mass this oblation would not have occurred. But there are viscous fluids within the earth contributing to the flattening at the poles.</p>
			<p>Considering the shape of the earth to be an ellipsoid one can define flattening <em>f</em> as</p>
			<img src="images/0071.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Where a is the semi major axis (in this case the equatorial radius of the earth) and b is the semi minor axis (in this case the polar radius of the earth). Some of the representative values of <em>f</em> are 1/300 (earth), 1/825(earth’s moon), 1/15 (Jupiter), 1/3 to ½ (one of Saturn’s moons Telesto). Lower the denominator more elliptical the object.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0072.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 55</span> Earth an oblate spheroid.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>A team of French and Spanish scientists in 1735 sailed to Peru and Lapland and verified Newton’s calculations regarding earth’s flattening at the poles. The outcome was that Newton’s prediction was correct.</p>
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Tides</strong></span></p>
			<p>Application of the Theory of Gravitation to the formation of tides (Fig. 56) brings out another interesting fact. The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon acting on the oceans, cause tides. However, it is now known that the tide generating force between any object and the ocean is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the two. The sun’s mass is 27 million times larger than that of our moon. The distance between the sun and earth is 149785000 <em>km</em>, while the distance between the moon and the earth is 382835 <em>km</em>.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/0073.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><span class="colour-blue">Fig. 56</span> Tides.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The attractive force between the earth and moon is represented by,</p>
			<img src="images/0074.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>That between the sun and earth is represented by,</p>
			<img src="images/0075.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Their ratio is represented by,</p>
			<img src="images/0076.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Consequently, the sun’s gravitational force is 177 times as powerful as that of the moon upon the earth.</p>
			<p>Now consider the tide producing forces.</p>
			<p>For Fts, Tide generating force exerted by the sun we have,</p>
				<img src="images/0077.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>For Ftₘ, Tide generating force exerted the moon, it is,</p>
			<img src="images/0078.jpg" alt="image" />
					<p>Though the attractive force due to the sun is 177 times than that due to the moon, the tide generating force due to the sun is only 46% of that due to the moon. This difference can of course be explained by the large distance between the sun and the earth.</p>
			<img src="images/0079.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Orbits of satellites </strong></span></p>
			<p>How is it that the moon keeps its orbit around the earth and doesn’t fall off into the earth’s surface or take off in another direction? For that matter, how do the artificial satellites that we send regularly to space keep their orbits? Newton’s famous thought experiment of firing a cannon (Fig. 57) explains the phenomena. Consider a cannon, which is fired from the surface of the earth as shown. For a small speed of firing, such as A, the cannon will fall to the ground after travelling a parabolic path. As the speed of firing increases, say C, the cannon goes further, does not fall back into the earth’s surface, but somewhat follows the curvature of the earth. The canon simply encircles the earth. So, we see that with varying speeds, the cannon follows different trajectories as shown. Newton showed mathematically that if the cannon is fired with a certain speed, it will orbit around the earth and will be within its gravitational field.</p>
			<p>The velocity with which a satellite must revolve in order to orbit at a given height from the earth can also be calculated. While orbiting, the gravitational force due to earth’s attraction, <em>F<small>g</small></em>, is balanced by the centripetal force, <em>F<small>c</small></em>, due to the motion of the satellite as shown in (Fig. 58). Assume that the satellite is at a height <em>h</em> above the earth’s surface. This phenomenon can be expressed thus,</p>
						<img src="images/0080.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>Leading to</p>
				<img src="images/0081.jpg" alt="image" />
			<p>If the velocity of the satellite is less than <em>vs</em> the satellite will fall to the ground. Otherwise, it will keep its orbit. Substituting for <em>G</em>, <em>me</em> and <em>Re</em> as before we obtain, <em>h=0</em>,</p>
			<p><em>Vs = 7.92 km/s</em></p>

			<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Einstein gives a different view</strong></span></p>
			<p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) two hundred years later proposed a different interpretation of gravity. For Newton gravity was a force of attraction between two objects. However, Einstein argued that gravity is the curvature of this space-time continuum. He redefined our conception of space and time. He viewed the world around us as four dimensional (x, y, z, t). While it is easy to imagine in our minds a three dimensional world, to imagine a four-dimensional space is a little tricky. In fact, any number of dimensions can be illustrated mathematically. Such a conception is known as the space-time continuum.</p>
			<p>Let’s imagine the space-time continuum as a mattress. When objects such as planets are placed on it, the mattress becomes curved. The extent and form of curvature depends on the mass and shape of the object. This distortion in the mattress or of the space-time continuum, according to Einstein is gravity.</p>
			<p>Many of Einstein’s predictions have been experimentally verified. One such is that a ray of light bends in a gravitational field.</p>

				<p>How do we calculate the slope of a curve? The slope of a straight line, a particular case of a curve, as the one in Fig. 60 can be calculated accurately with the formula,</p>

				<p>Can we apply the same rule to calculate the slope of a general curve instead? Consider the curve shown in Fig. 61. How do we find the slope of this curve at any point, for instance, <em>C</em>? Imagine that this curve traces the path of a particle in time. In other words, x-axis is the time taken and y-axis is the distance travelled. How do we find the speed of a particle at any given point in time?</p>

				<p>One intuitive idea is to consider distance travelled in a specified time and to divide one by the other. Accordingly, to calculate the slope at point <em>C</em> the formula would be,</p>
				<img src="images/0087.jpg" alt="image" />
				<p>However, we soon realize that this formula helps calculate the slope of line BD and not of the curve.</p>
				<p>Newton solved the problem by taking a large number of points on the curve so that the distance between the points on the curve becomes vanishingly small as shown in Fig. 62. Now that above equation determines the slope of the curve at <em>C</em> more accurately as the points B and D are very close to it. To be exact, mathematicians, easily realise there should be infinite number of divisions. Newton gave an expression to find the slope.</p>
				<p>If the curve is defined by a function,</p>
				<p><em>y = f(x)</em>,</p>
				<p>then, the gradient  <img src="images/0088.jpg" alt="image" /> and this is called the<em>Differential Coefficient </em>and is the slope of the curve at any given point (x, y). The process of obtaining it is called <em>Differentiation</em>.</p>
				<p>If <em>f = x²</em> then <em>f’=2x,</em> if <em>f=x³</em> then<em> f’=3x²</em>, if <em>f = xⁿ,</em> then<em> f’=nxnⁿ⁻¹</em></p>
				<p>For complicated expressions such as <em>f= x³+3sinx,f’ = 3x²+3cosx</em></p>
				<p>Thus one can find <em>f’</em> for any function.</p>
				<p>We can also have<img src="images/0089.jpg" alt="image" />  and other subsequent derivatives depending upon the function, <em>f</em>. </p>
				<p>Applying the theory to mechanics, if <em>f</em> is an expression for the distance travelled by a particle for different times, then <em>f’</em> is its velocity and <em>f’’</em> is its acceleration.</p>

				<p>This is a very simple explanation of Differential Calculus. Complexities occur in practical applications. We also have ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Integral Calculus denotes the reverse of differentiation and helps find the area under a curve. Again, consider a straight line AB as shown in Fig. 63. The area under the curve, which is shaded in the picture, is calculated as the sum of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle.</p>
				<p>How do we find the area if we had a curve instead of a straight line (Fig. 64)? Newton’s method was to divide the area to be calculated into a number of rectangles. The sum of the areas of these rectangles will give an approximate value of the area under the curve. Note that the width of each of the rectangles is Dx. Obviously, if this is kept small, we calculate a better value for the answer. The difference between the correct area and the area we calculate is the sum of unshaded areas in Fig 64. As Dx becomes smaller and smaller the unshaded areas also become smaller and smaller.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>In fact, such a procedure can be carried out even when we do not have an equation for the curve AB. There are many approximations to calculate the area under the curve. Numerous functions are available to perform this operation using a computer.</p>
				<p>If we have an expression for the curve AB, the procedure simplifies and we do not need a computer. We perform an operation, which is the opposite of differentiation, well known as <em>integration</em>.</p>
				<p>Suppose the equation to the curve AB is given by</p>
				<p><em>f = x²</em></p>
				<p>Integrating this expression, we have <em>∫f(x) dx = ∫x² dx = x³/3+ C</em>, where <em>C</em> is the constant of integration.</p>
				<p>Area under the curve AB will be</p>
				<img src="images/0093.jpg" alt="image" />
				<p>For a general <em>f=xⁿ, ∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n + 1) + C</em></p>
				<p>If the curve represents the velocity of a particle at different times, it may be verified that the area under the curve is the distance travelled by the particle from time at A to time at B.</p>
				<p>What we have considered are the simplest examples of differentiation and integration. These become very complex in real life problems encountered in science and engineering. Closed form solutions as the ones we have indicated may not be viable in many situations. Resorting to numerical techniques becomes essential. Computers become handy. Example can be given of calculating the air pressures and speeds around a flying aircraft, forces on a sailing ship, temperatures and pressures in automobile and aircraft engines, flow of air within a large building, blood flow in human arteries and veins and many others. These involve solving what are called Partial Differential Equations and will require enormous computing resources and money.</p>
				<p><strong><span class="colour-blue">Finding roots of an equation</span></strong></p>
				<p>Newton devised a method to find the roots of an equation. Known as Newton’s method it is prevalent even today and has many variations. It is essentially an iterative method and can be illustrated as follows. Consider AB, which is given by a certain equation as shown in Fig. 65. The curve intersects the X–axis at <em>C</em>. Hence, C represents the root of the equation. When the equation is simple, there are methods to solve them and obtain the root. But if the equation is complex there may not be a straight forward procedure. Newton’s method comes to our rescue.</p>
				<p>The method starts with an initial guess. In our case it is <em>x = P₁</em>. Obviously, this is not a good solution. Draw a tangent to the curve at <em>P₁</em>. This intersects the x-axis at <em>Q₁</em>. Draw a vertical here, which hits the curve at <em>P₂</em>. Again, draw a tangent, which hits the x-axis at <em>Q₂</em>. We observe that we are already close to the solution. Repeat the process. We will land very close to <em>C</em>.</p>
				<p>This is a simple description of Newton’s procedure to find the roots. In an algorithmic format, it can be represented as,</p>
				<img src="images/0094.jpg" alt="image" />
				<p>Where <em>n</em> is the present approximation to the root, <em>f(n)</em> is the present value of the function and <em>f’(n)</em> is the value of the gradient at the present approximation, <em>n+1</em> is the improved value of the root or a better approximation. The procedure has to be continued till <em>(xₙ+₁ – xₙ)</em> is below a prescribed tolerance.</p>
				<p>There are many algorithms in literature to carry on Newton’s iteration to find the roots. The method is used even while solving partial differential equations in Fluid Mechanics as well as Solid Mechanics.</p>

				<p>Binomial expansion was known to scientists and mathematicians for a long time. There are references to it in Chinese, Islamic and Hindu scriptures. Even the poet Omar Khayyam is credited with knowing about it. What Newton gave was an expansion of <em>(a+b)ⁿ</em>where <em>n</em> can be positive, negative or a fraction. It reads,</p>
				<img src="images/0096.jpg" alt="image" />
				<p>This is called the Generalised Binomial Theorem. Its applications are many.</p>

				<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Newton’s Law of Cooling</strong></span></p>
				<p>This is a very important aspect of Heat Transfer and has relevance to cooling and heating. Newton showed that the rate of change of temperature of an object is proportional to the difference of temperatures between the object and the ambient. If T is the temperature of the object and Ta, the ambient temperature then,</p>

				<p>where k is a constant.</p>
				<p><span class="colour-blue"><strong>Speed of Sound</strong></span></p>
				<p>In <em>Principia</em>, Newton gave a formula for the speed of sound as,</p>
				<p><em>c</em>=&#8730;E/p</p>
					<p>where E is the Modulus of Elasticity and ρ is the density of the medium.</p>
				<p>By suitable substitution for the terms the above formula reduces to <em>c</em>=&#8730;E/p where p is the pressure of the medium. This is the form that is used in most applications. In aerodynamic and gas dynamic applications one can see that it takes the familiar form,<img src="images/0098.jpg" alt="image" />  where γ is the ratio of specific heats (=1.4 for air), R is the gas constant; T is the temperature in °K.</p>
