		<p>Albert Einstein by Sydney Srinivas is a comprehensive account of the life and times of Einstein, perhaps the greatest intellectual of all times. The book traces the various influences through childhood and adulthood that shaped his scientific temper and culminated in his Theories of Relativity.</p>
		<p>Rather than being just a chronological compilation of the highlights of Einstein’s life, the biography lucidly interweaves the socio-cultural and political ethos of the times. Evoking such a context becomes important in assessing the greatness of Einstein as a path finding physicist and more importantly as a human being with a strong moral fibre who stood for justice at all times. Nevertheless, the author doesn’t resile from touching upon the frailties and weaknesses of Einstein.</p>
		<p>The book delineates Einstein’s all consuming passion for physics, which did take a toll on his family life. The transition from scientist to social and political activist comes alive in the book.</p>
		<p>The inclusion of several interesting anecdotes from his life add colour to the narrative.</p>
		<p>The various theories proposed by Einstein are included in Part 2 of the book. The complex theories are explained in simple style, devoid of complex jargon, making the book an ideal read for students and laymen alike.</p>
