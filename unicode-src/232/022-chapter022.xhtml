		<p>By Sydney Srinivas, (with an introduction to the Mathematics of Ramanujan by Michael D Hirschhorn), published by Prism Books Private Limited, 2012, 13, 15.</p>
		<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a world-class mathematician from India. Born in 1887, in the state of Tamilnadu, India, Ramanujan proved to be a prodigy when still at high school. His extraordinary mathematical powers came to light during his college days. His undivided attention to mathematical study took its toll; he failed his exams and had to give up formal studies. However, he continued to tackle complex mathematical problems in the humble environs of his home. Endowed with extraordinary mathematical insight, he was able to propose, without proof, more than 3000 theorems; highly qualified mathematicians are still trying to prove them.</p>
		<p>Encouraged by his mentors, Ramanujan sent some of his findings to Prof. Hardy of Cambridge University, who at once invited him to be his colleague. They worked together for five years and contributed significantly to <em>Partitions, Continued Fractions </em>and other branches of mathematics . Ramanujan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of Trinity College. However, he was forced to return to India due to ill health. He died when he was only 32.</p>
		<p>In this book, Sydney Srinivas gives an impressive and lucid account of Ramanujan’s life. Apart from many visuals and photographs, it contains numerous anecdotes from a life that oscillated between agony and ecstasy. The author traces Ramanujan’s childhood, through his student days and as a clerk at the Madras port and his struggles in England. The great influence of his mother Komalathammal in his life is clearly evoked.</p>
		<p>A special feature of the book is the short introduction by Dr Hrischhorn, an eminent Ramanujan scholar, to Taxicab Numbers, Partition Numbers and Continued Fraction, some of the complex mathematical problems that Ramanujan tackled.</p>
