		<p><em>I saw the movie THE MAN WHO KNEW INFINITY. Then I re-read your book. The English film-makers sugar-coated it somewhat. I learnt a lot more about Ramanujan from your short biography of him. What a sad story and what an amazing genius. Thanks for writing it. </em>Tom Cowan, Cinema Director and Producer and the photographer for the Kannada movie-<em>Samskara</em>.</p>
		<p><em>Thanks for your lovely slim volume on the great mathematician, Ramanujan. I have dipped into it, and it looks wonderful.</em> Karl S. Kruszelnicki, Science presenter and writer.</p>
		<p><em>I found your book very interesting indeed – I enjoyed it and I learned a lot. I learned much about Ramanujan, and his times.  It made the film about Ramanujan much more real.  I also enjoyed reading Michael Hirschhorn’s appendix which made the possible derivation of some of Ramanujan’s formulae come alive. Thank you for sharing your work with me. I very much appreciate it</em>. Cheryl Praeger, Professor of Mathematics, University of Western Australia.</p>
