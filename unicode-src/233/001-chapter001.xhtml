		<h1 class="level1-title text-center" epub:type="title">Princes of Ayodhya</h1>
		<img src="images/013_Text_img_0.jpg" alt="logo" />
		<p>The kingdom of Kosala, stretched along the banks of the Sarayu River. Nourished by the waters of the Sarayu, the land was rich with fruit orchards and emerald green plants hosting a myriad of brightly colored flowers. Its granaries were brimming with abundant grains and its coffers were ever full. The kingdom of plenty experienced no want. Its capital Ayodhya was fringed by the river on all sides except the south. The fortified city of exceptional splendor was designed by Vaivaswata Manu, ruler of the Solar Dynasty.</p>
		<p>Dasharatha, the illustrious ruler of Kosala was a descendent of Ikshvaku, Manu’s eldest son. He was well versed in the Vedas and was known for his sagacity and benevolence. The monarch was just as famed for his skills in administration as for his expertise in the art of warfare. He enhanced his administrative prowess with assistance from an able council of ministers who oversaw the safety and security of their king and kingdom.</p>
		<p>Kosala prospered under Dasharatha and its people lived in joy, harmony and peace. A single factor marred the king’s happiness. Dasharatha and his three wives, Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi were saddened by the absence of a progeny to carry on his lineage. In consultation with family, elders and learned sages, the king decided to perform a or fire sacrifice to beget offspring.</p>
		<p>The sacrificial ground was identified and appropriately prepared on the northern bank of the Sarayu. The assembled sages, scholars and priests, under the direction of the great sage, Rishyashringa, chanted mantras and poured offerings into the sacred fire.</p>
		<p>The devas who had congregated to participate in the yajna, made use of this opportunity to seek Lord Vishnu’s help in dealing with Ravana, the lord of Lanka. The rakshasa king had terrorized them and made their lives miserable. Ravana who had once performed severe austerities to please Brahma, obtained a boon from him that made him invincible against all gods, celestial beings, yakshas and ogres. Emboldened by the boon, he struck terror in all the three worlds and harassed the devas.</p>
		<p>The devas now turned to Vishnu and begged him to save them. Lord Vishnu responded to their pleas and vowed to be born on earth, as a human being. For, in his arrogance Ravana had sought no protection against ordinary mortals. And what better opportunity to fulfill his pledge than the one present now, when the illustrious Dasharatha was praying for a son!</p>
		<p>The atmosphere reverberated with the powerful chanting of mantras, and resonated with the melody of musical instruments. Suddenly, a figure resplendent in all glory, arose from the sacrificial flame. The radiant form, held out a bowl of <em>payasam</em> and addressed Dasharatha: “Distribute this divine <em>payasam</em> that has been especially prepared by the god, to your wives. Rest assured that in due course you will be blessed with four strong, pious and powerful sons.”</p>
		<p>Dasharatha who was overjoyed on hearing this, bowed reverentially before the figure and circumambulated it. He handed over the <em>payasam</em> to his three wives.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Birth of the princes</h2>
			<p>The following spring, Ayodhya welcomed with jubilation, the birth of four princes of the Ikshvaku dynasty. Dasharatha beamed with pride and delight as he admired his four sons, Rama, whom Kausalya held close to her bosom, Bharata, the son born of his favourite queen Kaikeyi and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrugna nursed by their mother Sumitra. The king marked the auspicious event by making generous gifts of gold, jewels, cows and other forms of wealth to the dancers, musicians, bards and priests.</p>
			<p>The princes grew up in an atmosphere of love and care. A special bond developed between Rama and Lakshmana as did deep affection and companionship between Bharata and Shatrugna. The youngsters were initiated to formal education under Vasishta at his hermitage. The princes delighted in the pastoral environs of the ashram. They thrilled at the kinks of green pasture, dotted with young lambs and deer, alongside the rivulets. They enjoyed the enchanting chirping of birds from their perch on fruit and flower laden trees. They took pleasure in the interesting and amiable interactions they had with other pupils in the Gurukula.</p>
			<p>The brothers received training in various aspects of life as befitting imperials. They became proficient in the Vedas, mastered the art of using weapons and absorbed every form of learning under the shrewd guidance of Vasishta. Their learnings made them modest and humble and they endeared themselves to the citizens of Kosala.</p>
			<p>Once their training was complete, Dasharatha contemplated the princes’ wedding, in consultation with his family priests and other elders.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.2">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vishwamitra</h2>
			<p>It was at that opportune moment that the great sage Vishwamitra arrived at Dasharatha’s court. The king greeted him with due courtesy and expressed pleasure at having his esteemed presence in their midst. Vishwamitra who was pleased with the hospitality shown to him, immediately communicated to Dasharatha the reason for his visit. He asked Dasharatha to allow prince Rama accompany him to his hermitage to fight Maricha and Subahu, demons who threatened to destroy a yajna the rishi was performing.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha became apprehensive of his young Rama facing danger from the demons. He was therefore reluctant to accede to Vishwamitra’s request. However, he humbly said: “Why Rama, he is barely sixteen! How will he be able to combat the seasoned demons you mention? Oh learned seer, along with my extremely experienced and valiant army, I will myself guard your sacrifice and oversee its success by dealing with these ogres.”</p>
			<p>Vishwamitra was insistent on taking Rama with him. He further elaborated his cause to the king. “Mareecha and Subahu fight on behalf of the fearful demon Ravana, the son of sage Visrava and half-brother of Kubera. It is at his behest that these two rakshasas hinder my yajna.”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha was terrified at the very idea of exposing Rama to demons from Ravana’s army. He was firm in his resolve to protect his dear son. He appealed to Vishwamitra saying, “When I myself have been unable to fend off the vile and violent Ravana, how will my tender Rama, who I begot after so much <em>tapas</em>, confront his lot! I will accompany my army and encounter the demons sent by Ravana. Please spare my child Rama!”</p>
			<p>The seer who radiated effulgence was known and feared for his fiery temper. Anger welled up in him as he heard Dasharatha. The ever wise Vasishta quickly intercepted and diffused the situation. He advised Dasharatha to send Rama with Vishwamitra by extolling the virtues, skills and superior learning of the rishi. “There is none on earth who is more knowledgeable in the use of various missiles as Vishwamitra. He is an epitome of dharma and is endowed with the power to see the past and divine the future. Though capable of dealing with the ogres himself, it is for Rama’s good that he implores you to send him. This will be a good learning experience for the prince. Being protected by Vishwamitra, Rama will come to no harm from the demons.”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha felt reassured by Vasishta’s words. He consented to send Rama with Vishwamitra. Rama’s constant companion and shadow Lakshmana, joined his brother on the mission. Flowers rained from the heavens upon Dasharatha’s sons as they walked step for step alongside Vishwamitra with bows and a quiver full of arrows slung over their shoulders. Their eyes glinted with excitement as they marched, looking forward to accomplish the task set them by the great sage. They walked along the southern bank of the Sarayu and paid their homage to the river.</p>
			<p>As the sun went down over the Sarayu, a pastel peach bled into lilac at the horizon. Vishwamitra decided to break journey on the river bank for the night. Following the evening ablutions, the sage initiated Rama and Lakshmana to two potent mantras, ‘Bala’ and ‘Atibala’. “As long as you chant these twin mantras, you will be matchless, invincible against any evil force, in sleep and wakefulness. They will protect you from fatigue, every kind of malady and keep you ever youthful,” Vishwamitra explained to them.</p>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana felt happy at having learnt something new. They retired for the day after crafting their beds from straw and dry leaves. As the first stars emerged on a dusky sky, they fell into a well of blissful sleep.</p>
			<p>The brothers continued their journey with Vishwamitra the following morning after offering their obeisance to various deities and chanting the Gayatri mantra. All through their way to the sage’s ashram, the great seer regaled them with stories galore. Towards evening they came upon the magnificent sight of the confluence of the Ganga and Sarayu. They were enamoured of this spectacular vista and decided to spend their night here.</p>
			<p>The trio resumed the passage to their destination the following day. They had to cross the Ganga in order to reach Vishwamitra’s ashram. When they reached mid river, the waters turned turbulent with thrashing waves. A tumultuous roar was caused by the gushing waters of the Sarayu as it merged with the river Ganga, known here as river Jahnavi. The princes were amused to hear from Vishwamitra that Ganga was once swallowed in entirety by sage Jahnu because she had inundated his sacrificial ground; later he released her through his ears. She then earned the name Jahnavi, daughter of Jahnu!</p>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana followed Vishwamitra into the dense Dandaka forest after crossing the Ganga. The forest, bereft of proper trails was difficult to negotiate. It was ridden with wild beasts and birds of prey, and filled with a cacophony of terrible, eerie sounds. The jungle was once a prosperous territory, home to the kingdoms of Malada and Karusa.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.3">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Tataka</h2>
			<p>With the passage of time, the prosperous land of Dandaka came to be inhabited by Tataka, a yaksha woman who could assume any form at will. She was born, endowed with the vigour of a thousand elephants. This was because of a boon granted by Brahma to Suketu, her father who begot her after performing severe austerities. When she came of marriageable age, Tataka wed Sunda, the son of demon Jambha. Mareecha was born from the union of Tataka and Sunda. However, when Sunda died because of a curse by sage Agasthya, Tataka sought revenge. When she once spotted the sage, she charged towards him, along with her son Mareecha, to devour him. Agasthya cursed Mareecha to become transformed into an ogre. He then turned to Tataka and said, “May you turn into a hideous man-eating ogre and shed all the goodness associated with a yaksha woman!”</p>
			<p>Tataka turned into a cannibal due to Agasthya’s curse. She wrecked havoc on Dandaka region and laid waste, an area that was once a place of sylvan beauty.</p>
			<p>As they wove their way through Dandaka, Vishwamitra alerted the brothers to be prepared to face the fury of Tataka. Rama rose to the occasion. He strung the bow and twanged it. The entire forest shook and throbbed at the sound caused by the stringing of the bow. Tataka who was now provoked, charged at them, raising a cloud of dust. As Rama hesitated to shoot at a woman, Vishwamitra urged him, “Rama, as a kshatriya and an upholder of dharma, it is your duty to annihilate the dark forces that are a menace to society. By killing Tataka and her army, you will restore Dandaka to its former glory and make it peaceful, prosperous and livable once again.”</p>
			<p>A fierce fight followed between Rama, Lakshmana and Tataka. She greeted the scions of Ishvaku with showers of rocks. The princes parried these with counter showers. When the demon rushed towards Rama, he chopped off her arms while Lakshmana severed her ears and sliced the tip of her nose. Tataka then made herself invisible and rained stones on the brothers. Rama who was skilled at hitting invisible targets merely by hearing their sounds, made short of his work. His arrow pierced Tataka. She fell down, vanquished.</p>
			<p>A crescent moon, graceful and tantalizing as a lady’s eyebrow, glowed over Dandaka. It regained its lost glory.</p>
			<p>As innumerable stars graced the night sky and the moon bathed Dandaka in its mellow light, Rama and Lakshmana slept, happy to have accomplished yet another feat.</p>
			<p>A fragrant dawn breeze gently caressed the brothers and roused them from slumber. Vishwamitra was pleased with the princes for the indomitable courage they had displayed against Tataka, who they killed. He rewarded them by imparting to them knowledge of celestial missiles.</p>
			<p>Before they progressed to the last stretch of their journey towards Vishwamitra’s ashram, the sage gifted the princes, missiles that could immobilse the enemy, strike at any target, influence the weather and natural phenomena. Vishwamitra also instructed them on how to invoke, use and recall the various weapons.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.4">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Siddhashrama</h2>
			<p>The three of them finally reached Siddhashrama, Vishwamitra’s hermitage, where Vishnu had once sat in meditation. Once at the ashram, Vishwamitra began to make serious preparations for the yajna.</p>
			<p>The sacrifice was performed day and night over a period of six days while Rama and Lakshmana kept strict vigil at the venue. On the sixth day, as the sacrificial fire blazed at the altar, a loud and fearful uproar rent asunder the air. Dense dark clouds swiftly wafted across the sky, eclipsing the sun. The heavens, space and earth appeared devoid of light. Subahu and Mareecha lunged towards the altar where the yajna was in progress, ready to rain down a deluge of filth. Rama and Lakshmana stopped them in mid air. As Lakshmana was all set to use one of the most potent missiles on Mareecha, Rama advised him against it. He said, “It is not yet time for him to depart from this world. Hence, do not kill him.”</p>
			<p>Rama then hurled a weapon that struck Mareecha’s breast. It did not kill him, but flung him far into the deep ocean and rendered him senseless. Once they dispensed with Mareecha, Rama and Lakshmana slayed Subahu and the rest of the rakshasas who threatened to interrupt the yajna.</p>
			<p>Vishwamitra effusively praised Rama and Lakshmana for helping him to successfully conclude the yajna. The erudite assembly of rishis who participated in the sacrifice, applauded Rama. They suggested to Vishwamitra that the brothers accompany their entourage to the kingdom of Videha to witness the sacrifice performed by King Janaka. Vishwamitra concurred with the rishis and embarked on the journey to Mithila, the capital of Videha.</p>
			<p>The hermits who began their journey from Siddhashrama to Mithila, stopped to rest on the banks of the Sona for the night. After performing the daily evening worship, they sat down around Vishwamitra under a tree. Rama, enamoured of his surrounds, expressed his desire to know of its origins.</p>
			<p>Vishwamitra began to narrate the story of Siddhashrama. “Several ages ago, the region was ruled by royal sage Kusanabha who performed penance to beget a son. The sacrament bore fruit. My father, the extremely pious Gadhi, was born. Since I hail from the line of Kusa, I am known as Kausika,” explained Vishwamitra.</p>
			<p>Vishwamitra continued his story and told him that he had a sister by name Satyawati who ascended to heaven after leading a virtuous life. She later turned into the sacred river Kausiki, ‘Kosi’ of modern times, flowing by the side of the Himalayas.</p>
			<p>They were well into the night when Vishwamitra concluded his story. With miles to go the next day, the retinue dropped into a well of sleep.</p>
			<p>Rama and the rishis woke up early the following morning, and were greeted by the spectacular sight of River Sona which shone like a glittering sheet of glass. A thin veil of mist wove sinuous patterns on its surface even as the rising giant cast its shimmering glow on its waters. After taking a dip in the river and worshiping the Sun god, the group of men crossed the river and once again entered the forests. As they traversed the jungle trail, the woods reverberated with the joyous cries of a myriad birds swooping and soaring in salute to daybreak. Once again, the rishis came in sight of the Ganga, coursing a long route through the three worlds, negotiating winding pathways through mountains and valleys.</p>
			<p>When Rama urged him, Vishwamitra briefly recounted the story of Ganga. Ganga was the daughter of Himavan, the presiding deity of the mighty Himalayas. In order to ensure welfare of the gods who approached him for securing their wellbeing, Himavan gave Ganga to them. Ganga followed a three-course path and first entered the realms of heaven where she was worshipped as Mandakini.</p>
			<p>Sagara, a king of Ayodhya and an ancestor of Rama once undertook to perform a sacrifice to propitiate the gods. Unfortunately, he could not bring the yajna to fruition as Indra stole the sacrificial horse. Sagara’s sixty thousand sons who went in search of the horse to the subterranean region incurred the wrath of sage Kapila, upon which they turned into mounds of ash. Bhageeratha, the fifth generation of Ikshvaku kings from Sagara, accomplished the task of bringing Ganga down from heaven to wash the ash mounds of Sagara’s sons and liberate them from their sins. Thus, Ganga, brought down to earth by Bhagiratha, came to be known as Bhagirathi.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ahalya</h2>
			<p>As Vishwamitra’s retinue approached the outskirts of Mithila, they came upon an abandoned ashram. The whispering breeze and the breathtaking sylvan forests made it appear like a resort in paradise. The hermitage belonged to sage Gautama who lived here in peace and joy with his wife, the pious Ahalya. Once when the rishi was away from his dwelling, Indra appeared before Ahalya in the guise of her husband Gautama. Ahalya who lost her equanimity for a few fleeting moments, succumbed to his embrace.</p>
			<p>Indra who had accomplished the purpose for which he had come, wanted to leave before Gautama returned. Unfortunately for him, Gautama entered his cottage just then and seeing Indra in his guise and guilty of misdemeanor, cursed him. Gautama also cursed his wife Ahalya to become invisible, live on air and continue residing in the ashram without food or water. He then informed her that she would be redeemed from the curse when Rama, the glorious prince of Ayodhya and son of Dasaratha would set foot in their hermitage. Gautama himself, then left for the Himalayas to perform greater austerities.</p>
			<p>“Rama, please enter the sacred abode of sage Gautama, for it is now time for Devi Ahalya to be liberated from the curse,” said Vishwamitra.</p>
			<p>As soon as Rama stepped into the ashram, there was a sudden flash of brightness. Ahalya appeared before them, looking divinely radiant and beautiful. At the same instant, Gautama also returned from the Himalayas. Rama and Lakshmana took the blessings of Ahalya and Gautama before leaving for Mithila.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.6">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Mithila</h2>
			<p>When Vishwamitra entered Mithila with Rama and Lakshmana, its streets were abundantly adorned and preparations for the sacrifice were in full swing. King Janaka, along with his family priest Satananda, the son of Gautama Rishi and Ahalya, welcomed Vishwamitra with due honours.</p>
			<p>Satananda made eager enquiries about the his parents’ welfare. He was overcome with joy when he heard from Vishwamitra that his parents were united.</p>
			<p>Satananda then turned his attention to Rama and the rest of the guests. He extolled the virtues of Vishwamitra and related incidents from his inspiring life. Vishwamitra was born a Kshatriya and began his political life as a mighty ruler. However, he soon tired of this living and turned to perform tapas and austerities. He sought, and earned the coveted honour of being called “Brahmarishi”, a title that had hitherto been bestowed only upon sage Vasishta.</p>
			<p>When Trisanku, the former king of Ayodhya had wanted to perform a sacrifice so that he could bodily ascend heaven, it was Vishwamitra who helped him achieve this. As the yajna progressed, Trisanku’s ascent to heaven at the sage’s command, halted midway by a counter command from Indra. Vishwamitra then created a new galaxy with a group of seven constellations around Trisanku. All the gods concurred, and Trisanku enjoyed heavenly bliss, amidst brilliantly shining stars.</p>
			<p>On another occasion, when Vishwamitra’s nephew Sunahsepa was tied to a sacrificial pole at a yajna performed by King Ambarisha, the sage taught him mantras to glorify Indra and Vishnu. “Son, chant these mantras. They will deliver you from death and bestow upon you a long life. At the same time, Ambarisha will also get the fruit of his sacrifice by the grace of Indra and Vishnu.”</p>
			<p>True to Vishwamitra’s words, both Sunahsepa and Ambarisha attained their respective goals.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.7">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Shiva’s bow</h2>
			<p>Rama and Lakshmana were as keen to know about the origins of the extraordinary bow in Janaka’s court, as they were eager to see it. Janaka gave them a lucid account of the its presence in Mithila.</p>
			<p>The devas gave Janaka, <em>Pinaka, </em>the divine bow of supreme strength and effulgence. It originally belonged to Shiva, who obtained it as a reward for austerities he had undertaken. It was now displayed regally as an object of worship in King Janaka’s palace.</p>
			<p>King Janaka once desired to perform a yajna. In preparation for the event, he identified an appropriate tract of land. He was ready to plough the plot after observing the associated rites and traditions. Just as he made to dig the earth, he was amazed to see an infant girl lying there in the furrow. When the child heard voices, she gurgled and flashed a beaming smile at Janaka. The king who was irresistibly drawn to the child, picked her up and cradled her in his arms. The monarch and his consort, queen Sunayana, who had no issue, were overjoyed and adopted the baby as their own daughter. They named her ‘Sita’, meaning ‘furrow’ in Sanskrit, for the plough trench where she was discovered. Infant Sita brought, fortune to her foster parents. They were soon blessed with their own daughter, Urmila. The sisters grew up in an atmosphere of love, learning and devotion.</p>
			<p>When Sita reached adulthood, Janaka sought to have her betrothed and wedded to a groom, compact of all virtues and valour. Several prospective kings and princes sought her hand in marriage. But none was good enough for his Sita. Janaka then placed a condition that Sita would marry the suitor who would string <em>Pinaka, </em>the celestial bow in his possession. Many rulers and princes tried their hands at the bow, to no avail.</p>
			<p>The bow was yet unstrung when Vishwamitra arrived at Mithila. The sage asked King Janaka to present it before the sons of Dasharatha. Janaka proudly did so. <em>Pinaka,</em> draped in all finery, looked magnificent in its iron chest which was mounted on eight wheels. A few hundreds of men dragged the chest to the king’s centre court for Rama to see.</p>
			<p>Janaka was skeptical about Rama’s ability to handle the bow. He addressed Vishwamitra most humbly and respectfully: “Neither gods nor gandharvas, kinnaras, nor yakshas, nagas nor demons, have been able to string this bow. How will a mere mortal as young as Rama be able, even to budge it?”</p>
			<p>Vishwamitra, upon hearing Janaka’s words, asked Rama to step forward and display his prowess with the bow. Rama strode gallantly towards the chest, and gently but firmly opened it. As he stood before it, mesmerized by its bewitching majesty, the bow appeared to beckon him. There was a hushed silence in the court. Those assembled, waited with bated breath in anticipation. In a single swift, and easy movement, Rama lifted Pinaka. By the mere alchemy of his touch, the bow was not only strung, but it bent and broke in two! The hall echoed with the thunderous sound of the breaking bow. The earth appeared to tremble at the enormity of this feat. A mere lad had performed the impossible. There was loud cheering and applause as Janaka declared Rama as his daughter’s groom.</p>
			<p>Janaka then dispatched messengers to Ayodhya to acquaint Dasharatha with the happenings at Mithila. He invited the king of Ayodhya to Mithila to solemnize the wedding of Rama and Sita.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.8">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The marriage</h2>
			<p>Dasharatha was ecstatic with the tidings he received from Janaka. Dasharatha, after consulting Vasishta and other sages, prepared to leave for Mithila. Ayodhya was agog with the news of Rama’s forthcoming wedding to Sita. The infectious spirit of joy spread rapidly across the city which already wore a festive look.</p>
			<p>At daybreak on the following day, Dasharatha, with his queens, Bharata and Shatrugna left for Mithila. A large entourage of sages, counselors, ministers, family and friends, followed him.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha and his entourage, were warmly welcomed by Janaka. He and his people were comfortably settled for their stay. The wedding ceremony lasted four days. It began with the introduction of the bride’s and groom’s lineage. Vasishta narrated the family genealogy on behalf of Dasharatha, while Janaka himself recounted his pedigree. Dasharatha, through Vasishta, also solicited Urmila’s hand for Lakshmana. Janaka was overjoyed to have Lakshmana as the groom for his younger daughter. At the same time, Vasishta and Viswamitra, on behalf of Dasharatha sought Janaka’s nieces as life partners for Bharata and Shatrugna. Mandavi and Srutakirti were daughters of Kusadhwaja, the younger brother of King Janaka. The prospect of four wedding celebrations taking place simultaneously caused much jubilation amongst those gathered.</p>
			<p>Mithila witnessed a flurry of activity. A grand pavilion was erected for the wedding ceremony. It was draped in a mélange of silk fabric, studded with glistening pearls and gems. Fragrant floral streamers and buntings adorned its pillars and walls. The sweet smell of incense wafted through the air. The vast arena pulsated with excitement as kings and their deputies gathered from various regions of Bharata Varsha. Vedic hymns and chants were recited even as music from an orchestra of instruments added melody to the mirthful atmosphere that prevailed. Gleeful shouts of “Glory to Rama, Glory to Sita” reverberated through the city of Mithila.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha approached the sacrificial fire with his four sons. Bejeweled and attired in silken robes, they looked resplendent. When the princes were seated, Sita, followed by her sisters arrived at the pavilion. Sita of slender waist and long black tresses, walked daintily to the dais, her face shining with the luminosity of the moon. Her sparkling eyes danced with joy as she cast secretive looks at Rama. Her sharp features glistened with the brilliant luster of gems. She needed no adornments to accentuate her beauty. Yet, the ornaments of gold, embedded with diamonds and other precious stones that she sported, enhanced her naturally pretty looks.</p>
			<p>Dasharatha’s sons were captivated by the beauty of their spouses-to-be who looked no less than heavenly beings. The couples, one by one, walked, hand in hand around the ceremonial fire. They took their vows to be man and wife, pledging their togetherness under every circumstance that life would expose them to. The divine beings from heaven, who watched the marriages from above, showered flowers upon the newly-weds.</p>
			<p>Following the nuptials, Dasharatha took leave of Janaka and proceeded to return to Ayodhya with his people. Simultaneously, sage Vishwamitra too returned to his hermitage.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-1.9">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Parashurama</h2>
			<p>As they were returning to Ayodhya, Dasharatha was overcome by a sense of unease because of the ominous signs he perceived. He expressed his concerns to Vasishta who allayed his fears. All of a sudden, dark clouds blanketed the sky and there was a deafening sound. A terrifying tempest uprooted trees and sent wild beasts running amok in bewilderment. Even as Dasharatha and his ministers wondered at nature’s sudden fury, an enormous cloud of dust rose, and from it Parashurama emerged. This son of Jamadagni rishi, who looked as fearsome and threatening as ever, blocked their path.</p>
			<p>Jamadagni had been unjustly killed by Kartavirya Arjuna, the Kshatriya king with thousand arms. Since then, Parashurama considered all kshatriyas as his enemies. He wiped out the entire clan that he held responsible for his father’s brutal and untimely demise. Once Parashurama vanquished all the kings and established his supremacy over them, he retired to the forests of Mount Mahendra to atone for his sins. Now, upon hearing of Rama’s prowess with the <em>Pinaka, </em>Parasurama rushed from Mount Mahendra to confront him with the Sharanga, Vishnu’s bow.</p>
			<p>Parashurama, a descendant of Bhrigu, sported matted locks coiled at the crown, and wielded an axe, bow and shaft in his hands. He scornfully looked at Rama, and challenged him, “Oh valiant son of Dasharatha, I just heard of your skills in bending and breaking the Pinaka. I have in my possession an equally mighty bow, that of Vishnu. String it now and prove your might. If you succeed, you would be worthy of a single combat with me!”</p>
			<p>Dasharatha who was aghast at these words, appealed to Parashurama’s noble birth and scholarly upbringing. He also politely reminded Parashurama of his vows to end his hostilities with the kshatriyas. “Honourable rishi, you renounced all your earthly possessions, turned them over to sage Kashyapa and retired to Mount Mahendra to perform austerities. It is not becoming of you to indulge in combat now.”</p>
			<p>Parashurama, however, turned a deaf ear to Dasharatha’s entreaties and continued speaking to Rama.</p>
			<p>“Come on, Rama, I dare you to string this bow!” he thundered.</p>
			<p>Rama, who had hitherto remained silent as a mark of respect to his father and other elders around him, responded to the challenge. He seized the bow and arrow from Parashurama’s hands and said, “I will not hurl this arrow at you for the twin reasons that, I respect you, and you share kinship with the great Vishwamitra. However, since the arrow has to be discharged once it is removed from its quiver, I place before you, two options. Do I render you immobile with it, or would you rather give up all the merit accrued to you through your austerities?”</p>
			<p>Thus saying, Rama strung the Sharanga with a swift movement. All the heavenly beings – Brahma along with the gods, gandharvas, kinnaras, yakshas, siddhas, nagas, ogres and demons, applauded Rama’s magnificent feat. Parashurama was rendered speechless. He bowed in reverence before Rama and said, “I surrender to you, the merits of asceticism that I have obtained to far. I am now convinced that you are Lord Vishnu incarnate!”</p>

			<p>Dasharatha and his men proceeded to Ayodhya. The capital of the Kosala king was awash with colour in preparation to welcome the royal couples. The celebratory sounds of drums, conches, trumpets and cymbals, could be heard for miles before the royal procession reached the city gates. The Kosala capital exploded into a kaleidoscope of colour with the continuous roll of firecrackers. Every lane and alleyway of Ayodhya dazzled with lights, adding glitz and sparkle to the silhouette of temples and buildings.</p>
			<p>To such tumultuous greeting, the brides of Dasharatha’s sons were heralded into their new home. United in wedlock, the couples enjoyed a blissful life in Ayodhya. They also discharged their duties towards each other, their family and State, with utmost devotion.</p>
