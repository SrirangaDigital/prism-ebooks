		<p>When they reached Pampa Lake, Rama became nostalgic. When he saw the lotu	s-ridden lake he was overcome by a rush of emotion and memory that was as intimate as it was compelling. He was reminded of Sita’s enchantment when she had seen a similar waterbody at Panchavati.</p>
		<p>Sugreeva was seized with fear when he saw Rama and Lakshmana approaching his hideout with weapons in hand.</p>
		<p>“They are perhaps warriors sent by Vaali to kill me!” Sugreeva thought aloud. He immediately called Hanuman, his lieutenant. “Hanuman, find out who these two armed men are and what brings them here.”</p>
		<p>At Sugreeva’s command, Hanuman approached Rama and Lakshmana, disguised as a mendicant. He prostrated before them and paid them due obeisance. His tone was soft and measured as he spoke to them with utmost reverence in chaste Sanskrit. He wished to know what brought the two sage-like, resplendent personages to Rishyamookha. “You have a regal look. Your rightful place is to rule. Yet you are wandering in the forest. You wear garments made of bark and have matted hair, like the ascetics in the forest land. Yet you are carrying bow and arrows like warriors. Who are you? Where have you come from? What has brought you to this part of the forest? This region stands honoured by your effulgent presence,” he observed and bowed humbly before them.</p>
		<p>Hanuman’s face was aglow with intelligence and sensitivity as he spoke. Rama was highly impressed with the manner in which Hanuman made enquiries and delivered his message.</p>
		<p>“Lakshmana, only someone who has mastered the Vedas and the science of grammar can speak with such clarity without blemish. Did you not notice his impeccable choice of words?”</p>
		<p>Hanuman then revealed his true identity to them. “I am Hanuman, the son of Vayu, and a minister of Sugreeva, the glorious leader of monkeys. I come here as his emissary, seeking your friendship.”</p>
		<p>Rama was happy to learn Hanuman was Sugreeva’s representative. “Lakshmana, I feel encouraged that the very Sugreeva whom we are looking for, is extending friendship to us.”</p>
		<p>Lakshmana narrated their story to Hanuman – their exile, their encounters with rakshasas and how the wily Ravana had stealthily carried away Sita. They were now roaming the forest, moving from place to place in search of Sita.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was convinced that the brothers had nothing to do with Vaali. He carried them on his shoulders and flew to Sugreeva’s hideout in the hills.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Friendship pact</h2>
			<p>A cordial relationship sprung up between the sons of Dasharatha and Sugreeva. Rama promised Sugreeva help in getting back his lost kingdom from Vaali. Sugreeva for his part, agreed to help Rama find Sita. The friendship between the siblings of Ayodhya, and Sugreeva was forged and formally solemnized, with fire as a witness.</p>
			<p>When Sugreeva heard Rama speak of Sita’s abduction by Ravana, he recalled that some of his companions had seen a rakshasa carrying away a woman who was shouting for help. In fact the woman in distress had dropped a bundle which the vanaras had collected. Rama was eager to see the package. Sugreeva had a vanara fetch it and handed it to Rama. Rama broke down and sobbed as he recognized Sita’s sash which she had used to wrap up some items of jewelry worn by her. He felt so tortured by pain that it was left to Lakshmana to open the bunched up piece of cloth. Lakshmana recognized one piece of ornament as the anklet worn by Sita. Rama once again experienced the agonizing pangs of separation from his beloved. He kept turning over the jewels again and again, clasping them close to his chest. He rambled on, expressing his intense longing to see Sita. Rama was ridden with grief and his voice trailed off into vacant nothingness. Those around him could sense the pessimism that was seeping into him.</p>
			<p>Sugreeva consoled Rama, saying “I too am separated from my wife for no fault of mine. Yet I do not lose hope. I am awaiting the opportune moment to get back whatever I have lost. Pious Rama, you are a shining example of courage, valour, virtue and righteousness. How can you give way to grief and abandon fortitude? If we allow ourselves to be mentally weakened by adversities, how are we to overcome them? I humbly request you, not to become overwhelmed by sorrow. In honour of the friendship I have avowed, I will help you find Mother Sita.”</p>
			<p>The vanara chief assured Rama that his huge army would find Sita. Rama felt comforted.</p>
			<p>Lakshmana who was excited on seeing the ornaments, questioned the monkeys. He learned from them that the aerial car used by the rakshasa had headed south. “Now we know where to look for Sita,” he said.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Brothers turned foes</h2>
			<p>“Vaali and I doted on each other and lived happily in Kishkinda, our kingdom, of which he was king. But one day fate intervened and we parted ways. We brothers became sworn enemies and continue to be so,” Sugreeva began to narrate to Rama, his own story.</p>
			<p>One day, a rakshasa named Maayaavi challenged Vaali to an instant fight. Vaali who never refused a combat, rushed out at Maayaavi. Sugreeva followed his brother. Seeing the siblings chase him, the demon ran faster and disappeared into a big cave.</p>
			<p>Vaali, before going after Mayavi into the cave, took a vow from Sugreeva. “Promise me, brother, that you will stand guard at the cave entrance until I return after killing the demon.”</p>
			<p>“I promise, brother,” replied Sugreeva. He waited long but neither Vaali, nor Mayaavi came out of the cave. However, Sugreeva soon heard ear-piercing cries emerge from the cave. As he stood pondering over what might have happened inside, he saw blood gushing out of the cave.</p>
			<p>Sugreeva froze. His mind stopped working. He jumped to the conclusion that his dear brother had been killed by Mayavi. He did not want his brother’s killer to escape after committing the heinous crime. He therefore blocked the cave entrance with a huge boulder and returned to Kishkinda. Thereupon he announced Vaali’s death at the hands of the rakshasa.</p>
			<p>Kishkinda was in chaos without a ruler. “Without a ruler, there will be no safety or security for anyone in our kingdom. For the good of our people, you must take on the responsibility of kingship and occupy the throne,” Vaali’s ministers pleaded with Sugreeva. Sugreeva assumed the throne of Kishkinda after all the ministers convinced him with their arguments.</p>
			<p>But destiny had other plans. It was Maayaavi who had been slain by Vaali. The vanara hero Vaali was dismayed to find the cave blocked with a huge rock when he made to come out of it. Vaali, with much effort and difficulty dislodged the boulder and came out. He was blind with anger at Sugreeva who he believed had deliberately shut him up in the cave. When he reached his capital, his anger amplified when he saw Sugreeva sitting on his throne. “How wicked and cruel could you be? You deliberately shut me inside the cave for Mayaavi to kill me so that you could become king of Kishkinda!”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva could not prove his innocence in the face of Vaali’s uncontrolled wrath. Vaali banished Sugreeva from his kingdom.</p>
			<p>However, some of the vanaras who were faithful to Sugreeva, accompanied him to Rishyamooka Hill. The hill was a safe haven for Sugreeva because Vaali would not access it. Vaali had been cursed by rishi Mathanga that he would die if he entered Rishyamooka.</p>
			<p>“So here I am, Rama, living like a fugitive, having lost my kingdom, wife, and all else.”</p>
			<p>“Rest assured, I will kill Vaali and restore your kingdom to you,” Rama promised Sugreeva.</p>
			<p>Sugreeva was happy to have found an ally in Rama. Yet, he had a nagging doubt regarding Rama’s ability to vanquish Vaali who was a powerful warrior. He wished to ascertain Rama’s abilities. Sugreeva therefore related an incident to Rama, to impress upon him, Vaali’s might. Dundubhi, the demon buffalo, endowed with the strength of a thousand elephants, once challenged Vaali to a duel. In the clash that followed, Vaali easily defeated him. With a single swift movement of his hand, he hurled the blood soaked body of the demon to a great distance. Unfortunately, the blood spilled by the side of sage Mathanga’s hermitage. Enraged at this, Mathanga uttered a curse: “Whoever has committed this gruesome deed and thereby polluted my ashram and its precincts, will meet his end upon stepping into Rishyamooka!”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva concluded his narration to Rama saying, “This is the reason I am safe at Rishyamookha. Vaali will not dare to take one step in this direction for fear of dying. You will now have an idea of how strong he is.”</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama proves his mettle </h2>
			<p>Rama wished to allay Sugreeva’s fears and dispel his doubts. He informed Sugreeva that he was willing to accept any challenge set by him to prove that he was a good match for his brother Vaali. Sugreeva replied, “I wish to see you split just one of the seven giant sal trees here, with a single shot of your arrow. I would also feel comforted if you would lift with a single foot, the bones of Dundubhi that lie here in a heap, and fling it a great distance.”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva added, “It is not my intent to test you or belittle you. While I am fully aware of my brother’s skills and strength, I have not seen your power. Hence I fear the havoc Vaali can create!”</p>
			<p>To put Sugreeva’s mind at rest, Rama lifted Dundubhi’s bones with a single toe and flung them a distance, several times farther than what Sugreeva had asked for. But Sugreeva remained skeptical. When Vaali threw Dundubhi’s carcass, it was weighty with blood and flesh. But now, the bones, free of moisture and flesh, were lighter and hence easier to throw.</p>
			<p>Rama gave the ultimate proof of his potent power by splitting with his arrow, not one, but all the seven sal trees in a row, with a single shot.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-4.4">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Rama kills Vaali </h2>
			<p>Sugreeva felt at ease after he watched Rama display such supreme strength. He was now ready to challenge Vaali to a duel. The plan was for Rama to hide behind a tree and strike Vaali when the brothers fought each other. A fierce battle ensued between the siblings who strikingly resembled one another. Rama was unable to distinguish Vaali from Sugreeva. He did not wish to risk killing Sugreeva in the bargain. Sugreeva was unable to defend Vaali’s onslaught. He speedily beat a retreat to his refuge, Rishyamookha.</p>
			<p>Rama once again asked Sugreeva to fight Vaali. This time, Lakshmana gave Sugreeva a garland to wear around his neck to differentiate him from his brother. Vaali’s wife Tara was apprehensive about her husband’s confrontation with Sugreeva and pleaded with him to refrain from accepting the challenge. “By the manner in which he dares you, I fear this will be no mean combat. I am sure he has allies who can harm you.” Tara informed Vaali of the alliance that Sugreeva had forged with the sons of Dasharatha. She advised her husband to end the hostility with his brother for the wellbeing of everyone. Vaali refused to heed Tara, saying he would fight Sugreeva under all circumstances.</p>
			<p>As the brothers fought each other, Rama struck Vaali at the opportune moment and mortally wounded him. While life still lingered feebly in the fallen Vaali, he reproached Rama for not facing him directly in battle. “You have belied your virtuous and noble birth by indulging in a sinful act. You have killed me, a monkey who did not harm you or your territory in any way,” Vaali said to Rama as he lay dying.</p>
			<p>Rama justified his action by telling Vaali that he had only received the punishment that was due him.</p>
			<p>Both Vaali and Sugreeva repented their rash deeds as Vaali counted the minutes before life ebbed out of him.</p>
			<p>Before he breathed his last, Vaali entrusted Sugreeva with a responsibility: “Kishkinda is now yours to rule. You must be a father to my son Angada and take good care of him, and take Tara as your wife.”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva, Angada and Tara felt profound sorrow at Vaali’s demise. Rama asked Sugreeva to conduct Vaali’s last rites in a befitting manner. Sugreeva performed his brother’s obsequies with the help of Angada and Tara.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sugreeva crowned king</h2>
			<p>Once Vaali was laid to rest, Rama wished Sugreeva well and also reminded him to begin the search for Sita at the end of the rainy season. The Ikshvaku brothers then took leave of Hanuman, Sugreeva and the rest of the vanaras, to dwell in the caves of Mount Prasravana on the outskirts of Kishkinda.</p>
			<p>Sugreeva marched to Kishkinda, joyful to return to his city. Amidst pomp and pageantry, he was crowned king and Angada, the prince regent.</p>
			<p>The monsoons had abated and given way to autumn but Sugreeva was so overjoyed to regain his kingdom that he indulged in the pursuit of pleasures, unmindful of his promise to Rama.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-4.6">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Lakshmana’s anger</h2>
			<p>Prasravana Mountains which Rama and Lakshmana had made their home, abounded with aromatic shrubs and trees and inhabited by several species of wild creatures. But Rama barely enjoyed his environs for he fretted over Sita’s wellbeing, and longed to have her with him. He constantly thought of her and the predicament she would be facing at the hands of Ravana. He grew restless as the rains had stopped and yet there was no sign of Sugreeva gearing up for action to look for Sita. He felt deep anguish and expressed to Lakshmana, his misgivings at Sugreeva’s indifference in keeping his word.</p>
			<p>“Lakshmana, now that the monsoons have abated, it is time for kings to carry out conquests and undertake expansion of their kingdoms. But I see no signs of Sugreeva making any effort to look for Sita. It appears as if he has forgotten my goodwill gesture. He shows no gratitude for the service I rendered him.”</p>
			<p>Laskhmana was angry that Sugreeva had caused Rama such distress. He was beside himself with rage. He entered Kishkinda, bow in hand, to demand an explanation from Sugreeva for his apparent apathy. He was even willing to fight and destroy Sugreeva if the need arose. The vanaras who saw Lakshmana seething with anger, fled from his approach. The leader of the monkeys rushed to Sugreeva to communicate to him, Lakshmana’s arrival.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Hanuman who perceived Sugreeva’s pursuit of luxury to intoxicating levels, gently reminded him of the task before him. The mighty son of Vayu told Sugreeva, “The spirit of friendship must be honoured and adhered to. As Rama’s friend, and as an upright and respectable king, it is only appropriate that you uphold your honour and dignity by delivering your pledge to Rama. You must begin your search for Sita.”</p>
			<p>Sugreeva acknowledged the just and wise words of Hanuman. He gave orders for the vanara forces stationed at various points in Kishkinda, to assemble before him. He said, “no matter what I do in return, it will be insignificant in comparison to what he has done for me. I regret that I have inadvertently caused Rama and you pain by indulging in my own enjoyment, unmindful of my promise to Rama. Please inform Rama that I earnestly beg his pardon. I shall immediately press my vanara force into action to look for Mother Sita.”</p>
			<p>Lakshmana was now satisfied that Sugreeva would take his promise to Rama seriously and begin the search for Sita. He returned to convey to Rama, the vanara king’s message to him. “Brother, Sugreeva has assured me that he would send his vanara sena in all four directions to look for Sita,” Lakshmana reported to Rama.</p>

		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-4.7">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sugreeva’s army sets out to find Sita</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile the vast monkey army assembled. It contained stalwarts like Angada, Hanuman, Jambavan and several others. Sugreeva made four divisions of his army. He sent one division each to the East, West, North and South, to look for Sita. He gave orders to the leaders of each battalion before they left on their mission, “Sita must be discovered. You must bring news of her within a month.”</p>
			<p>The brigade led by Angada which went south consisted of Hanuman and Jambavan the bear, among others. Sugreeva vested Hanuman with special responsibility, saying, “Son of Vayu, you possess the strength and intelligence of your father. You alone can successfully accomplish this task. Make haste and find Sita.”</p>
			<p>Rama gave Hanuman his signet ring, saying, “When you find Sita, give her this ring. She will be comforted that you are my messenger.”</p>
			<p>Hanuman saluted his king Sugreeva, and Rama, before taking leave of them. He headed South with his army.</p>
			<p>Each contingent of Sugreeva’s army was sincere in wanting to unite Rama with Sita. They began their search for Sita enthusiastically, heading in the direction they had been allotted.</p>
			<p>The vanaras spread like ants in all directions looking for Sita. They crossed rivers, leaped upon mountains and combed every inch of the forests for her. Sugreeva’s forces that had gone in the East, West and North directions, returned at the end of the month, unsuccessful in their attempt.</p>
			<p>Hanuman and his team searched the forests and caves of the mountains, but did not get a single clue to Sita’s whereabouts. They pressed forward and arrived at a vast desert. The monkeys felt their energy sapped by the scorching heat of the sandy terrain. The simians were thirsty, hungry, weak and tired, and became desperate when they did not see any vegetation or water. They feared that they would perish and were overwhelmed with sadness and despair in not succeeding in their mission of finding Sita.</p>
			<p>Their sagging spirits rose when they suddenly experienced a gust of chill breeze. As they turned to take in lungsful of the whiff that caressed their face, they noticed a group of birds flying out of a hole, not far away. The monkeys became curious and rushed to the place from where the birds flew out. They felt they had found a passage which would take them to a cool region blessed with water. They were so desperate to escape the heat of the forest and get some water to drink, that they ventured to explore by going down the hole in single file. As they proceeded, it became darker and darker, so much so that they could barely see the vanara just ahead of them. Desperation turned to fear. The monkeys panicked, thinking that they were trapped in an unknown dungeon. Just then, a ray of light streaked through the dungeon and gave them cause for cheer. The passageway became wider and soon they saw a sprawling carpet of lush grass spread before them. They were astonished to see a beautifully laid out city with mansions, streets, gardens and fountains. As they rushed towards the water front, an elderly monkey stopped them when he saw a woman ascetic seated on a deer skin. When the monkeys approached her, the kind looking hermit slowly opened her eyes.</p>
			<p>Hanuman told her that they served Sugreeva, the Lord of Kishkinda and were on a mission to find Sita, Rama’s wife. The gentle lady, whose name was Svayamprabha, could see that the vanaras were famished. She asked them to help themselves to fruits from the orchard, without causing damage to the trees, and quench their thirst with water from the stream.</p>
			<p>When the monkeys’ hunger was sated and they were sufficiently invigorated, they resumed their search. But they were dismayed when they could not find an exit. Hanuman again approached Svayamprabha for help.</p>
			<p>She told Hanuman that they were in a city that was built underground by Maya the asura architect. He had constructed it for his daughter Hema who was away, visiting Devaloka. “Hema has left the place in my charge. Maya has designed the place in such a way that no one who dares to enter it can escape from here,” Swayamprabha revealed.</p>
			<p>However, she assured Hanuman that she would help them to get out of the place with her yogic power. The monkeys closed their eyes tight upon Svayamprabha’s request. They were thrilled and amazed to find themselves on the shore of the southern sea when they opened their eyes.<strong> </strong></p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sampati</h2>
			<p>“We have come to the very end of the land and nowhere did we see Mother Sita,” brooded Angada.</p>
			<p>“We are nearing the deadline set for us to find Sita.”</p>
			<p>“How can we get back to Kishkinda after failing to find Sita.”</p>
			<p>“How can we face Sugreeva and Rama?” Each of the vanaras lamented in his own way, reflecting upon their failure to locate Sita.</p>
			<p>An old vulture perched on a tree atop a cliff was listening to the vanaras, unnoticed by them.</p>
			<p>“It looks like Jatayu lost his life in vain when he fought to save Sita from Ravana,” joined in another vanara.</p>
			<p>At the mention of Jatayu’s name, the old vulture became alert. He was none other than Sampati, Jatayu’s brother.</p>
			<p>He immediately approached the monkeys. “How do you know my dear brother Jatayu? You say he is no more! What happened to him? How did he die?” asked the old bird.</p>
			<p>Sampati and Jatayu were the sons of Aruna, the god of Dawn. When they were children, they would compete with one another to see who could fly higher in the sky. On one such occasion, when Jatayu got quite close to the sun, the heat threatened to burn him. Sampati immediately spread his wings and protected Jatayu. Sampati’s wings got burnt in the process and he fell on a hill, no longer able to fly, and ever since, began to live there.</p>
			<p>The vanaras recounted to Sampati, how Rama, Lakshmana and Sita came to live in the forest. They told him of Jatayu’s heroic efforts to save Sita from Ravana and of how he had lost his life in this attempt.</p>
			<p>Sampati was saddened to hear of his brother’s demise. He did not want Jatayu’s efforts to go waste. He was determined to help the vanaras in whatever way he could. Though Sampati was old and weak, he had very sharp eyesight. He could see things that were very far away. He directed his gaze across the southern sea. Beyond the sea was the island of Lanka. There he spotted a woman sitting under an Ashoka tree, surrounded by rakshasa women. He informed the vanara team that Sita was held captive in Lanka, across the southern ocean, a hundred yojanas away.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 unnumbered" id="id-4.9">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Who could cross the ocean?</h2>
			<p>Now that they knew where to look for Sita, the monkeys wondered who among them was capable of making a leap across the southern ocean.</p>
			<p>A vanara said he could cover ten yojanas with one leap. Another claimed he could cover fifty yojanas. Their commander Angada known for his strength said that he could possibly cover even a full hundred yojanas with one leap but was not sure whether he would have the strength to leap back to rejoin them.</p>
			<p>Now there was silence. It became clear that no vanara could vault over to Lanka and come back with news of Sita.</p>
			<p>“There is only one hero who can bound across to Lanka and also come back with information on Sita. It’s him,” said Jambavan, pointing to Hanuman who was sitting quietly, away from the other monkeys.</p>
			<p>When Hanuman was a child, he tried to catch the sun thinking it was a juicy orange. Indra, the king of Gods fearing that Hanuman would snatch the sun tried to stop him by throwing his thunderbolt at the young Hanuman. Hanuman’s jaw broke when it was struck by Indra’s powerful weapon, and he fell on the mountain, unconscious. Vayu became furious when he saw his son injured. He stopped his movements and became still. There was no air for anyone to breathe. All creatures became breathless and felt suffocated.</p>
			<p>In unison, the gods begged Vayu to cast away his anger. But Vayu did not heed them. To pacify and appease him, Brahma and Indra granted several boons to Hanuman. “No weapon will be able to kill your son. He will be immortal,” they assured Vayu. Thus mollified, Vayu resumed his function.</p>
			<p>As a child, Hanuman was mischievous. Brahma’s boons had made him so strong that none could control him. The sages who tired of his pranks, cast a spell on him saying that he would not remember his own power unless he was reminded of it by someone. “This is the reason why Hanuman is sitting there so quietly, oblivious of his own strength. But he alone is capable of crossing the ocean with a single leap over the vast water body,” Jambavan explained to the vanaras.</p>
			<p>He then approached Hanuman, accompanied by the rest of the vanara force.</p>
			<p>“Hanuman, you alone can fulfill Sugreeva’s promise to Rama. You can increase your size to whatever proportions you want. You can cross this sea in one single jump to reach Lanka,” said Jambavan.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Hanuman, you can cross the ocean in one leap,” said Angada.</p>
			<p>The vanaras raised a chorus, “Yes, Hanuman, You can. Hanuman you can, you can…”</p>
