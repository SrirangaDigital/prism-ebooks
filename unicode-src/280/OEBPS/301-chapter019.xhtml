		<p class="P-TextFlush">A friend of mine was a guest at the White House for a weekend during the administration of Calvin Coolidge. Drifting into the President’s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, ‘That’s a pretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young woman’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, ‘Now, don’t get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with your punctuation’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for Presidentship. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign speech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn’t do. It would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He must not kill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say ‘no’. Note how adroitly he did it. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,’ McKinley said. ‘No one could have prepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him re-write his second speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the campaign. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for $ 12000, and that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For 18 months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and even the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House. ‘We are now on the brink of destruction,’ Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope. Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">I am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general when the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general’s action. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote: ‘There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you’. Talk about tact! And diplomacy! </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker: </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote">I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">I believe you to be a brave and skilful soldier, which, of course, you are and I do like that. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm. But I think that during General Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">Only those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I will risk the dictatorship. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all the commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it down. </p>
		<p class="P-TextFlushQuote-2 para-style-override-1">Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance, go forward and give us victories. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">You are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will operate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see. Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark Company, Philadelphia. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">The Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by a certain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the sub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this building declared that he couldn’t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All because of one man! </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Long-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to New York to bear the bronze lion in his den. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name,?’ Mr Gaw asked the president of the subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. ‘No, I didn’t know that’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘Well,’ said Mr. Gaw, ‘when I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to get your address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘I never knew that,’ the subcontractor said. He checked the phone book with interest. ‘Well, it’s an unusual name,’ he said proudly. ‘My family came from Holland and settled in New York almost two hundred years ago. He continued to talk about his family and his ancestors for several minutes. When he was finished Mr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he had and compared it favorably with a number of similar plants he had visited. ‘It is one of the cleanest and neatest bronze factories I ever saw,’ said Gaw. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘I’ve spent a lifetime building up this business,’ the subcontractor said, ‘and I am rather proud of it. Would you like to take a look around the factory?’ </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">During this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other man on his system of fabrication and told him how and why it seemed superior to those of some of his competitors. Gaw commented on some unusual machines, and the subcontractor announced that he himself had invented those machines. He spent considerable time showing Gaw how they operated and the superior work they turned out. He insisted on taking his visitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been said about the real purpose of Gaw’s visit. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">After lunch, the subcontractor said, ‘Now, to get down to business. Naturally, I know why you’re here. I didn’t expect that our meeting would be so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia with my promise that your material will be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders have to be delayed’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it. The material arrived on time, and the building was completed on the day the completion contract specified. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">If this hadn’t happened, Mr. Gaw would have used the hammer and dynamite method generally employed on such occasions.</p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Dorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported to one of our classes how she was able to help one of her employees become more productive. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">We recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee. Her contact with our customers was very good. She was accurate and efficient in handling individual transactions. The problem developed at the end of the day when it was time to balance out. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘The head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this woman. ‘She is holding up everyone else because she is so slow in balancing out. I’ve shown her over and over, but she can’t get it. She’s got to go’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘The next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when handling the normal everyday transactions, and she was very pleasant with our customers’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">‘It didn’t take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out. After the office closed, I went over to talk with her. She was obviously nervous and upset. I praised her for being so friendly and outgoing with the customers and complimented her for the accuracy and speed used in that work. I then suggested we review the procedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once she realized I had confidence in her, she easily followed my suggestions and soon mastered this function. We have had no problems with her since then’. </p>
		<p class="TextIndent">Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is painkilling. A leader will use ... </p><br />
		<p class="Priciple">Principle 19</p>
		<p class="PricipleText">Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</p>
