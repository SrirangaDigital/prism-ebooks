		<p>The joy of being commissioned to write stories related to the Divine is indescribable. I am happy that Shri Pranesh, MD, Prism Books Pvt. Ltd., has yet again reposed faith in me to undertake this daunting task. It is a matter of pride to have an artist of renown, Shri Mohandas Marath, do the illustrations for <em>Hanuman</em>. I do not have enough words to thank these gentlemen.</p>
		<p>To my family – my parents, husband and children – I owe a big thank you for their constant encouragement and inspiration. To my sister, Mrs. Sowmya Rangarajan, who has become my unofficial editor for all times, I need to coin novel expressions of gratitude!</p>
		<p>As always, I’m grateful to Mr. Sreesha Belakvadi and Mrs. Nalini Murali for introducing me to Shri Pranesh, MD of Prism Books.</p>
