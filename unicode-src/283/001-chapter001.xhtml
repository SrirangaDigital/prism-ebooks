			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman, an incarnation of Shiva</h2>
			<p>However, all versions concur that Hanuman is an incarnation or aspect of Lord Shiva. According to one story, there once lived a demon by name Gardhaba Nisvana who was so named because he brayed like a donkey. He was an ardent devotee of Shiva and performed severe penance to please him. A duly gratified Shiva decided to grant him a boon.</p>
			<p>‘Ask, and you shall be granted your wish,’ Shiva said to Nisvana.</p>
			<p>‘I should be invincible against demons, yakshas and gods!’ replied Nisvana.</p>
			<p>‘So it be,’ Shiva granted his wish.</p>
			<p>Nisvana who was emboldened by the boon he had received, began terrorizing the sages by disrupting their sacred activities. He would, by his harsh and loud braying alone, kill them. The rishis and gods, unable to bear the torture approached Brahma for help. Brahma however, asked them to seek Shiva’s help because the demon was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva.</p>
			<p>Shiva expressed his helplessness. ‘I cannot harm my devotee,’ he said.</p>
			<p>The sages and gods now turned to Lord Vishnu for respite.</p>
			<p>‘Rest assured that I will kill the demon and save you from destruction,’ Vishnu promised.</p>
			<p>‘But that would be impossible because Nisvana is protected by my grace,’ Shiva said to Vishnu.</p>
			<p>‘Nisvana has invited trouble upon himself by indulging in misdeeds. His strength is therefore reduced and I will be able to kill him easily,’ replied Vishnu.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/001.jpg" alt="shiva" />
			</figure>
			<p>Shiva then challenged Vishnu,  saying,  ‘If you succeed in killing Nisvana, I will humbly offer my services to you’.</p>
			<p>Vishnu accepted Shiva’s challenge and replied, ‘I too shall happily serve you if I fail to kill him’.</p>
			<p>Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini, a beautiful celestial woman. He carried with him a vessel full of an intoxicating drink and appeared before Nisvana who was relaxing. The demon was instantly attracted to the charming Mohini and sought to be with her. Mohini cleverly lured him to partake of the drink she was carrying. Nisvana who emptied the vessel in one huge gulp, soon fell down, unconscious. Seeing the opportune moment, Lord Vishnu transformed himself from Mohini, to a wolf. He tore apart Nisvana’s stomach and killed him instantaneously.</p>
			<p>Lord Shiva lost the bet. He was ready to serve Lord Vishnu.</p>
			<p>However, since Vishnu and Shiva were friends devoted to each other, neither cared nor wished to defeat the other for personal satisfaction or gratification. Vishnu said, ‘Our challenges should be for the good of people, for the welfare of the Universe. You may serve me, incarnated as Kapi Veera, or Monkey Hero when I go down to earth in the Treta Yuga, personified as Rama’.</p>
			<p>Shiva thus incarnated as Hanuman and served Vishnu when he took birth as Rama. But who were Anjana and Kesari? How did Hanuman come to be their son?</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Lord Shiva grants sage Kashyapa a boon</h2>
			<p>We have always known of Hanuman as <em>Anjaneya</em>, the son of Anjana, and as <em>Kesari Nandan</em>, the son of Kesari. But who are Anjana and Kesari? How did Hanuman come to be their son?</p>
			<p>In ancient times there lived a pious couple, Kashyapa and Sadhya. Kashyapa was a great scholar who went with his wife to Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva, to do penance. He braved the extreme hot and cold weathers and continued to meditate upon the Lord. In due time, Shiva who was much moved by Kashyapa’s austerities, appeared before him to grant him his wish.</p>
			<p>Kashyapa was overwhelmed with joy upon seeing Shiva and Parvati before him. With palms folded and head bent low in reverence, he said, ‘Lord, I want that you should be born as our son!’</p>
			<p>‘I shall be born as Hanuman your son when you are re-born as Kesari and your wife Sadhya takes birth as Anjana,’ Shiva replied.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/002.jpg" alt="shivaparvathi" />
			</figure>
			<p>Agni and Vayu, the gods of fire and wind who witnessed this event, were impressed</p>
			<p>with Kashyapa’s dedication. They too desired that the Lord be born as their son. Shiva smiled kindly upon them and said, ‘So it be!’</p>
			<p>Kashyapa reincarnated as Kesari, a vanara or monkey. His wife Sadhya took birth as Anjana, the daughter of sage Goutama and his wife Ahalya. But there were several interesting incidents that took place before Kashyapa and Sadhya took birth as Kesari and Anjana.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The birth of Hanuman begins with Punjikasthala </h2>
			<p>The birth of Hanuman begins with Punjikastala, an apsara who served in the celestial palace of Brahma. A young Punjikastala was once feeling very bored. She was aimlessly roaming the heavens when she observed a monkey, sitting cross-legged in the lotus pose, engaged in deep meditation. The sight so amused her that she impulsively started laughing and poking fun at him. The monkey rishi who was none other than Brihaspathi in disguise, was so immersed in meditation that he remained oblivious to what was happening around him. This emboldened Punjikastala to ridicule him further. She began throwing stones and fruits at him. The rishi’s concentration was broken when one of these objects hit his head. Angered at this interruption, he opened his eyes to see the source of the disturbance.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/003.jpg" alt="hanuman" />
			</figure>
			<p>His eyes turned red and his nostrils flared in intense anger. ‘You have disturbed my penance,’ he thundered. ‘I curse that your face will turn into that of a monkey the moment you fall in love!’</p>
			<p>Punjikastala regretted her deed. Tears flowed copiously from her eyes. She fell at the sage’s feet and begged for forgiveness.</p>
			<p>‘I offer you my sincere apologies. But please do not curse me thus, O great sage,’ she pleaded.</p>
			<p>Brihaspathi could see that Punjikastala truly repented her action.</p>
			<p>‘I cannot take back the curse once I’ve uttered it. But you will be redeemed of it when you give birth to an incarnation of Lord Shiva! Pray to him’. Brihaspathi disappeared from her sight after saying this.</p>
			<p>An extremely anguished and teary eyed Punjikasthala beseeched Brahma to intervene and nullify the curse. Brahma who was happy with her services at Brahmaloka said, ‘I cannot nullify the rishi’s curse. Instead, I will send you down to earth where you will meet your husband-to-be and everything else will fall in place as Brihaspathi has indicated. But you must be ever steadfast in worshipping Shiva who will ultimately redeem you from the curse’.</p>
			<p>Thus, Punjikasthala came down to earth and was born as Anjana, the beautiful daughter of Goutama Rishi and his wife Ahalya.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kunjara and Vindhyavalli become Anjana’s foster parents </h2>
			<p>The great sage Goutama was leading a blissful life with his wife Ahalya. They were blessed with two lovely children, a son Satananda, and Anjana, a chirpy daughter. However, Indra the god of thunder and rain who was enamoured of Ahalya’s charm and beauty, desired to covet her. He appeared before Ahalya in the guise of Goutama and duped her into believing that he was her husband. The farsighted sage who returned from his ritualistic ablutions was enraged when he saw them together.</p>
			<p>Goutama who was infuriated, cursed them. ‘Ahalya, you will atone for your sin by doing penance while remaining invisible to the world. You will be freed from this curse when Rama steps into our abode. His holy feet will sanctify this place and you shall regain your form in all its glory’.</p>
			<p>Goutama after uttering the curse on his wife, wondered how he would single-handedly rear his young children, Satananda and Anjana. It was at this time that Sage Narada met him and advised him.</p>
			<p>‘Why don’t you send your son Satananda to King Janaka of Mithila so that he can be brought up to be his state priest? He will be taken care of very well there. And as for your daughter Anjana, give her in adoption to Kunjara the monkey warrior. He and his wife do not have any issues and they yearn for a child. They will be only too happy to shower her with a lot of love and give her a good upbringing’.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/004.jpg" alt="Goutama Ahalya" />
			</figure>
			<p>Goutama heeded Narada’s counsel. He sent Satananda to Mithila and Anjana lived happily as the foster daughter of Kunjara and Vindhyavalli.</p>
			<p>Kunjara was a brave monkey warrior who lived in another region and was well known for his courage and goodness. Though he and his wife Vindhyavalli lived well, they were unhappy because they had no children. They propitiated Shiva by performing severe penance to beget progeny.</p>
			<p>Shiva who was pleased with them, appeared before them and prophesized, ‘Though you will not have any children of your own, you will definitely have the pleasure of bringing up a daughter when you adopt one. And through her your lineage will continue, for she will be blessed with a divine child’. Shiva vanished after making this prediction to Kunjara and his wife.</p>
			<p>Kunjara’s joy knew no bounds when Goutama entrusted Anjana’s care to him and his wife. Anjana was happy in her new surroundings and basked in the love that her foster parents lavished upon her. Yet, all through these years she remained focused upon Shiva, devoutly praying to him. She even made a Linga out of mud and worshipped its form every day.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-001.05">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Anjana weds Kesari</h2>
			<p>One day as Anjana was taking a walk, she was deeply meditating upon Shiva. She lost all sense of time and strayed into a dense forest. The sun slid off the sky and dusk descended on the forest. A group of ascetics who were living in the region were amazed to find such a beautiful girl wander all alone in this dangerous territory. They commended her on her courage and wished to know who she was and what brought her to that jungle. Anjana gracefully accepted the hospitality of the ascetics as they offered her fruits and food to eat.</p>
			<p>When Anjana had partaken of the meal given her, the ascetics narrated to her their tale of woe, of how they lived in constant threat of being attacked by a demon. ‘We live here, forever in dread of being killed by Sambasadan, the hideous monster who perpetrates atrocities on us. We fear he may attack our ashram tonight! We are preparing to defend ourselves with the kindly help of Kesari, the warrior king of the monkeys,’ the ascetics revealed.</p>
			<p>‘‘I will also help you fight the demon,’ Anjana responded impulsively. The ascetics then departed to make preparations for the anticipated confrontation with Sambasadan. Anjana immediately turned to Shiva and Parvati in prayer, ‘Oh Lord, please give me ample strength to fight this fiend and protect these kindly people who have offered me food and protection for the night’.</p>
			<p>Anjana had barely finished praying when she heard divinely prophetic words from the heavens, ‘Sambasadan can be annihilated only by his own blood. May you be victorious!’</p>
			<p>Anjana had goose pimples on her body when she heard the oracle. She instinctively knew it was Lord Shiva who had answered her prayers, and that he would help her tackle the demon when he attacked the rishis in the forest.</p>
			<p>As Anjana stood feeling euphoric, she sensed the presence of a man standing close by, his back towards her. In the faint light of the approaching night, Anjana made out that he was examining weapons that he wielded. Though she could not see his face, she surmised from his muscular and well-built physique, that he must be a  warrior. Just as she was wondering whether she should strike a conversation with him, he turned to face her.</p>
			<p>Anjana gasped at what she saw. Though he had the face of a monkey, he looked handsome and had a royal demeanour. She was at once charmed by the glint in his eyes and the cherubic smile that suffused his face. Anjana was overcome by a rush of emotions which she could best describe as love at first sight. To her, his eyes seemed to speak volumes in reciprocation of her feelings. The young Anjana fainted as he approached her.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/005.jpg" alt="Anjana Kesari" />
			</figure>
			<p>When Anjana regained her composure, she was horrified to see that her face had morphed into that of a monkey! She remembered Brihaspathi’s curse and was both distraught and happy at this turn of events. After all she had met the man, her future husband. ‘Perhaps, I would be rid of Brihaspathi’s curse,’ she thought to herself.</p>
			<p>Evidently, the stranger was well groomed and had impeccable manners. He gently asked Anjana if she felt alright. He then introduced himself as Kapiraj Kesari, the king of monkeys who lived on Mount Sumeru. It was apparent from his talk that he had endeared himself to the ascetics in the forests whom he protected from time to time. He had battled and killed Sankha and Sabala, two rogue elephants that had troubled and terrorized them.</p>
			<p>‘I am getting ready to fight the monster Sambasadan now,’ he informed Anjana.</p>
			<p>‘I too shall join the fight with you,’ Anjana responded. As she was about to narrate to him the prophecy she had heard a while ago, the silence of their surrounds was shattered by a loud roar. In an instant, they saw Sambasadan rush towards the hermitage.</p>
			<p>Without wasting time, Kesari charged towards the ogre, weapons in hand. By then, a small crowd collected outside the hermitage and a violent scuffle followed. Though Kesari was at his brilliant best, he was unable to hurt Sambasadan. As Kesari’s spear pierced the demon’s body, just a little blood oozed from his body.</p>
			<p>Anjana who had hitherto been volleying arrows at him, remembered the prophetic words when she saw the monster’s blood fall to the ground. She soon rushed forward and dipped her arrows in Sambasadan’s blood and then fired the same at him. He gave a piercing cry as the arrows hit him. Kesari took cue from Anjana’s action. He too dipped his staff in the demon’s blood and began fighting him afresh. The trick worked and soon Sambasadan met his end at the hands of the two brave warriors.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The ascetics were relieved and happy. They celebrated the victory with dance and music at the hermitage. They felt they had to do something more for Anjana and Kesari than simply offer words of gratitude to them.</p>
			<p>The sages who observed the shy glances exchanged between Anjana and Kesari, felt the pair would make an ideal couple. They sought Kesari’s view on the matter. Once they had his consent, the sages approached Anjana’s foster parents Kunjara and Vindhyavalli. An auspicious day was chosen and Kesari and Anjana were married in the midst of much joy and fanfare.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Dasaratha performs the Putrakameshti yajna</h2>
			<p>With the passage of time, Anjana and Kesari grew more devoted to each other and lived happily. However, they were distressed by the lack of an issue to carry forward their lineage. Anjana, in consultation with her husband, decided to perform penance to beget a child. At that time sage Matanga who visited them, advised her to go to Anjanadri, one of the seven hills of present day Tirupathi-Tirumala Hills, to carry out her austerities. (In fact, the hills later came to be named Anjanadri because Anjana did penance here to beget Hanuman.) Anjana proceeded as suggested by the sage. She meditated upon Shiva after taking a dip in the holy waters of Akasa Ganga every day.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, in faraway Ayodhya, the capital of the Kosala Kingdom, King Dasaratha was performing the Putrakameshti yajna, a sacrifice seeking sons to carry on his ancestry. At the conclusion of the yajna which was performed with the help of sage Rishyashringa, a dazzling Agni Deva, the god of fire appeared before the king. He handed Dasharatha a golden bowl of divine payasam, a kind of pudding, and said, ‘Dasharatha, this potion has been specially prepared by the gods. Give it to your three wives - Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra’.</p>
			<p>King Dasaratha, as instructed, gave the <em>payasam</em> to Kausalya and Kaikeyi. As he was handing out the last portion to Sumitra, a kite snatched it and flew away. Kausalya and Kaikeyi immediately gave a portion each of their pudding to Sumitra. In due course of time Kausalya gave birth to Rama the protagonist of the Ramayana, and Kaikeyi delivered Bharata, while Sumitra gave birth to twins Lakshmana and Shatrugana.</p>
			<p>The kite that whisked the <em>payasam</em> off the hands of Sumitra was actually an apsara or celestial singer and dancer, who had been cursed by Brahma to become a bird. When the apsara expressed regret for her wrongdoing and pleaded for mercy, Brahma relented and modified the curse. He said, ‘You will get back your original form when you touch the <em>payasam</em> that Agni Deva will give to King Dasharatha. Till then, you will roam the earth in the form of a bird’.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/008.jpg" alt="Anjaneya born" />
			</figure>
			<p>The apsara who was now transformed into the kite, was eager to be freed from the curse and therefore remained vigilant for that appropriate moment that would liberate her. The opportune moment presented itself when Dasharatha performed the yajna. The kite snatched the <em>payasam</em> from Sumitra’s hand. As soon as the kite held the bowl of pudding in its hand, it regained its original form and became transformed into the apsara. In the process however, the <em>payasam</em> fell from the bird’s grip. Vayu, the Wind God, upon instructions from Shiva acted with alertness. Before it could fall to the ground, he blew it gently towards the forest where Anjana and Kesari lived. He promptly delivered the pudding into Anjana’s hand.</p>
			<p>Anjana felt something brush her hands. When she saw the <em>payasam</em> in her palm, she and Kesari were puzzled over its sudden appearance. Just then they heard a heavenly voice, ‘Anjana, this is a special offering for you from the gods. While it has the power of the mighty Vayu, it contains the essence of Shiva. Partake of it and you will be blessed with a strong, healthy and courageous son who is an incarnation of Shiva’.</p>
			<p>The couple was happy to hear this prophecy. Kesari beamed at Anjana as she reverentially swallowed the divine potion.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Anjaneya is born</h2>
			<p>On a bright and sunny day between Vasanta and Greeshma seasons, at a propitious time, Anjana gave birth to a beautiful male child who exhibited several signs of divinity. He was big with broad shoulders and had a radiant face with prominent cheeks. He had auspicious signs on the soles of his feet that had long toenails and sported a huge tail. He arrived draped in silken robes with the <em>yajnopavitha</em> or the sacred thread, in golden colour running from his shoulder across his chest. He was decked in finery from head to toe. He was born with a glittering crown that was embedded with diamonds and other precious stones. Anklets and other ornaments wearing which he made his grand entry into this world, added to his natural luminescence.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/009.jpg" alt="Anjaneya born" />
			</figure>
			<p>The robust child was ushered into the world with spectacular celebrations. While the gods showered flowers upon the heavenly baby, heaven and earth were agog with the play of celestial musical instruments. Sages and seers who were engaged in meditation, and the virtuous and godly beings, witnessed good omens, while ogres and devils experienced ominous signs that spelt doom and destruction.</p>
			<p>There was much jubilation and fanfare, in the midst of which, the newborn was named. He was christened Anjaneya, the son of Anjana. Though Anjaneya was an incarnation of Shiva, he came to be known by several names because he embodied aspects of all gods. He was variously known as Sankarsuta, Parvatinandana, Kesari Nandan. Since Vayu had played a major role in his conception, he was named Vayuputra, Pavanasuta, Maruti and Anilakumara, meaning, the son of Vayu. Anjaneya also came to be called Bala Brahmachari or child celibate because he was born with the sacred thread on his body. Agni, the Fire God, also became a foster father to Hanuman because he had been instrumental in bringing the bowl of 1payasam in the first instance.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Anjana leaves for Brahmaloka</h2>
			<p>Anjana was liberated from her curse once she gave birth to Anjaneya. She desired to return to Brahmaloka. Anjaneya was saddened by Anjana’s decision. He made all efforts to cajole her to stay back with him. ‘If you go away, who will feed me? How will I live alone and grow up without a mother?’ Anjaneya wailed.</p>
			<p>‘You are a very strong and brave boy. You will have two fathers to take care of you – Kesari and Vayu. They will protect you. And whenever you are hungry, eat fruits that are ripe and red as the rising sun’. Anjana comforted Anjaneya with kind but firm words.</p>
			<p>However, before she kissed him goodbye and left for Brahmaloka, Anjana added: ‘And, yes, my son. I am going to place a responsibility on your young shoulders. After you complete your formal education, I desire that you meet my brother Sugreeva and serve him as his minister and savior. Vaali, the son of Indra, and Sugreeva, the son of Surya, are my foster brothers. They were brought up by my parents Gautama rishi and Ahalya. Though my brothers shared immense affection for each other, they are now sworn enemies because of a misunderstanding that arose between them. Though both of them are very courageous, Vaali’s capabilities became enhanced by a boon he was granted. Consequently, anyone who fights with him in single-combat will lose half his strength to him! But, whereas Sugreeva is pious, Vaali has detracted from the righteous path. He not only forcefully took his brother’s wife after banishing him from the kingdom, but he also intends to kill Sugreeva. You should therefore protect Sugreeva. While discharging your duty towards him, you will get the opportunity to meet your Lord and serve him. Thereby you will fulfill your life’s mission’.</p>
			<p>‘I will do as you say, mother,’ Anjaneya promised his mother. Anjana then bid farewell to her little son and left for Brahmaloka.</p>

		<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-001.09">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">How Anjaneya came to be named Hanuman</h2>
			<p>One day Anjaneya woke up from sleep feeling ravenous. He looked around for something to eat when he spotted the bright red sun on the sky. He remembered his mother’s words: ‘whenever you feel hungry, take the fruits which are as red and ripe as the rising sun’. The glowing sun looked like a fruit to little Anjaneya.</p>
			<p>‘It looks so big and red! It is sure to be sweet and juicy. Well, unless I try eating it, how would I know its taste! Okay, let me go for it’. Anjaneya decided that the lustrous and red spherical object above was a huge, luscious fruit. Determined to have it, he leaped high in the air and sped towards the sun. Since he was a divine child with powerful parentage, he inherited the magical powers of Anjana, Kesari, Vayu and Agni. He raced towards the sun with the speed of Vayu himself, and the heat of the fiery planet above, had no effect on him.</p>
			<p>Surya Deva the Sun God who was blazing gloriously on the horizon, wondered at the monkey who was approaching him. He was bewildered when he saw the creature increase in size as it came closer to him. Surya who was stunned into disbelief and inaction, called out to Indra, the God of Thunder and Rain for help. But Anjaneya was too quick for him; he pounced upon him. With a single swift movement, he grabbed Surya and stuffed him into his mouth!</p>
			<p>It was the day of solar eclipse and Rahu was on his way to possess the Sun. When Anjaneya spotted Rahu, he assumed the object to be a black fruit. He dashed towards Rahu, who sensed trouble and rushed to Indra for help.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Indra who had heard Surya’s shouts, was surprised to hear the Sun-God screaming for help. ‘I wonder what ails Surya! Is he not capable of scorching anything or anyone who dares to come near him? Let me see what the matter is!’ As Indra prepared to go to the Sun’s rescue, a panic-stricken Rahu rushed towards him.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/010.jpg" alt="Hanuman surya" />
			</figure>
			<p>‘Who is this monkey fellow who is rivalling me to possess Surya? I just escaped being grasped by him,’ Rahu wailed. Indra promptly mounted Airavatha, his grand white elephant and left his abode to find the cause of all this chaos.</p>
			<p>When Indra saw the gigantic monkey, he bellowed, ‘Who are you? Why have you trapped the Sun in your mouth?’ Anjaneya fearlessly answered Indra. ‘I’m Anjaneya, son of Kesari and Anjana. My mother told me to eat fruits that are ripe and red as the sun. So, I’m now going to eat my fruit!’ ‘But he is no fruit Anjaneya. He is Surya, the source of all light and life. Leave him alone and go back to where you’ve come from,’ Indra explained to Hanuman.</p>
			<p>But the mischievous lad turned a deaf ear to Indra’s words and refused to let go of Surya. Rather, he turned his attention to Airavata who he decided was a yummy white fruit! When Indra saw Anjaneya charge towards his mount, he hurled a weapon at him. With a mere hair follicle, Anjaneya stopped the weapon midway. Indra who was now raging with fury, threw the Brahmastra against the young boy. It met the same fate as the earlier weapon.</p>
			<p>Brahma and the other gods who now gathered at the site, began to plead with Anjaneya. They said, ‘Oh son of Anjana and Vayu, you are born blessed, endowed with immense power and strength. You should use your power for the welfare of mankind, sages and gods. Your father Vayu provides life for all existence. Now you have grabbed Surya and have caused all sacred activities to come to a halt. We beg you to release him’.</p>
			<p>Anjaneya who had had his share of fun, released Surya and all the gods were happy. Indra, however, was not to be appeased. He was smarting from the insult that a chit of a boy had wrought on him by belittling his sacred weapons.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/011.jpg" alt="Anjaneya sun" />
			</figure>
			<p>‘I will teach this youngster a lesson! I shall show him who I am, how powerful and superior I am!’ Indra said to himself. He observed Anjaneya, smug after his recent jaunts, sitting distracted. Perhaps, he was plotting more mischief. Indra who wielded the <em>Vajrayudha</em>, his thunderbolt, grabbed this opportunity and struck Anjaneya with it. The youngster was caught unawares as the weapon hit his jaw and he went hurtling down to the earth. He fell with a heavy thud on the ground, unconscious. His jaws turned red with blood.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/012.jpg" alt="Anjaneya Indra" />
			</figure>
			<p>Vayu was horrified to see his beloved son fall down, wounded and lifeless. ‘Who has done this to you, my child? I will destroy everything and everyone for causing this grave injury to my precious little boy,’ Vayu ranted in agony when he saw his son lie inert. He gently picked Anjaneya in his arms and went down to Paataala, seven worlds below the earth!</p>
			<p>As soon as Vayu disappeared into Paataala, there was utter chaos on earth as there was no air for living beings to breathe. Humans, animals and plants struggled to stay alive and became motionless. A panic-stricken Surya rushed to Brahma for help. After narrating the turn of events to him, Surya said, ‘O Creator of the Universe, you have to rescue the Earth from Vayu’s wrath, else there’ll soon be no life anywhere’.</p>
			<p>Brahma was worried and concerned. He reprimanded Indra for his rash act. Indra regretted acting in haste. He accompanied Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu, all other gods, celestial beings, siddhas and rishis, to Paataala. They tried to appease Vayu and sought his return to earth.</p>
			<p>Brahma sprinkled holy water upon Anjaneya and with the power of mantras revived him and healed his wounds. In the midst of all those present, he then declared, ‘Vayu, I bless your son with immortality; he will be <em>Chiranjeevi!</em>’</p>
			<p>Brahma added, ‘I also place around his neck, this diamond necklace, the highest benediction he can get. He will remain the eternal servant of the Lord who alone will recognize this necklace in time. The Lord and your son will mutually recognize each other at the appropriate hour’.</p>
			<p>Indra and the other gods soon followed Brahma in bestowing boons and blessings on Anjaneya. They blessed him with a long life, strength, health, valour, knowledge, piety, intellect, gift of good speech, compassion, invincibility against attack by divine or satanic forces, and great devotion towards lord Vishnu.</p>
			<p>‘None will ever be able to match you in strength and speed,’ they said.</p>
			<p>Each of the gods showered attributes upon Anjaneya that would ensure his immortality and invincibility against all forces.</p>
			<p>‘May you have the ability to shrink or increase your size at will,’ said one of them.</p>
			<p>‘I bestow upon you the capacity to become weightless or assume any weight as you may deem necessary,’ added another.</p>
			<p>‘I endow you with skills to take leaps across oceans and mountains to reach wherever you want, and acquire anything you desire,’ said another god.</p>
			<p>‘May you attain mastery over all creatures and be blessed with divine powers to create and destroy, for the welfare of the good and righteous’ joined in another.</p>
			<p>Agni, the Fire God said, ‘You will remain indestructible by fire!’</p>
			<p>‘You will remain immortal, unscathed by time,’ added <em>Kaal</em>, the keeper of Time.</p>
			<p>Vayu too blessed Anjaneya with speed that would be greater than his own!</p>
			<p>Surya, the Sun God said, ‘I bestow upon you a hundredth part of my brilliance. In addition, at the appropriate time, I shall impart to you the knowledge of the Vedas and the Shastras. No one, absolutely no one, will then be able to match your knowledge of these subjects’.</p>
			<p>Indra too graced Anjaneya, ‘You will remain invincible, not only against my Vajrayudha, but against every kind of weapon. I also give you the name 1Hanuman, ‘one with a broken jaw’, because your strong jaws have become disfigured with the blow from my thunderbolt. You will achieve great glory and fame as 1Hanuman, the most devout devotee of Lord Vishnu’.</p>
			<p>In Sanskrit ‘hanu’ means ‘jaw’ and ‘man’ means ‘disfigured’. Anjaneya received the moniker Hanuman, and true to Indra’s words, gained immeasurable fame as Lord Rama’s unparalleled 1bhakta or devotee.</p>
			<p>The Wind God, Vayu was satisfied when the gods made amends for Indra’s impulsive act. He emerged from Paataala much to everyone’s relief and joy. A pleasant breeze restored life to normalcy in all the three worlds.</p>
