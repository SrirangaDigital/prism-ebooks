			<p>Hanuman grew up to be a hearty and healthy prankster, full of mischief. He had herculean strength even as a child. When he was barely ten years old, he could lift huge mountains and hurl them like pebbles! There were occasions when he would assume the physical form of a giant or an insect to save himself from attack by monsters.</p>
			<p>With his abounding energy and mischievous disposition, Hanuman did not spare even the rishis and munis. He teased and disturbed them while they meditated and obstructed their sacrificial performances. He would tug at their hair, break their pots and vessels, run away with their 1puja items or hide them. Despite this, he endeared himself to all the sages who realized his divine nature. They were aware of the boons conferred upon him and his importance in events that were to occur in the future. However, after a while, even they could not deal with his tomfoolery. His antics were becoming unbearable. They decided to cast a spell on him.</p>
			<p>One of the rishis, talking on behalf of all of them, said, ‘You naughty boy, you ought to be put in place! We hereby pronounce that you will not be able to remember your own abilities unless someone else reminds you about them!’</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman seeks a boon from sage Narada</h2>
			<p>However, nothing stopped the impish Hanuman from being naughty. His exploits as a young lad were many. When he met the singing minstrel Narada for the first time, he offered his respects to him, and then stopped him on his path.</p>
			<p>‘I hear you are a great rishi. You must give me your blessings,’ Hanuman told him.</p>
			<p>‘What may I bless you with?’ asked Narada in response.</p>
			<p>‘Since I already have several blessings given to me by gods and demigods, I cannot think of anything. Why don’t you think of something that I do not possess and bless me with it!’ Hanuman replied.</p>
			<p>Narada pondered for a while and then came up with an idea.</p>
			<p>‘Okay son, I hereby declare that you will be an expert musician. For, this is the only talent you lack’.</p>
			<p>‘Well, that’s fine, but you are the musical genius. I learn from my father that you are the best in the field. Now if I have to be the expert, I need to be better than you! How will you ensure that?’ Hanuman quizzed Narada.</p>
			<p>‘Okay, go ahead and sing while I sit here and listen to you,’ replied Narada.</p>
			<p>As Narada placed his veena on a rock and sat down to enjoy Hanuman singing, the youngster began to sing in a rich and resonating voice. Narada, and Nature itself, listened in blissful silence, to Hanuman’s rendition. So soulful was his singing that the rock on which Narada placed his veena, melted. The instrument floated gracefully as if in rhythm to the divine music. Narada who had his eyes closed as he became immersed in the melody, pronounced, ‘Okay Hanuman, you are the best musician. You may now stop singing as you have proved yourself,’ said Narada.</p>

			<p>But Hanuman was insistent. ‘Please sir, first open your eyes and proclaim me as the expert musician,’ he said.</p>
			<p>When Narada opened his eyes, he did not observe that his veena was floating in liquid.</p>
			<p>‘Okay Hanuman, you are the best in the field. You may stop singing and allow me to proceed on my path,’ said Narada.</p>
			<p>Hanuman stopped singing. Instantaneously, the liquid on which the veena was floating, transformed back to the rock. But the veena was stuck on it!</p>
			<p>When Narada tried to pick up his instrument, he found that he could not budge it! ‘What have you done to my veena, you naughty child?’ Narada asked of Hanuman.</p>
			<p>Even as Hanuman professed his innocence in the matter, Narada divined that it was the boy’s soul-stirring music that had caused this magical phenomenon. He therefore asked Hanuman to render the same piece of music so as to retrieve his veena.</p>
			<p>Hanuman ignored Narada’s pleas; instead he jumped and danced and ran inside his abode. Narada followed him and continued pleading with him. Just then Hanuman’s father Kesari came out to see what the noise was all about. He gently chided Hanuman for his pranks and said, ‘Hanuman, I command you to release Narada’s veena!’</p>
			<p>‘I did this to ensure that every part of our dwelling is sanctified by the great sage’s holy feet as he walks into it. I will now release his veena because my purpose is achieved and he has blessed our environs with his sacred presence,’ Hanuman said, bowing before Narada in utmost reverence.</p>
			<p>As Narada took leave of Hanuman and Kesari, he assured Hanuman, ‘You are already blessed because you will eternally serve Lord Rama’.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman trains under Surya</h2>
			<p>Hanuman upon whom the gods had bestowed several benedictions, decided he wanted formal education. He approached his father Kesari and said, ‘Father, I wish to gain knowledge from a teacher like all the other children do. Place me under the guidance of a noble guru,’</p>
			<p>‘You are uncontrollably naughty. Who will be prepared to accept you as his pupil? Where will I go looking for a guru who will be willing to teach you?’ Kesari teased his son. ‘I suggest you approach Surya, the Sun god whom you once grabbed. Ask him if he would be willing to teach you. He is most powerful and he may consider your request since he had promised to impart knowledge to you at the appropriate time’.</p>
			<figure>

			<p>His father’s suggestion appealed to Hanuman. He proceeded to meet Surya. The Sun god looked splendid and radiant in all finery as he sat on his stately chariot, harnessed to seven mighty horses. Several hundreds of thousands of rishis were sitting before him, reciting the Vedas in unison.</p>
			<p>When he saw Hanuman walk towards him, Surya wondered, ‘Now what is Hanuman up to?</p>
			<p>Perhaps he is done with the years of mischief-mongering now that he is grown!’</p>
			<p>‘Whom are you going to swallow now, young lad?’ Surya asked Hanuman in jest.</p>
			<p>Hanuman was a picture of complete humility as he paid his obeisance to Surya, and addressed him respectfully, ‘Oh, that was ignorance on my part. I know that you are a treasure chest of knowledge beyond compare. Therefore, I am now here to learn from you. I desire to be your disciple’ said Hanuman.</p>
			<p>‘I would have taken you most willingly as my student. Unfortunately, as you can see here, there is no vacant seat where you may sit,’ Surya replied. He wished to test Hanuman’s earnestness in the matter.</p>
			<p>‘That is no problem; I will stand and learn from you,’ Hanuman answered, without thinking for a moment.</p>
			<p>‘To keep the world going and the seasons changing, I need to constantly move. But if you stand in front of me, I will not be able to move,’ explained Surya.</p>
			<p>‘Well, then I will move along with you and learn in the process,’ said Hanuman, determined to gain knowledge from Surya.</p>
			<p>Surya who was convinced of Hanuman’s seriousness, was happy to keep the word he had given the lad several years ago. ‘Okay. I agree to take you as my student on a condition that when you face me, you should move backwards. And I will not repeat what I say. So, you have to listen carefully to what I teach’.</p>
			<p>Hanuman accepted every condition that Surya placed before him. He also expressed his gratitude for providing him the opportunity to train under him. Thus, Hanuman began his tutelage under the brilliant Surya. Hanuman was a keen and intelligent learner who absorbed in no time, whatever his guru taught him. He mastered the purport and import of the Vedas. His grasp of the Sanskrit language and its grammar, were impeccable.</p>

			<figure>

			</figure>
			<p>When Hanuman had learned all he could at Surya’s gurukul and was ready to leave, he expressed his keen desire to offer guru dakshina to Surya for the invaluable education he had obtained from him.</p>
			<p>‘O great teacher, though I shall never be able to recompense you for the learning you have imparted to me, I wish to offer a small token as guru dakshina. What may I offer you for the purpose?’</p>
			<p>Hanuman asked Surya, palms joined and head bowed in esteemed reverence to his teacher.</p>
			<p>Surya now remembered the prophetic words once uttered to him by Brahma. The creator had said, ‘A great monkey by name Hanuman will be born on earth by the energy of Lord Shiva. He will perform the divine task of establishing dharma, the righteousness in the world. He will even try to swallow you, believing you to be a fruit. He will be the eternal consort of your daughter’.</p>
			<p>Without hesitation, Surya asked Hanuman to wed his daughter Suvarchala. ‘This will be the guru dakshina,’ Surya told Hanuman.</p>
			<p>Hanuman, was in a dilemma. ‘Great Sir, but you know I have vowed celibacy for life. How then can I marry your daughter?’</p>
			<p>Surya immediately replied: ‘Young man, you are an incarnation of Lord Shiva who saved the universe by drinking the poisonous Haalaahala that emerged from the churning of the ocean. You are also the son of Agni, the fire god. Suvarchala is a part of my luminescence and you alone can withstand it. Hence I offer my daughter in marriage to you. Further, I bestow upon you the celibate state even after your marriage to her. Suvarchala is a divine lady who will be a devoted wife to you and your marriage to her is solely for the welfare of the Universe’.</p>
			<p>Hanuman was convinced. At the appropriate age when he was ready to tie the knot, Hanuman wed Suvarchala at the propitious hour on an auspicious day, thereby paying his guru dakshina.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Story of Suvarchala</h2>
			<p>How was Suvarchala conceived, and how did she come to be Surya’s daughter? Suvarchala’s birth has its origins at the time of the creation of the universe. When Brahma created the Cosmos, the Sun god was in his most ferocious form, blazing with unbearable light and heat. Even his wife Sanjana could not bear to go near him for such was the intensity of heat and light with which he glowed. Sanjana who was distressed at this, expressed the unhappy situation to her mother who in turn confided the same to Sanjana’s father, Vishwakarma, the divine architect.</p>
			<p>Vishwakarma immediately sought out his son-in-law Surya and discussed the issue with him. He asked Surya to polish off some of his luminescence. Surya readily agreed to reduce his heat and brightness to a tolerable level. Consequently, Suvarchala emerged as Surya’s daughter, the separated aspect of his luminosity. The name Suvarchala comes from ‘varcha’, varchala meaning ‘luminosity’ and ‘su’ from Surya, the Sun. Thus, Suvarchala means ‘the luminosity of the sun’. All the celestial beings who were mesmerized by her radiant beauty approached Brahma and asked him about this divine child and her future.</p>
			<p>It was then that Brahma predicted that in time she would come to be the spouse of Hanuman an aspect of Shiva, who would be the foster son of Agni. Brahma said, ‘Since Hanuman tried to grab the lustrous Sun, he alone can withstand this fiery young woman’. Since then, Surya patiently and eagerly awaited the arrival of Hanuman so that he could give his daughter’s hand in marriage to him.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>On the completion of his education, Hanuman sought the blessings of his guru Surya, took leave of him and returned home. As Hanuman contemplated his next move in life, he recalled his mother’s parting words to him – on how he should seek out and protect her brother Sugreeva from her other brother Vaali.</p>
			<p>Hanuman who was devoted to his parents, prostrated in his mind’s eye before his mother and sought her blessings to enable him fulfill her wish. Anjana’s plan of action for her son fitted well into the scheme of things that his father Kesari had envisioned for him.</p>
			<p>Kesari advised Hanuman: ‘Son, now that you have learned all that you could from Surya, it is time you gained some knowledge of politics as well. I suggest you meet Sugreeva and assist him in his battle against his brother Vaali. You may now proceed to Pampapur where Sugreeva lives and gain this experience’.</p>
			<p>Hanuman was doubly happy. For, in fulfilling his parents’ wishes, he would also be serving his teacher Surya by assisting his son Sugreeva. He set off for Pampapur to meet Sugreeva.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Birth of Vaali and Sugreeva</h2>
			<p>Brahma once came down to Earth and made Mount Meru his temporary abode. As he was resting one day, a tear drop escaped from his eye and fell down upon the glistening mountain peak. Instantly, a male monkey was born of the drop! Brahma named him Riksharaja.</p>
			<p>Riksharaja grew into a handsome simian. As he bent down to drink water from a lake one day, he was amazed to see another creature vying for the water. Riksharaja did not realize the ‘creature’ to be his own reflection! He immediately dived into the water to thrash his rival and drive him away from the area. When he realized there was nobody in the lake, he emerged from its water. As soon as he stepped on land, he became transformed into a supremely beautiful lady.</p>
			<p>Coincidentally, Indra and Surya who were passing by the lake at that time were at once struck by the lady’s beauty! Both of them sought to covet Riksharaja in his female form. Their intimacy with her resulted in the birth of two fine-looking sons. As the female Riksharaja lovingly took her sons in her arms and gave them a bath in the lake, the babies splashed water on her in fun. And lo! Riksharaja was once again transformed into the male monkey!</p>
			<p>He carried his sons to Brahma who named the elder boy, Indra’s son as Vaali, and Surya’s child as Sugreeva. Brahma then created an entire troop of monkeys to inhabit the forest which was called Kishkinda, and bestowed kingship upon Riksharaja. Indra presented his son Vaali a garland of golden lotuses before leaving for his own abode.</p>

			<p>Riksharaja who was a just and good ruler, became busy with the administration of his newly established kingdom, that he could not give his children enough time. He desired that his sons get good breeding. He therefore entrusted them to the care of the great sage Gautama and his wife Ahalya.</p>
			<p>Vaali and Sugreeva grew up as Anjana’s foster brothers in the home of Gautama till such time that Time strode upon Riksharaja. When the monarch realized his end was approaching, he sought Brahma’s permission to summon Vaali and Sugreeva from Gautama’s hermitage. In keeping with tradition, he relinquished his kingship and crowned his elder son Vaali, as ruler of Kishkinda and Sugreeva as Crown Prince.</p>
