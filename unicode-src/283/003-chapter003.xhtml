		<p>Hanuman’s search for Sugreeva ended when he met him at Rishyamukha Hill in Pampa region. Sugreeva had fallen out with his brother Vaali following a misunderstanding between them and was banished from the kingdom. Sugreeva, accompanied by many of his followers, took refuge in Rishyamukha since it was out of bounds for Vaali. Vaali had on a certain occasion unwittingly incurred the wrath of sage Matanga. The sage cursed him saying that he would meet his end if he dared to set foot on the hill where his hermitage was located.</p>

		<p>Sugreeva welcomed Hanuman with open arms and soon became impressed with his radiant intelligence, calm disposition, quick wit and abundant commonsense. Hanuman became Sugreeva’s chief minister and confidante.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman’s first meeting with Rama</h2>
		<p>Meanwhile Rama and Lakshmana who were desperately searching for Sita in the forests following her abduction by Ravana, reached the banks of the Pampa river. They came to Pampa following the advice and suggestion of the dying Jatayu, the vulture who was a dear friend of Rama’s father, King Dasaratha. The great vulture-warrior informed Rama that Ravana had travelled south with Sita after mortally injuring him when he had tried to rescue her.</p>
		<p>Rama and Lakshmana, clad in clothes of bark and wielding an array of weapons, appeared menacing to Sugreeva who spotted them from atop Rishyamukha hill.</p>
		<p>‘These men must be Vaali’s spies in disguise,’ Sugreeva ranted. He was worried that his brother was planning an attack on him. Since this fear took deep roots in his mind, Sugreeva, along with his vanara force began to move from one peak to another to escape them.</p>
		<p>‘It does not befit a king of your courage and stature to act without calm and rationale. As our leader you should inspire us and keep us from getting into a state of panic. Instead, you are wavering and acting in a typical simian manner. Have you forgotten that not even the tip of Vaali’s finger can touch you so long as we remain here?’ Hanuman politely and gently reasoned with Sugreeva.</p>
		<p>‘I guess you are right Hanuman. Nevertheless, I want to be certain that we are not under any threat. Why don’t you find out who these two men are?’ Sugreeva responded.</p>
		<p>Hanuman set out to perform the task set before him by Sugreeva. He took one giant leap from the hill to the riverside where Rama and Lakshmana were resting. However, before approaching them, he secured his position by assuming the form of a mendicant.</p>
		<p>Hanuman felt a wave of exhilaration when he came face-to-face with Rama and Lakshmana. He prostrated before the brothers and subsequently addressed them most reverentially with folded palms. On the one hand he was very shrewd and perceptible to note that they were of noble birth and could not be Vaali’s spies in disguise, and on the other hand, he also recalled his mother’s words as she bid him serve Sugreeva, ‘By discharging your duty towards him, you will meet your Lord’. Hanuman was overcome by a profound sense of devotion towards Rama as he instinctually recognized him as his Lord!</p>
		<p>He spoke to the brothers in chaste Sanskrit. His choice of words and expressions were flawless and perfect, as in the scriptures.</p>
		<p>‘May I have the pleasure of knowing who you are? Though you are attired like ascetics, in clothes of bark, you look glorious and divine, like royal seers or gods. Though the weapons you carry induce fear in the creatures of the woods here, your charming demeanour and effulgent presence illuminates this very place upon which you stand’. Hanuman continued to extol their appearance and virtues.</p>
		<p>Rama did not respond to Hanuman’s questions. Instead he asked, ‘What kind of beggar are you – you wear a beautiful necklace on your neck?’ Hanuman felt goose pimples all over his body. He was doubly sure that this was his Lord, the Lord who Brahma had referred to in his childhood!</p>
		<p>Hanuman immediately fell at Rama’s feet and revealed his true identity and the purpose of his presence before them.</p>
		<p>‘I am Hanuman, the son of Anjana and the brave vanara chief, Kesari. Surya and Agni are my godfathers. I am here to serve Sugreeva, the chief of the vanaras. I am capable of transforming myself to any form I wish, and I have come here at his bidding, for he sincerely seeks your friendship. Now that I have told you everything about myself, I humbly request your kind response,’ Hanuman disclosed.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman takes Rama and Lakshmana to Sugreeva</h2>
		<p>Rama was astonished and highly impressed by the way in which Hanuman spoke and conducted himself. He turned towards Lakshmana and said, ‘None, unless he has mastered the Vedas and Sanskrit, can speak the way Hanuman does!’ Rama then introduced</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/019.jpg" alt="Hanuman Rama" />
		</figure>
		<p> Lakshmana and himself to Hanuman and informed him that they were here in search of the very Sugreeva about whom Hanuman had just spoken.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/020.jpg" alt="Hanuman Lakshmana" />
		</figure>
		<p>‘We were told that Sugreeva would help us in our search for my beloved wife Sita,’ said Rama. The brothers then narrated in brief their circumstance, of how they came to be in exile in the forests and how Sita had been kidnapped by Ravana.</p>
		<p>Hanuman who listened to Rama in rapt attention, perceived that a friendship between Rama and Sugreeva would be to their mutual advantage. He said, ‘Kindly perch yourselves on my shoulders and I will take you to meet my chief, Sugreeva’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman ensured the brothers were safely seated on his shoulders. With the speed of wind, he immediately took off for Rishyamukha Hill where Sugreeva was impatiently awaiting his return. As soon as the three of them reached their destination, Hanuman made due introductions. He then related to Sugreeva, Rama’s predicament and how he was desperately looking for Sita who had been carried away by the demon king of Lanka.</p>
		<p>Sugreeva welcomed Rama and Lakshmana with due respect. Once he made his guests comfortable, Sugreeva recounted to Rama his own tale of woe. He narrated to him, how his brother Vaali had misunderstood him and declared him to be his sworn enemy. After exchanging notes in this manner, Rama and Sugreeva, in the presence of those around, took the vow of friendship and a pledge to assist each other in fulfilling their respective missions. Hanuman lit the fire, and Agni became the supreme witness to the pact of friendship between Rama and Sugreeva. While Sugreeva promised Rama all help in finding Sita, Rama gave his word to Sugreeva that he would kill Vaali in battle and restore the kingdom of Kishkinda to him. Thus, Hanuman brought together the king of men, and the king of monkeys, in the bond of friendship.</p>
		<p>True to his word, Rama slayed Vaali as soon as the opportunity presented itself. Vaali’s wife Tara who was devoted to her husband was devastated at his death. The shrewd Hanuman who had immense foresight, wanted to ensure that Tara would not curse Sugreeva and act in a manner that would be detrimental to him and also be against the precepts of Dharma. He pacified Tara with appropriate words and gained her confidence. He beseeched her to keep the interests of her son Angada in the forefront of whatever she did. He won her over with his fine and precise words. The astute Hanuman quelled any rebellion or threat even before it could take shape.</p>
		<p>Sugreeva was crowned king. By then, the monsoons had set in and Sugreeva assured Rama that he would mobilize his vanara force and begin the search for Sita once the rainy season abated. However, Sugreeva who was enjoying his newfound kingship, failed to take measures to find Sita even after the rains stopped. Hanuman politely reminded his king of his responsibility.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman and his team head south to look for Sita </h2>
		<p>Sugreeva who realized his mistake, soon assembled his troops and drew up an action plan to look for Sita. The entire vanara force from everywhere joined hands with Sugreeva in his noble mission. All the other inhabitants of the jungle chipped in their bit and threw their might behind the simian army. Sugreeva divided his battalion into eight divisions and dispatched them to look for Sita in different directions. Hanuman headed southwards, along with veteran Jambavanth the mighty ruler of bears, Angada the son of Vaali and Nila the powerful son of the fire god.</p>
		<p>Sugreeva who had supreme confidence in Hanuman’s prowess and abilities, wished him success on the mission. ‘Hanuman, no creation of Brahma can equal you in wisdom, strength, energy, power and prudence. You are not only virtuous, but you have rare intellect and are also well versed in the art of behavior and conduct appropriate to situations. None in all the three worlds can obstruct your path through these regions as you are very familiar with the terrain and topography of the route you are to take. Oh! gallant son of Vayu, you have indomitable courage and exceptional skill. I repose complete faith in you, for I know you will return triumphant in this noble task assigned to you!’</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/021.jpg" alt="Rama Lakshamana Hanuman" />
		</figure>
		<p>Rama who heard Sugreeva openly praise Hanuman in such glowing terms, felt overwhelmed by a sense of elation. His morale and confidence were immeasurably boosted; he felt as if Hanuman had already discovered Sita! He handed over to Hanuman his finger ring with his name engraved on it. ‘Give this to Sita as a token of identification so that she feels assured that you are my messenger. I feel highly encouraged by Sugreeva’s words. I am sure that with your extraordinary might, you will succeed in this operation. It is upon you that I depend, to get my dear Sita back!’</p>
		<p>Hanuman who took the ring from Rama, bowed humbly before him. He sought Rama’s blessings for success in the mission and took leave of him.</p>
		<p>The task before Hanuman and his team was daunting. It involved leaping over some of the highest mountains and crossing rivers, many of which were infested with alligators and other deadly marine creatures. The mountains were densely forested and ridden with huge serpents. Hanuman and his men combed these mountains, rivers and cities in their neighbourhood, looking for Sita.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.005">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman and the monkeys meet Swayamprabha</h2>
		<p>Hanuman and his force were soon running out of time. The deadline set by Sugreeva for locating Sita was fast approaching but they did not have the slightest clue to her whereabouts. They scoured every inch of every mountain, forest, cave and river they came upon, dealing with wild animals on the way. They often had to overcome problems caused by impenetrable jungle tracts that were hugely cavernous. The monkey force was beginning to get demoralized. Their fervent search for Sita had yielded no result and they were famished without food or water and suffered extreme fatigue. But Hanuman remained determined and was undaunted by the difficulties that came their way. He tried to keep up the sagging spirits of his team. Fortunately, one of the monkeys spotted the entrance to a huge cave from which birds appeared to fly out with wet feet. The vanara shrieked in delight and summoned his teammates. ‘Look at these birds. Do their feet not appear wet? There must be a water source somewhere close by! Let us enter the cave and see if we can get some water. See! There are creepers and climbers that drape the cave, and they are looking as green as ever! I’m sure we’ll find water here. Come on, let us explore the cave’.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/022.jpg" alt="Sita" />
		</figure>
		<p>By virtue of the several boons that were granted to him, Hanuman could force his way through the toughest of terrains. The monkeys who were hopeful of finding water, followed him into the cave which was called Raksabila and was guarded by Maya, a demon. The grotto was pitch dark and appeared endlessly long. They had to hold on to each other to keep themselves from falling. Just as they were beginning to lose hope of finding any water, or even of getting out from this suffocating tunnel, they saw a streak of bright light. They moved forward faster in the direction of the beam and came upon an area that held them speechless and mesmerized.</p>
		<p>The monkeys beheld a most wondrous and lustrous sight. An entire city stretched out before them! A vast grove, blanketed with trees of gold, was in full bloom. The flowers filled the environs with their sweet fragrance. Farther ahead the vanaras spotted a pond in which lotus flowers of varied colours danced delicately. Its water glistened like crystals as the golden rays of the Sun caressed it with its gentle touch. The glitter of gold and silver was everywhere about them. The palaces, mansions and buildings were colourfully inlaid with gems and precious stones. The monkeys saw vast acres of orchards with trees whose branches bowed low with the weight of ripe fruits. In the midst of this paradise, the monkeys observed a short statured female ascetic, clad in bark, seated on deer skin. Her face radiated divine energy and her eyes shone with brilliance.</p>
		<p>With his palms folded, Hanuman bowed before the sage and addressed her in a respectful tone: ‘May we know who are, and to whom this cave and its riches belong?’</p>
		<p>The ascetic introduced herself to Hanuman as Swayamprabha and revealed to him that the cave was the creation of a demon named Maya. Maya who had practiced austerities in the grove for several hundreds of years, had obtained the range of skills, abilities and wealth of the great sage Sukra. This was a boon granted to him by Brahma. Maya showered affections upon a celestial nymph by name Hema. However, when Maya was killed by Indra, Brahma bestowed the vast grove and all the wealth within it, upon Hema. Swayamprabha briefly narrated the story of the cave and its environs to Hanuman and his men. In conclusion she said, ‘As Hema’s dear friend, I safeguard this region on her behalf,’</p>
		<p>Hanuman then explained to her the reason for his presence and that of his troop in that region. He told her that they had stumbled upon the cave by accident and had entered it hoping to quench their thirst. The kindly ascetic could see that the simians were exhausted and hungry. After Swayamprabha made sure that they were amply fed and rested, she guided them out of the cave. Hanuman who was grateful for her hospitality desired to do something for her as a token of gratitude.</p>
		<p>Swayamprabha appreciated Hanuman’s sentiments but declined to accept anything in return. ‘For one devoted to practicing austerities, I do not have need for anything. I wish you heroic monkeys success in your mission’.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Sampati reveals Sita’s whereabouts to the vanara army</h2>
		<p>Once the monkeys emerged out of the cave, they perched themselves on a tree laden with fruits and blossoms and savoured the scene before them. A vast blue, seamless ocean stretched out ahead of them. As far as their eyes could rove, they saw no shore.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/023.jpg" alt="Sugreeva" />
		</figure>
		<p>‘We have spent so much time inside the cave that we have gone past the deadline that Sugreeva set us to locate Sita,’ one of the monkeys rued.</p>
		<p>‘We have not found Sita. We cannot return to Kishkinda after failing in our mission,’ another monkey rejoined.</p>
		<p>‘Let us not return to Kishkinda to face Sugreeva’s wrath. Let us continue to stay in this cavern,’ opined another monkey.</p>
		<p>‘My uncle Sugreeva will certainly make dead meat of me for having failed to discharge my duty,’ roared Angada, their leader.</p>
		<p>Hanuman intervened and reasoned with Angada that Sugreeva was a just and kind leader who would not harm his nephew, and that they should return to Kishkinda.</p>
		<p>‘It is better that we starve to death rather than face Sugreeva’s anger at our failure,’ another monkey said emphatically. The monkeys agreed and decided to fast until death.</p>
		<p>Sampati, the vulture who was sitting on a peak close to the monkeys’ perch, was elated on seeing so many monkeys. He spoke aloud, ‘Oh, I can now have a hearty meal of so many monkeys’.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/024.jpg" alt="Vanaras" />
		</figure>
		<p>The vanaras who heard Sampati, became infuriated and depressed at once. Angada was rueful over their predicament. He cried in anguish. ‘Now we are all going to be destroyed. Our doom really began with Kaikeyi’s unjust demands. First a heartbroken King Dasharatha died. Then the brave Jatayu was mercilessly killed by Ravana. And now it is our turn to go their way! And all our efforts have been in vain for we have not been able to find Sita!’</p>
		<p>Sampati perked up his ears at the mention of his beloved brother, Jatayu’s name. Sampati learnt from Hanuman and the vanara force of how Jatayu had been killed by Ravana when he tried to rescue Sita. He was both, saddened and enraged when he heard the account of his brother’s unfortunate end. Sampati recalled having seen a gracefully attired lady being carried away by Ravana. When he heard the vanaras narrate Sita’s abduction by the demon, he now became certain that the lady he had seen was none other than Sita. He decided to help the monkeys in their mission.</p>
		<p>Sampati was blessed with extraordinary vision that enabled him to see objects and, events happening, a great distance away. He immediately told the simian troop, ‘Friends, from my perch here, I can see things happening at a distance of hundred yojanas away. I now behold a garden wherein I see a lady in captivity. She looks like the lady whom Ravana carried away. She must be Sita’. Sampati pointed his finger in the direction of Lanka.</p>
		<p>‘Make haste and conduct your search for Sita in that region. My intuition tells me that you will return to Kishkinda after meeting Sita and succeeding in your mission,’ Sampati advised the monkeys.</p>
		<p>The monkeys, with renewed vigour, charted out their strategy to access Lanka and meet Sita.</p>

	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.007">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Jambavan reminds Hanuman of his extraordinary powers</h2>
		<p>The vanara force was engaged in frenzied consultation. The task of crossing the mighty ocean seemed daunting. They wondered if any of them was capable of accomplishing it.</p>
		<p>Angada asked, ‘How can we cross this vast expanse of water? Who amongst us can leap across this ocean and return safe?’</p>
		<p>Each monkey proclaimed his capacity for the leap. Hanuman sat quiet, watching the raging conversation, without professing his own abilities. When the monkeys concluded that none among them was strong or skilled enough to bound over to Lanka and come back safely, Jambavan sprung a surprise on them.</p>
		<p>‘Why Hanuman, only you amongst us is capable of performing this stupendous feat! Have you forgotten the boon that you were granted whereby you can grow to any size you wish and leap across mountains and oceans, at speeds greater than even your father Vayu’s?’</p>
		<p>As soon as Jambavan spoke these words, Hanuman recollected the boons that were given to him, and all the unique powers he was endowed with. He was at once ready to take the huge leap to Lanka to find Mother Sita. Hanuman who was inspired by Jambavan’s words, assumed such a gigantic form that the rest of his team looked like Lilliputians beside him!</p>
		<p>The vanara army felt re-energized on hearing Jambavan. Their hopes soared when they saw the mighty Hanuman. They were enthusiastic to resume their search for Sita. They shouted in unison, ‘Yes, Hanuman, you can bound across to Lanka! You can! You can!’ They cheered loudly as Hanuman climbed Mount Mahendra and prepared to take-off. He himself looked like another massive mountain. As he pressed down his feet and hands in preparation for flight, Mount Mahendra shook. There was a thunderous sound as boulders got displaced and tumbled down the hill. Water cascaded from several peaks on the mountain and spread in fingers of streams. Wild animals trembled with fear and ran amok in all directions. Seers and gandharvas who lived on the slopes of the mountain ran for their lives as the beasts created a stampede. There was a shower of blossoms from the uprooted trees upon Hanuman as he flexed his muscles, heaved himself and was gloriously airborne.</p>

	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.008">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman overcomes hurdles on his way to Lanka</h2>
		<p>Hanuman coursed through the sky with single-mindedness of purpose, determined to reach Lanka as quickly as possible. The deity of the ocean over which Hanuman cruised, wanted Hanuman to be successful in his objective. He therefore requested Mount Mainaka who lay submerged in the ocean, to emerge out of the water and provide space for Hanuman to rest a while before continuing his journey to Lanka.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="Mount Mainaka" />
		</figure>
		<p>Mount Mainaka with its golden peaks, rose above the oceanic waters to offer respite to Hanuman. But the vanara viewed the mountain as an obstacle to his speedy progress towards Lanka. He therefore brushed it aside and continued to move swiftly. Mainaka who earnestly wished to help Hanuman, assumed the form of a human being and stood on his summit. He addressed Hanuman, ‘It is indeed a long and arduous journey that you are undertaking, in the service of Rama. I therefore request you to relax for a while on my peak before you journey ahead to Lanka. You will feel refreshed’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman politely declined Mainaka’s hospitality and said, ‘I am grateful to you for your kind and thoughtful offer. But we have already run out of time and I do not wish to delay further, my search for Sita. I do not wish to rest until I find her. Let me proceed to Lanka and reach there by nightfall’. Hanuman took leave of Mainaka and leaped skyward towards Lanka. But his trials were not yet over.</p>
		<p>He had barely covered some distance when a gargantuan ogre suddenly appeared before him and obstructed his path. ‘I am Surasa, the mother of the Nagas. I am going to devour you. Brahma has given me a boon that allows me to eat anyone who appears before me. Come, enter my mouth now’. The ugly-looking demon opened her mouth wide for Hanuman to enter.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/026.jpg" alt="Surasa" />
		</figure>
		<p>‘I am on an important mission, in the service of Rama. He is in great sorrow, having been separated from his dear wife Sita who has been abducted by Ravana, the king of Lanka. I am on my way to Lanka to look for her. I promise to enter your mouth on my return after meeting Sita’.</p>
		<p>Surasa who had actually been set up by the gods and gandharvas to ascertain Hanuman’s strength and endurance, refused to relent. ‘None can escape me according to the boon I have been granted. So, come on, and enter my mouth,’ she said.</p>
		<p>‘Well, if you must have your way, open your mouth wide enough for me to enter,’ Hanuman replied. He then increased his size to mighty proportions. Accordingly, the demon too opened her mouth wider. The clever Hanuman soon shrunk himself to the size of a thumb and entered Surasa’s huge mouth. He went in and came out of it before the demon realized that he had tricked her.</p>
		<p>‘I have now honoured your wish and am therefore free to continue on my way to Lanka,’ Hanuman said to Surasa.</p>
		<p>The celestial beings applauded Hanuman’s wit and courage. Hanuman resumed his passage to Lanka with greater speed than before. He zig-zagged his way through dense clouds that trailed behind him. Simhika, a demon who could transform herself to any form she wished, saw Hanuman’s large size. She was determined to have him for her meal. She tugged at his shadow. The demon’s action reduced Hanuman’s speed because he felt himself being pulled down, and he seemed powerless. He looked around to see the source of the obstacle. He soon identified her to be the awful ogress Simhika.</p>
		<p>Hanuman once again displayed wisdom. He assumed gigantic proportions to make her mimic his move. Once her mouth grew large enough, Hanuman reduced himself to an insignificant size and entered Simhika’s open mouth. He entered her body and with little effort, tore apart her vital organs with his sharp nails. He came out victorious and once again continued to navigate his way through unfriendly terrains towards Ravana’s kingdom.</p>
		<p>The celestial beings who had witnessed Hanuman’s ingenuity in tackling all the obstacles, commended him and said, ‘Your four predominant virtues of determination, vision, perception and skill, will certainly help you to succeed in all your undertakings. Go. Go ahead and accomplish your objective of finding Sita’.</p>
		<p>With greatly increased speed, Hanuman rode over the mammoth ocean waves and leaped over craggy mountains and finally reached the shores of Lanka. He perched himself on a treetop to catch his first glimpse of Lanka. Suspended on the peak of Mount Trikuta Ravana’s kingdom looked glorious and spectacular.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.009">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman enters Lanka</h2>
		<p>Hanuman looked lustrous as he stood on the mountain, adorned with a floral shower from its trees. He surveyed his surrounds and observed how verdant Lanka was, abounding in fruit and flower trees, gardens, streams, ponds and lakes. The chirping of birds was music to his ears. He stood entranced by the grandeur of the city that the divine architect Vishwakarma had built. Hanuman also noticed that Lanka was impregnably fortified to prevent enemy forces from penetrating it.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/027.jpg" alt="Lankasri" />
		</figure>
		<p>‘None other than Angada, Nila, Sugreeva …, can even reach this place which is so heavily guarded and well protected’. Hanuman thought to himself. He made a mental note of the handful of monkeys who could perhaps overcome the protective forces of Ravana’s Lanka and enter the city.</p>
		<p>‘Anyway, let me cross that bridge when I get to it. I must first find mother Sita’s whereabouts in this huge territory,’ Hanuman said to himself as he waited patiently for sunset, to enter Lanka and begin his search. As the pearly evening lights merged into the somber hues of twilight, Hanuman shrunk his size to that of a cat and walked on the outskirts of Lanka. He was mesmerized by the grandeur of the city that had massive mansions and multi-storey structures. Each building, each garden and every edifice in Lanka was a splendorous structure, embellished with silver, gold and precious stones. As the moonlight cast its mellow white glow over the city, Lanka sparkled with the beauty of a bride dazzlingly bejeweled and bedecked in ceremonial dress.</p>
		<p>Lankasri, the goddess of Lanka who saw the monkey trying to enter the city, immediately stood like a barrier before him. ‘Who are you and how dare you enter this mighty fortress of Ravana! For what purpose have you come here?’ she hollered. Her ugly form contorted to a more grotesque look as she spat the question at Hanuman.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was neither intimidated by her bizarre looks nor by her thundering voice. ‘I am fascinated by Lanka and I wish to explore and savour its beauty,’ Hanuman replied.</p>
		<p>‘But you cannot enter it so long as I stand guard upon it,’ retorted Lankasri. Hanuman, who was firm in his resolve to enter the city, did not budge. Lankasri struck him a violent blow.</p>
		<p>Hanuman balled up his fist and punched Lankasri with a force that was sufficient to take her by surprise and make her fall to the ground. The heroic vanara not only displayed compassion towards his opponent but was also chivalrous, not to grievously wound or kill a woman.</p>
		<p>Lankasri was shocked at the suddenness of the attack. At the same time, she remembered and recalled Brahma’s prophetic words to her: ‘Lanka and the demons inhabiting it will be destroyed when a mere monkey will overpower you!’</p>
		<p>The hitherto belligerent Lankasri now became apologetic and addressed Hanuman respectfully, ‘I am sure the time ordained for us to perish, has come. Ravana has courted this disaster upon himself and his kingdom, by abducting Sita. He has committed an unrighteous and dishonourable act. Oh! valiant monkey, go ahead. Enter Lanka and comb every corner of the city to discover the virtuous daughter of Janaka and accomplish the purpose for which you are here’.</p>
		<p>The route to enter Lanka was now clear for Hanuman. As night draped its cloak over the city, he stealthily stepped into it. He continued to be fascinated by the magnitude and grandeur of Ravana’s kingdom. There was gaiety and cheer everywhere. Melodious music wafted through the air and Hanuman heard peals of laughter as the ogres rejoiced with food and drinks. A wild cacophony of sounds emerged from Ravana’s magnificent gynaeceum as horses neighed, elephants trumpeted and the jewels sported by dancing female ogres tinkled like concert bells. The demon king’s land was well protected by guards, and spies who kept vigil in the guise of householders.</p>
		<p>A keen observer, Hanuman made a calculated survey of Ravana’s empire and lost no time in looking for Sita. He went from house to house, mansion to mansion, and even searched the royal gynaeceum and palace on the peak of Mt.Trikuta. As Hanuman continued to search each building, he came upon several female demons in an intoxicated state. They lay sprawled in their chambers with their robes disheveled and were of most grotesque form. Hanuman also spotted Ravana, his most beautiful wife Mandodari, and his other consorts. They too appeared to have drunk themselves to blissful slumber.</p>
		<p>The virtuous Hanuman felt misgivings and guilt for having infringed moral code of conduct. He thought to himself, ‘I should not have scrutinized these women ogres so closely’. No sooner did this thought take shape in his mind, Hanuman dismissed it with logical reasoning. ‘Well, I did not have any mal-intentions or undesirable motives. I did not entertain lustful thoughts in respect of these women. How else am I to look for mother Sita?’</p>
		<p>Hanuman despaired, for Sita was nowhere to be seen. His mind was plagued by an avalanche of unpleasant thoughts. He vocalized his fears to himself. ‘Could Sita have fallen down and met her end because Ravana lost his grip on her when he carried her across oceans and mountains to reach Lanka? Would she have died of grief, having been parted from Rama, and for having been touched by another man? Could she have been crushed to death under Ravana’s sturdy grasp as he abducted her? Perhaps, she wriggled free from Ravana’s clasp only to fall into the sea and be engulfed by its waters! Perhaps, Ravana and the ogres have devoured her alive! It is possible that the saintly Sita has cried herself to death at being separated from her beloved Rama! If mother Sita has indeed perished, how will I deliver the tragic tidings to Sugreeva my commander, and to Rama? I would be opening the floodgates of calamity by carrying such news. Yet, I cannot abstain from telling Rama the truth,’ Hanuman shuddered as he turned over these endless possibilities in his mind.</p>
		<p>‘All our efforts would be in vain if I return to Kishkinda without Mother Sita. The situation there would become chaotic once I convey this heartbreaking news to Rama. He will surely not survive the catastrophe. Would Lakshmana live after losing his dear Rama?’ Hanuman had become paranoid with ill-fated thoughts. He envisioned a chain of reactions in Ayodhya, and even among his own kinsmen. ‘Would Bharata and the queen mothers, Kausalya and Sumitra survive news of Rama’s and Lakshmana’s demise? What would happen to the kingdom of Ayodhya if the royal family perishes! Would Sugriva not be devastated by the fact that he had failed in his promise to Rama? He will certainly give up his life! Seeing our leader go, the vanaras will also give up their lives!’</p>
		<p>Hanuman was distraught. He decided that the best course of action for him, given the circumstances, was to remain in the forests and not return to Kishkinda. ‘If I stay back here, I would at least avert the deaths of Rama, Sugriva and all the others. For, they will continue to live in the hope that I will return with Sita’. Hanuman argued with himself. He even made up his mind to avenge Sita’s abduction and subsequent death, by killing Ravana.</p>
		<p>Hanuman soon realized that his thinking had become clouded by his obsessive preoccupation with these disdainful and foreboding thoughts. He cleared his head of this cobweb of negative feelings. ‘Had not Jatayu’s brother Sampati caught a glimpse of a lady who he believed must be Sita!’ Hanuman recalled. He pepped himself up with positive thoughts and began afresh, his search for Sita.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman discovers Sita in Ashoka Vana</h2>
		<p>No sooner did Hanuman gear up for renewed action that his roving eyes sighted the Ashoka Vana, an area he had hitherto missed exploring. ‘Well, this is the only place in Lanka where I have not looked for mother Sita!’ Hanuman instantly leaped from tree to tree to reach Ashoka Vana. From the impact of his powerful jumps, the flowers from the trees fell to the ground, carpeting it in motley colours. With his vigorous movements, Hanuman woke up the slumbering birds and other creatures that were enjoying their siesta.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/028.jpg" alt="Sita Ashoka Vana" />
		</figure>
		<p>Ashoka Vana was a scintillating garden set against a majestic backdrop. Streams sparkled and glistened like pearls as water from the mountain peaks cascaded in a steady fall. These rivulets of water followed a serpentine path and gathered together to form crystal clear ponds and pools where aquatic beings indulged in their unique acrobatics. Hanuman was bewitched by the beauty of his environs.</p>
		<p>Not far from the mountains, Hanuman beheld several lotus ponds abounding with flowers. He also noticed a distinct golden patch where trees stood on golden platforms, and a pond that was markedly different from other water bodies. Its steps were embedded with pearls and precious stones.</p>
		<p>There were plush palaces and huge villas overlooking the pond which was fringed by foliaceous trees. Deer and other animals frisked and frolicked in this flower and fruit laden sprawl. Amid this plethora of dense trees, Hanuman observed one tree that was different. It was the golden Simsapa or Ashoka tree. It was ornamented with climbers and creepers which wound themselves sinuously around it. Its rich green leaves sparkled in contrast to the array of flowers that blossomed in a riot of colours around it.</p>
		<p>Hanuman leaped over to the Simsupa tree and used it as a vantage point from where he could look for Sita. He surmised that Rama’s consort would certainly be drawn to this paradise on earth. His sincere efforts soon bore fruit. As he surveyed every corner of Ashoka Vana from his perch, he finally spotted Sita in a temple! She was attired in yellow-coloured soiled clothes, bereft of all adornments; yet, she was a picture of dignity. She looked frail, forlorn and fatigued from starvation. Ogres, who were ugly to varying degrees, surrounded her and bullied her. Ravana’s trail of loyal demons tormented her into accepting him as her lord. Tears streamed down Sita’s face in a niagara. It was evident that her sagging spirits see-sawed between hope and despair. Yet she remained determined not to give in to the evil and ignoble designs of Ravana.</p>
		<p>Hanuman experienced mixed emotions when he saw Sita. He was happy to have discovered her but was saddened by the circumstances in which he found her. This was not a place fit for such a divinely woman, and one of royal parentage. Sita sat in the midst of vile female ogres of Lanka, threatened and tortured by them upon the commands of their king. Even as Hanuman was summing up the predicament in which he found Sita, Ravana entered Ashoka Vana and approached her.</p>
		<p>Hanuman admired Sita’s display of virtuosity as she placed a blade of grass between herself and Ravana, and boldly countered his arguments and threats. Rama’s messenger was struck by her unwavering response to the demon king’s overtures. She unequivocally conveyed her allegiance to none other than Rama whose noble qualities were unparalleled by another living soul. ‘Oh! evil king, you are only paving the way for your doom and destruction, and that of your people, by this dishonourable deed that you have committed. You can be certain that Rama will soon come here to rescue me’.</p>
		<p>Ravana willed not to see reason. He delivered an ultimatum to Sita, ‘You will be doomed if you fail to decide your course of action within the next two months. You have no choice but to accept my gracious offer to you’. Sita trembled with fear as Ravana renewed his threat. Though she had spoken courageously to Ravana, Sita despaired and felt her hopes of being saved, dwindle. The demons who sat around her, added to her woes by painting scary pictures of the consequences she would face, should she refuse to concede to Ravana’s sinful designs.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman meets Sita</h2>
		<p>Hanuman’s mind worked feverishly. He debated within himself, ‘How am I to meet the divine lady and convey to her Rama’s message when she is in the presence of these wicked ogres? How do I approach Rama’s beloved? If I jump down from my perch and stand before her, I might frighten her. Seeing my form, she may not believe that I am Rama’s messenger. In what language do I speak to her – in Sanskrit, or in the human language which she is used to? She might mistake me to be Ravana in the guise of a monkey, for the demon can assume any form he desires!’ Hanuman turned these questions over in his mind.</p>
		<p>Though he was very much moved by Sita’s plight and wanted to console her and instill confidence in her that help would soon be at hand, he restrained himself from committing a rash act. He did not want to do anything that might jeopardize further, her safety. He exercised great caution in planning his course of action to meet Sita. He waited until nightfall and for the demons surrounding her, to fall asleep.</p>
		<p>After much deliberation, Hanuman hit upon an idea to communicate his intention to Sita. Sitting on the tree below which Sita sat, he started singing the story of Rama, from his birth to the present. Tears rolled down Sita’s face when she heard the tale of her beloved being narrated, so melodiously. As she looked around to see who was reciting it, she spotted Hanuman on the treetop. She recoiled at his sight and began to be plagued by doubts. Was it a dream in which she saw a monkey rendering the story of Rama! Or was it the fiendish Ravana who delivered this saga, disguised as a monkey!</p>
		<p>Hanuman sensed Sita’s dilemma. He hopped down from the tree and stood before her. He bowed before her with utmost reverence and explained to her that he was Rama’s messenger. He conveyed to her the pain and ache that Rama was experiencing on being separated from her. He gave her every proof to establish his own identity, and also recounted descriptions of Rama and Lakshmana to authenticate his status as their envoy. In final testimony to his identity, Hanuman handed over to Sita the signet ring that Rama had given him.</p>
		<p>Sita was overjoyed when she saw the ring; it was as if she was seeing Rama himself in person. She was convinced that Hanuman was indeed Rama’s emissary. She bombarded him with questions on Rama’s wellbeing and asked him why he had not yet come to save her from the clutches of Ravana.</p>
		<p>‘Mother, it is for you alone that Rama pines and grieves. You alone occupy my lord, Rama’s thoughts. It is your name that is ever on his lips and his eyes crave to see you. In sleep and wakefulness, is it only your name that he whispers,’ Hanuman expressed to Sita, Rama’s depressed state on being separated from her.</p>
		<p>It wrenched Sita’s heart to hear from Hanuman, the manner in which Rama agonized over being parted from her. Copious tears streamed down her face in a deluge. She conveyed to Hanuman that time was running out, and only two months were left for Rama to rescue her from the obnoxious Ravana.</p>
		<p>Rama’s envoy could not bear to see Sita in so much pain and grief. ‘Oh Mother, if you so wish, at this very instance, I can take you back with me to Rama. If you will only travel, sitting on my back, I will safely reach you to your beloved,’ said Hanuman.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was quick to observe that Sita doubted his ability to accomplish this in view of his small stature. He immediately allayed her fears. He assumed a gigantic form to convince her of his capacity to carry her across oceans and mountains and restore her to Rama. ‘I can carry this entire city of Lanka with its mountains and forests on my back, and still cross the mighty ocean,’ Hanuman told Sita.</p>
		<p>Sita who was convinced of Hanuman’s might, explained to him that it was Rama’s rightful duty to fight Ravana and take her back with him, from Lanka. She was candid as she spoke her mind to Hanuman, ‘It would not be appropriate for me to touch any man, other than Rama. So, Hanuman, while I am touched by your concern and warm gesture, I cannot perch myself on your back and travel to Kishkinda. It would be in the best interests of everyone that you return to Kishkinda and ask Rama to hasten here to save me’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was once again overwhelmed by Sita’s chastity, virtues and unblemished character. He appreciated her decision and readied himself to get back to Kishkinda. ‘But Mother, please do give me a token as proof that I have met you and conveyed Rama’s message to you. Rama would be delighted to see it. It would reduce, even if in small measure, his pain of being parted from you. It would put him at ease to know that you are alive here in Lanka, even if in distasteful environs,’ Hanuman said to Sita.</p>
		<p>While Sita gave Hanuman a piece of jewellery as proof of her having met Hanuman, she also narrated to him an incident that had occurred during their exile. ‘Hanuman, I will now recount an episode to you, of which only my lord Rama and I have knowledge. When you reach Kishkinda, you may relate this to him as additional proof of our meeting here in Lanka’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman accepted the token given by Sita and was ready to leave for Kishkinda. However, before departing from Lanka, he wanted to teach the demons a lesson for ruthlessly tormenting Sita. He displayed appropriate conduct and addressed Sita, respectfully, ‘Mother kindly allow me to punish these demons for torturing you. Allow me to box their ears, break their teeth, punch their nose, or hurt them in some way’.</p>
		<p>Sita calmly replied, ‘Oh noble son of Anjana, it is not befitting for us to get back at these hapless ogres who are only carrying out their king’s command. I am reaping the fruits of my past deeds. It is not in place for you, with noble disposition, to seek revenge and detract from the path of virtue’.</p>
		<p>Sita’s words pacified Hanuman as he realized the truth of what she said. He bowed to her with folded palms, went around her in clockwise direction and finally took leave of her. He assured her that he would soon return to Lanka with Rama to rescue her.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman on a rampage at Lanka</h2>
		<p>His heart was light, for he had discovered Sita. Hanuman whistled and hummed a melody in joy. ‘But my task here in Lanka is not yet complete,’ he said to himself as he began thinking like an ace leader and strategist. He argued within himself, ‘This is indeed a tricky situation we are placed in. Sita has to be rescued at any cost. How do we accomplish this mission successfully?’ Hanuman pondered. He weighed four options that one could consider while facing an enemy: negotiation, gifting, sowing seeds of dissent in the enemy camp, and direct combat in a show of skill and strength. He realized that the last option was the only workable strategy to rescue Sita. ‘Ravana is unrelenting and his men are loyal to him. So we will have to fight him to vanquish him. And to enter into a war with him, I need to assess the strength and weaknesses of Ravana’s mighty army, the weapons at its disposal and the extent to which his kingdom is fortified. I also need to survey the terrain of his land and get an idea of the climate prevailing here. I require knowledge of all these factors so that we can plan our strategy to defeat Ravana in battle,’ Hanuman thought.</p>
		<p>Hanuman began a fresh tour of Lanka to gather all the information he needed. He also wished to meet Ravana in person and gauge for himself, the demon’s mindset. In order to bring Ravana and his warriors out in the open, Hanuman planned to destroy the beautiful Ashoka Vana. He soon began a systematic destruction of trees and plants in the sprawling garden. In no time he laid waste Ashoka Vana’s lush verdure.</p>
		<p>When the ogres saw Hanuman on rampage and the damage he had caused, they rushed to convey this to Ravana. The demon king was furious when he heard of the devastation Hanuman had created in his most cherished garden. He commanded his valiant force to bring the audacious monkey before him.</p>
		<p>Hanuman grew to gargantuan proportions when he saw Ravana’s demons approach him. He swished his tail and with a roar that echoed throughout Lanka, he charged at the advancing ogres. In a booming voice he proclaimed, ‘Hail Rama! Victory to him whose might and strength are unparalleled. Victory to his brother Lakshmana and friend Sugreeva who are endowed with extraordinary power and prowess to vanquish anyone in battle! I am Hanuman, Rama’s humble servant, am here to greet Sita and destroy Lanka’.</p>
		<p>Ravana’s army was no match for Hanuman who overpowered and killed most of them. He then proceeded to demolish the sacred sanctuary of Lanka’s guardian deity on Mount Meru. A deafening sound reverberated through Lanka as he reduced it to rubble. The demons guarding the sanctuary too met their end at Hanuman’s hands. As he continued to run riot over the once beautiful city of Lanka, Hanuman kept declaring Rama’s greatness and how he would soon wipe out Lanka and its arrogant king.</p>
		<p>Hanuman continued, loud and clear: ‘Beware, Ravana, neither you nor Lanka will survive Rama’s onslaught. While you still have the opportunity, restore Sita to him and save yourself from his wrath’.</p>
		<p>Ravana who was firm in his resolve to possess Sita, mobilized more of his great warriors to fight Hanuman. The son of Anjana skillfully fended the motley weapons and effortlessly vanquished the demons. His indomitable strength was evident and none could stand up to him in battle. The demon king sent his youngest son Akshakumara, Aksha for short, to confront Hanuman. The young prince who was Lanka’s best car-warrior, looked resplendent, as he took position in his aerial chariot that was unassailable by celestials or demons.</p>
		<p>Ravana’s son radiated brilliance as he prepared to face the mighty monkey. Heaven and earth witnessed a battle between two well matched combatants, and Hanuman enjoyed the confrontation. Aksha rained arrows at Hanuman as he darted swiftly across the sky. As the arrows struck him, the gigantic vanara increased his size to still greater proportions and chased Aksha. The chase in flight continued relentlessly and the demon prince struck Hanuman on his breast with an arrow. Hanuman admired the young warrior’s heroism, sound understanding of the tactics of warfare, maturity, courage, and above all his composure while fighting. Hanuman was not inclined to kill the youngster. He debated within himself, ‘He is so young and looks me straight in the eyes, confident of overpowering me. But it would not be prudent for me to ignore the fiery ardor and determination that he displays to win this battle. I have no option but to kill him’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman, without further delay, acted upon his decision to kill Aksha. He first delivered forceful blows with his palms, to the eight horses of the youngster’s chariot. He then struck the chariot with such intense power, that it plummeted with a crash to the earth, and shattered to pieces. Aksha who was now deprived of his chariot, leaped up in the sky, bow and sword in hand. Hanuman made a quick move and caught his rival’s feet. He spun him violently and hurled him down, sending Aksha to his death.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Indrajit binds Hanuman with the Brahmastra</h2>
		<p>The loss of Aksha created fear in the minds of Ravana and his demonic forces. The king of Lanka immediately summoned Indrajit and instructed him, ‘My son, you have acquired powerful mystic missiles by propitiating Brahma. You have profound knowledge and excellent command over these weapons. Moreover, there is none to match your skills and you are safeguarded by your austere penance. Hanuman has killed my beloved Aksha and many of our army chiefs. Do not take him for granted or make any presumptions about his abilities. Observe and scrutinize his strong and weak points when you fight him. Go, subdue that mighty monkey!’</p>
		<p>Indrajit instantly prepared to carry out his father’s command after seeking his blessings. He hopped on to his chariot, ready to fight Hanuman. As Hanuman saw Indrajit coming towards him, he felt a rush of exhilaration. Once again, he grew to mammoth size to deal with the volley of arrows that Indrajit showered upon him. The indomitable Indrajit who was comparable to Indra in power and prowess, confronted the fiery spirited Hanuman. They matched measure for measure in combat: in skill, strength, swiftness and strategy.</p>
		<p>An avalanche of assorted weapons assailed Hanuman, but the son of Vayu remained unscathed. Much to Indrajit’s consternation, he deftly avoided them. When nothing seemed to work, Indrajit used the potent Brahmastra on Hanuman. The celestial weapon bound Hanuman by its power, and he fell down, motionless. Just as he fell, Hanuman recalled the words of Brahma as he bestowed a boon upon him. ‘Even the Brahmastra will not harm you except to render you immobile for a short while’. Hanuman remained unperturbed after being struck by Brahma’s missile. He knew he was invincible, for he was fully protected by boons that all the gods had granted him when he was a child.</p>
		<p>Indrajit rejoiced because he believed he had restrained Hanuman. With a dignity befitting a crown prince, he promptly ordered his subordinates to bring the troublesome monkey to Ravana’s court. In response to Indrajit’s command, the demons immediately chained Hanuman with ropes of bark and hemp. The act liberated Hanuman from the effects of the Brahmastra! He now regained the ability to move. However, he feigned immobility in order to once again survey the city of Lanka before returning to Kishkinda.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman meets Ravana</h2>
		<p>The ogres led Hanuman through the streets of Lanka as if in a victory procession. They jeered at him, thrashed and punched him along the way, much to the amusement of the Lankan citizens who had gathered to watch this parade. Hanuman ignored the treatment meted out to him. He absorbed through every pore the sights and sounds of a city that was so well planned. Its buildings revealed architectural and sculptural magnificence that Hanuman had hitherto seen nowhere.</p>
		<p>When he was dragged in to Ravana’s throne chamber, Hanuman was awestruck by its magnificence. He was equally fascinated by Ravana’s persona – his physique, bearing and splendor. He looked radiant like the sun with his massive frame bejeweled and decked in all adornments. Hanuman then spotted the tripundra, the three parallel white lines with a red dot, running across the centre of the demon king’s forehead. Hanuman thought to himself, ‘It is indeed ironical for this most ardent devotee of Shiva to abduct another man’s wife and bring dishonor upon himself! Ravana is endowed with charm, chivalry and auspicious marks on his body, and he is no doubt a person of great learning. But of what use are all these qualities, what purpose do they serve, when he has acted without prudence? By merely wishing to do so, he could reign supreme over all the three worlds! Yet, with his evil design and shameful deed, he sits here without regret or remorse for the unholy act!’</p>
		<p>Ravana fixed his gaze on Hanuman as he stood before him. Hanuman folded his hands and bowed to him in respectful greeting. The arrogant king of Lanka neither acknowledged nor reciprocated Hanuman’s salutation. He continued to glare at him from his opulently embellished throne. In response, Hanuman lengthened his tail, coiled it several circles to make a perch for himself that was a notch higher than Ravana’s seat! There was neither scorn nor haughtiness in Hanuman’s demeanor. He gracefully faced the demon king as an equal, and silently but unequivocally revealed to him and his courtiers, that his humility was not to be adjudged as meekness.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/029.jpg" alt="Hanuman Ravana" />
		</figure>
		<p>Ravana was plagued by doubts and his eyes turned red with anger when he perceived the monkey sitting calmly, unperturbed by his circumstances. ‘Who are you and why are you here? Why have you ruined my Ashoka Vana and killed my young son and so many of my soldiers?’ he hollered. There was no mistaking the contempt and menace in Ravana voice.</p>
		<p>While even Indra was afraid of Ravana, Hanuman was fearless. He looked him straight in the eye and told him the reason for his being in Lanka. He neither boasted about his courage, nor about his intelligence. In a casual, matter-of-fact tone he said, ‘I am Hanuman, the son of Vaayu Deva. I am the chief minister of Sugreeva, king of Kishkinda and the humble messenger of Rama, whose beloved wife you hold hostage. I come here in Rama’s service. I’m here to ask you to return Sita to him and seek his forgiveness. This would be in your best interests and that of your kingdom’.</p>
		<p>When Ravana did not budge from his stand, Hanuman continued to reason with him, ‘Are you not aware that there is no one, not even Brahma, Shiva, or Indra, who can stand up to Rama in battle? Rama is invincible. It does not befit a king of your stature, of such scholarly disposition, to covet another’s wife. Do you not realize that you are heading towards your own annihilation and doom? Oh! mighty monarch of Lanka, I am capable of defeating you in battle, all alone right now. But with due respects to Rama, I will not do so. For, it is Rama who has made a vow in the presence of Sugreeva and his army, to vanquish the enemy who laid hands on his dear Sita!’</p>
		<p>Ravana was unmoved. On the contrary, his anger was amplified. He ordered his guards to put Hanuman to death. As the guards hastened towards Hanuman to carry out their king’s command, Ravana’s younger brother Vibhishana intervened with his good offices. ‘Our scriptures do not allow us to kill a messenger. Punish him by all means, brother, but do not bring permanent disrepute to yourself by slaying a diplomat who is only carrying out the orders of his master’.</p>

		<p>Ravana heeded Vibhishana’s good counsel. He turned to Hanuman and said, ‘You take great pride in that long tail of yours. What better punishment can I give you than to set it on fire! You may go back to Rama without it and tell him that Lanka brooks no intrusion and Ravana shall not bow before him or anyone!’</p>
		<figure>

		<p>The king of Lanka then ordered his men to wrap Hanuman’s tail in oil-doused cloth and set it ablaze. The ogres were thrilled to carry out Ravana’s directive without delay and they set his tail on fire. Hanuman was in a murderous mood as he left Ravana’s court, dragging his burning tail behind him. He neither felt pain not heat from it as he leaped from building to building, and torched Lanka’s palatial buildings with gay abandon. He was bent on causing as much damage as he could to Ravana’s kingdom before he left for Kishkinda.</p>
		<p>‘Let the evil Ravana know what mayhem the might of a single vanara of Rama’s army can cause!’ he said to himself as he ran amok.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman rescues Shani Dev imprisoned by Ravana</h2>
		<p>As Hanuman continued his exploits hopping from roof to roof and setting Lanka on fire, he came upon Lord Shani who was held captive in a chamber in the palace basement.</p>
		<p>Ravana who had gained the boon of invincibility from Shiva and Brahma, wanted the same blessings for his son Indrajit also. Hence, just before Indrajit was to be born, Ravana abducted all the nine planets in the solar system and locked them up in different places so that they could not adversely impact the new-born. Ravana believed that this would ensure his son’s invincibility and immortality. Shani came to suffer this fate because he had been cursed by Brahma who informed him that an incarnation of Shiva would liberate him from it. Since Hanuman was aware that Shani was his guru Surya’s son, he set him free from Ravana’s imprisonment, and thereby from Brahma’s curse. Shani, as a mark of gratitude, promised Hanuman that he would never be adversely affected by Shani’s inauspicious tendencies.</p>
		<p>Hanuman, who always wished well for his fellow beings, requested immunity for them also, from Shani’s ill-effects. Shani promptly replied, ‘I give you my word. No one who worships you will be harmed by me’. Since then Hanuman and Shani shared a special bond with each other inspite of being diametrically opposite in nature - Hanuman was born of air, while Shani was born of fire.</p>
		<p>Though Shani had been set free by Hanuman, he was in deep physical pain because he had been tied with ropes and kept prisoner for a long duration. He requested Hanuman for some til (sesame seeds) and oil to apply on his aching limbs, to rid himself of the pain.</p>
		<p>Legend has it that the practice of offering black til and oil to Shani Bhagawan in temples has its origins in this incident. The tradition is endorsed even today because devotees believe that the offering would rid them of problems and pain caused due to Shani’s negative influence.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman rues his impulsive act</h2>
		<p>When Hanuman saw Lanka engulfed in flames and dense black smoke emerging from its various corners, he was suddenly jolted by fear. What, if Sita had perished in this blaze across Lanka that he had caused! As fear gripped him, Hanuman repented his rash and impulsive act. He cursed himself for having vented out his anger. ‘I have behaved in typical simian style. I have been fickle and impetuous in acting without forethought. How will I face Sugreeva and Rama after committing this reckless deed! Rama will not survive the news of Sita’s demise. None of Dasaratha’s family will continue to live after Rama is gone. I, who have been the reason for this calamity, have no right or even desire to live’. Hanuman agonized over the consequences of his hotheaded act, committed in a fit of fury.</p>
		<p>Just as Hanuman ruminated in this manner, he saw good omens before him. They lifted his spirits as he interpreted them to be an indication that Sita was safe. ‘How could Sita, the very embodiment of virtue and goodness, have been burnt by the fire I caused? Is she not fire herself? What harm can this external blaze cause her?’ Hanuman was convinced that Sita was alive and untouched by the spreading flames. Yet, before departing for Kishkinda, he wanted to ascertain that she was safe and unscathed by the fire.</p>
		<p>Hanuman leaped towards Ashoka Vana. Just as he had surmised, everything but the Simsapa tree under which the divine Mother sat, had been swallowed by the raging fire. Hanuman was immensely relieved upon seeing Sita, unharmed. He spoke to her and took her blessings one final time before taking off for Kishkinda. He reassured her that he would speedily return with Rama and his army to defeat Ravana and rescue her.</p>

		<p>Hanuman had accomplished his mission and he was satisfied with the havoc he had created in Lanka. He turned back one last time to take a look at the magnificent city he had left burning. Before leaping into the sky to return to Kishkinda, he dipped his flaming tail into the sea to extinguish the fire. In the process, a huge fish in the ocean swallowed a drop of perspiration that fell from Hanuman’s body. This resulted in the conception of Makara Dhwaja as the son of Hanuman. He was born of the mighty fish, as half monkey and half fish.</p>
		<p>The child Makara Dhwaja was exceptionally handsome in appearance. Ravana’s stepbrother Ahiravana who was also known as Mahiravana was the ruler of 1Paataala Loka, the nether world. When he saw Makara Dhwaja, he was so fascinated by his extraordinary looks that he abducted him and took him to his kingdom. When Makara grew up, Ahiravan who was impressed by his strength and virility, made him the chief guard of his territory.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman lands on Mount Mahendra to a thunderous welcome</h2>
		<p>The monkey of gigantic form, Hanuman, took a huge leap from the Arista Mountain on the coast of Lanka and was gloriously airborne. He looked majestic like a mountain with wings as he speedily cruised in space. He continued to navigate and kept visualizing in his mind, the scene at Kishkinda when he would deliver the news of having met Sita in Lanka. Before long, he landed on Mount Mahendra to a thunderous welcome from Jambavan, Angada and the rest of the vanara forces who had stayed back on the mountain, awaiting his return.</p>
		<p>As Hanuman recounted his arrival at Lanka, his subsequent discovery of Sita, his interactions with Ravana and the demon force, the vanaras bombarded him with a flurry of questions. They wanted to know how vast the kingdom of Lanka was, how Sita looked, how she was being treated by the demons of Lanka. The questions were endless. The vanaras were overwhelmed with relief and joy as Hanuman patiently answered their queries and continued to narrate the events that had occurred at Lanka. They danced and pranced in pure delight, shouting, screaming and indulging in all kind of acrobatics to express their happiness.</p>
		<p>Angada brought the vanaras to order and reminded them that they had to make haste to reach Kishkinda to give Rama the much-awaited tidings. However, the monkeys who were in jubilant spirits entered Madhuvanam, Sugreeva’s favourite fruit garden which they sighted en route. They decided to celebrate Hanuman’s victory and went on a rampage, swinging from tree to tree drinking honey to the point of becoming intoxicated. Once again, their leader brought them to their senses, and they continued towards Kishkinda without further delay.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman overwhelms Rama with news of Sita</h2>
		<p>When Sugreeva observed the ruckus created by the vanaras as they approached him, he rightly guessed that they had good tidings to share. Rama was overwhelmed when he heard of Hanuman’s successful mission in discovering Sita. The vanara hero recounted verbatim, his conversation with Sita, and related every occurrence that took place in Lanka. When Hanuman handed him the head ornament that Sita had given him in testimony to their meeting, copious tears streamed down Rama’s eyes. He pressed the jewelry to his bosom and asked Hanuman to repeat again and again, every word that Sita spoke to him. He repeatedly enquired after Sita’s wellbeing in Lanka, about how she looked, what she ate, and of how she tackled the ogres who tormented her ruthlessly.</p>
		<p>Rama was going through a whirlwind of contrasting emotions as he heard Hanuman’s account of his meeting with Sita. Above all, he was overcome with profound affections for Hanuman who had breathed life into him by bringing him news of his beloved. He commended him for accomplishing the daunting task and said, ‘Oh high-souled son of Anjana and Kesari, I am indeed happy beyond words at what you have achieved. None other than you could have accomplished this task. You have done Sugreeva and his army proud by this mighty feat. Hanuman, you are a hero without equal. Not only have you leaped across the gigantic ocean to discover Sita, but you have been an intelligent messenger and gone beyond the call of duty. You have acted in the most befitting manner and performed a task not assigned to you. This which would be of immense help to us in fighting Ravana in Lanka. Today I have nothing to offer you, except my heartfelt embrace’. Saying so, Rama enveloped Hanuman in a warm hug.</p>
		<p>Rama and the vanara leaders soon began to make plans to reach Lanka to fight Ravana and free Sita. Rama had Hanuman give him a detailed description of Lanka’s fortifications, approach to the city and the magnitude of its army. Rama then charted out the strategy to cross over to Lanka, but this involved constructing a bridge across the vast ocean.</p>
		<p>As Sugreeva mobilized his huge army in preparation for war against Ravana, the vanaras displayed boundless enthusiasm. The vanara sena began its long march and crossed several forests and mountains before it reached the shores of the ocean. Rama and the vanara troop pitched their camp there to begin constructing the bridge to Lanka.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vibhishana seeks Rama’s protection</h2>
		<p>Meanwhile in Lanka, Vibhishana brought to Ravana’s notice, the various portentous signs observed in the city. He fervently reasoned with his brother to restore Sita to Rama and seek his forgiveness. Ravana was unrelenting. Vibhishana’s noble nature rebelled against remaining on the side of the evil, immoral and wrong. He departed from Lanka to join Rama. However, Vibhishana stopped short of Rama’s camp to request him to provide him refuge. Sugreeva, Angada, Jambavan and other vanara chiefs doubted Vibhishana’s intent, and cautioned Rama from conceding to Vibhishana’s appeal.</p>
		<p>Once again Hanuman displayed wisdom when he spoke in favour of Rama accepting Vibhishana. ‘Eyes are the mirror of the heart. I do not see or sense any lie in his eyes, or in his voice. Moreover, Vibhishana is here, seeking protection from you’. Rama was happy with Hanuman’s observation. He acceded to Vibhishana’s request.</p>
		<p>Once Rama dispensed with the issue of Vibhishana, the vanaras embarked on building the bridge across the ocean. Nala, the expert son of Vishwakarma the divine architect, designed and executed the construction of the Sethu Bridge. Once the bridge was completed, Sugreeva and his vanara forces marched towards Lanka. Hanuman and Angada carried Rama and Lakshmana on their shoulders. When they reached the outskirts of Lanka, Rama made one final attempt to make Ravana see reason and restore Sita to him. He sent Angada with a message of peace to Ravana, which the demon king spurned.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The War between the Vanara Force and Demons Begin</h2>
		<p>To the beating of kettledrums, tabors and battle cries, the war between Rama and the Lankan kingdom began. The charged monkeys leapt into the air and created pell-mell amongst Ravana’s army, pulling down the demons stationed on the walls of Lanka’s citadels, mansions and palaces. The combat between the monkeys and the demons created a bloodbath in Lanka. Lives were lost on both sides. Duels were fought between Indrajit and Angada, Jambumali and Hanuman, Shatrugna and Vibhishana, Nikumbha with Nila, Praghasa with Sugreeva, Virupaksha with Lakshmana and Rama with Agniketu and several other demons. Motley weapons - spears, arrows, maces, javelins, lances and more, shattered chariots to pieces and killed monkeys, elephants, horses and demons.</p>
		<p>The battle of wits continued past sunset. Night turned more calamitous as weapons rained on both sides and caused casualties. Hanuman played a major role in it, killing many of the seasoned generals and warriors of Ravana’s army including Jambumali.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Garuda to the rescue of Rama and Lakshmana</h2>
		<p>As the battle continued, Indrajit rendered himself invisible and transfixed Rama and Lakshmana with serpentine arrows that lacerated their flesh in great measure. The mighty sons of Dasaratha lay motionless, covered in a pool of blood. The vanaras including Hanuman went into a deep state of shock and sorrow at the sight they witnessed. Indrajit who remained invisible and saw the events, lauded himself for having killed the two princes. In the same mood of jollity and mirth, he rushed to Ravana’s court to convey the tidings of his victory over Rama.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, as the vanaras gathered around Rama and Lakshmana and wondered on the course of action to take, a high intensity storm arose, accompanied by dense, dark clouds and lightning. The tempestuous wind whipped up mighty waves in the briny ocean and had the mountains tremble as if from a quake. Trees uprooted themselves and creatures resting therein plunged into the salty sea. The monkeys then beheld Garuda the eagle, swoop down on the battlefield. At that very instant, the serpents who bound Rama and Lakshmana in the form of deadly arrows, slinked away. Garuda then gently caressed the faces of the brothers. By the mere alchemy of Garuda’s touch, Dasaratha’s sons woke up, as if from blissful sleep, with no signs of injuries on them.</p>
		<p>There was jubilation among the vanaras when they saw Rama and Lakshmana healed of their wounds. Once again, the monkeys thirsted for battle. They reached the gates of Lanka sounding conches and beating drums, beckoning the enemy to fight.</p>
		<p>Jambumali, Dhumraksha, Akampana – some of Ravana’s foremost warriors, met their end at Hanuman’s hands. Upon the death of Akampana, Ravana sent yet another of his most able commanders, Prahasta, to fight the vanaras. But to no avail. Ravana’s commander fell in battle.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.024">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Ravana arrives on the battlefield</h2>
		<p>Following Prahasta’s death, Ravana himself decided to confront Rama’s army in battle. The ten-headed demon shone like the brilliant Sun. The aura around him was blinding and the vanaras found it difficult to gaze at him as he entered the arena. He massacred hundreds of vanaras. Hanuman became furious at the sight of his fallen fellow vanaras. He charged towards Ravana, saying, ‘Do you forget that a boon protects you from being killed by gods, asuras and gandharvas, but that you have no immunity against vanaras! A punch from my balled-up fist is enough to destroy you!’</p>
		<p>A fierce fight ensued between Hanuman and Ravana, each delivering hard knocks on the other. One such blow from Ravana rendered Hanuman unconscious; but just for a short time. When he regained consciousness, he made to lunge towards Ravana. However, when Hanuman noticed Ravana was engaged in combat against Neela, another vanara commander, he exercised propriety and stopped himself from intervening.</p>
		<p>Shortly thereafter, Lakshmana faced Ravana in battle and was rendered unconscious by one of his potent arrows. Hanuman was livid with fury when he noticed Lakshmana lie limp on the ground. He dashed forward towards Ravana and dealt him a thumping blow on his chest with his fist. The demon king reeled under its powerful impact. He fell with a thud, profusely bleeding in his eyes, ears and mouth.</p>
		<p>Lakshmana was immobile and appeared inert. Hanuman then carried him on his shoulders. In time, both Lakshmana and Ravana recovered and resumed fighting. Hanuman intervened at this juncture and pleaded with Rama to fight Ravana, ‘You must fight and subjugate the evil Ravana now. But while you are waging this battle from ground level, he is attacking you from his chariot. You too need a vantage point. Please perch yourself on my shoulders to fight him’.</p>
		<p>Rama agreed. As Rama and Ravana were locked in fierce combat, Hanuman’s swift and intelligent movements greatly augmented Rama’s war techniques against the demon. Ravana who was ruffled by Hanuman’s skilful manoeuvres, directed his wrath at the vanara. He attacked him viciously with a barrage of arrows. Hanuman was wounded and blood oozed from all over his body. Rama was seized with fury on seeing dear Hanuman hurt. He intensified his assault on Ravana. He smashed his chariot to bits, fatally injured its horses and driver, and struck the demon king on his chest. Ravana was exhausted after the grueling fight. Rama who sensed Ravana’s fatigued and helpless state, asked him to return to his palace, rest the night and return the following day to resume the battle.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman and the vanaras kill Ravana’s key warriors</h2>
		<p>Ravana returned to his palace in a disturbed mental state. He turned over the events of the day in his mind and was overcome by a sense of fear at the strength that Rama displayed. He gave instructions to his guards to secure all gates to Lanka, and then to awaken his brother Kumbhakarna who was in deep slumber.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Ravana summoned his other sons, Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka and Atikaya to join the fight. Trishira, Ravana’s three-headed son, first attacked Hanuman by hurling a spear at him. The vanara who was extremely powerful and sharp-witted, caught the weapon in the mid air and broke it even before it could reach him. The monkeys rejoiced at Hanuman’s feat. This infuriated Trishira swung a sword at Hanuman’s breast. Hanuman did not heed the gash caused by the sword; instead, he charged towards Trishira and struck him hard on his chest with his palm. Trishira fell to the ground, unconscious. The weapons he was wielding slipped from his hands. However, when Hanuman gave an ear-shattering roar, it grated on Trishira’s nerves. The demon sprung to life and dealt the monkey a blow with his fist. Hanuman, swiftly and skillfully brought down the sword simultaneously on Trishira’s three heads. The heads rolled down and the demon was annihilated.</p>
		<p>Devantaka, Narantaka and Atikaya met the same fate at the hands of other vanara commanders. While the monkeys delighted in the deaths of stalwarts from the enemy camp, the demons were petrified at the havoc Hanuman and his vanara force was creating.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Indrajit renders Rama and Lakshmana unconscious with the Brahmastra</h2>
		<p>Indrajit who was pained to see his father in distress upon the death of his sons and brothers, promised to avenge their loss. Indrajit was awe-inspiring as he entered the battlefield with key warriors positioned around his chariot. He worshipped fire with due respects according to traditional rites and made oblations to it in preparation for war. He then made himself invisible and fought alongside his demon force, destroying the monkeys in great numbers. Weapons of all sizes and shapes flew in the air as Indrajit wielded them ruthlessly with great aplomb, hidden from everyone’s view. He spared no one from the vanara camp - Gaja, Jambavan, Nila, Angada, Dvivida, Sugreeva – they all faced the wrath of his armaments. Indrajit created a veritable blood bath in the field as the vanaras lay wounded or dead, pierced by his lethal arrows.</p>
		<p>As the battle escalated, Indrajit sent a volley of arrows at Rama and Lakshmana who were rendered unconscious by the Brahmastra that he finally used. Indrajit believed them to be dead. He returned to the palace and rejoiced at his victory. The surviving vanaras despaired on seeing the battlefield ridden with fallen fellow beings. The mighty Hanuman who had fainted for a split second, woke up and was dismayed to find the sons of Dasharatha lying inert. Vibhishana, however, calmed him, for he divined that Rama and Lakshmana had come to no harm but were only honouring Brahma’s missile by remaining motionless.</p>
		<p>Hanuman who felt soothed by Vibhishana’s words, geared up for action and said, ‘If that be the case, let us bolster the confidence of those vanaras who are still breathing and alive. Let them not despair’. Hanuman and Vibhishana, with torches in their hands, surveyed their surrounds and scoured the battle arena, looking for those alive to infuse courage into them. To their dismay they found all the vanara leaders lying drenched in blood pools. The battleground was strewn with weapons and dead vanaras. Many of them had their limbs severed and heads dismembered. They then proceeded to look for Jambavan who they found lying fatigued from age, with arrows poking from various areas of his body. When Jambavan recognized Vibhishana’s voice, he called out to him.</p>
		<p>‘O Vibhishana, while I do hear you, I cannot see you for sharp arrows have pierced me and I am unable to get up. I wish to know if Hanuman is safe and alive’.</p>
		<p>Vibhishana was nonplussed to hear Jambavan show interest only in Hanuman’s welfare, to the exclusion of everyone else including Rama and Lakshmana. He asked Jambavan, ‘Revered Jambavantha, how come you do not enquire of Rama and Lakshmana or even Sugreeva or any of the other stalwarts belonging to our army. Why is it you ask only about Hanuman?’</p>
		<p>The wise Jambavan immediately replied, ‘O noble Vibhishana, if the courageous and mighty Hanuman is alive, every one of us will survive, whether injured or even if dead! But if he has given up his life we all are doomed and as good as dead! If Hanuman, who is as mighty as his father Vaayu and as skillful as Agni, is alive, we will all certainly survive’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman who was now standing near Vibhishana, heard Jambavan’s words. He bowed before the elder with respect and told him he was alive and that all was well with him. Jambavan felt he had obtained a new lease of life on hearing Hanuman’s voice and words. He addressed Hanuman, ‘Oh powerful son of Vaayu, you have a very important task to perform. You alone can bring to life our entire army and also Rama and Lakshmana who have fallen victims to the Brahmastra wielded by Indrajit. Make haste and go to Mount Rishaba in the Himalayas. You will find a blazing herbal mountain there which is rich in four vital life-saving herbs. Fetch them so that we may revive Rama, Lakshmana and the rest of the vanara sena. There is none other than you who can accomplish this tough task’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman, who was ever ready in the service of Rama, was overwhelmed and inspired by Jambavan’s confidence in his abilities. He bowed to Jambavan, took his blessings and prepared to launch himself into flight. He grew to gigantic proportions and stood radiant and handsome, towering on the summit of Trikuta Mountain, ready to leap into space. The earth shuddered as the huge vanara took off after paying due respects to the ocean which he crossed swiftly to reach the lofty, golden-hued herbal hill.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman procures herbs from the Himalayas to revive Rama and Lakshmana</h2>
		<p>Once he landed on the Himalayas, Hanuman began to scour the mighty mountain in search of the herbs Jambavan had mentioned. As he began his search for the herbs, they hid themselves from his view and became invisible. Hanuman was furious because he could not spot the correct herbs. In an anger-filled voice he challenged the mountain. ‘Oh! majestic mountain, you refuse to show compassion to Rama, is it? Just see, how I shall lift you off with little effort and take you with me to save my lord, Rama and his brother, the courageous Lakshmana’. Even as he said this, with a single swish of his hand Hanuman seized the herb-ridden hillock and bounced back into the air. He speedily made his way to Trikuta.</p>
		<p>Vibhishana and Jambavan were relieved to see Hanuman return with the herbs. The mere fragrance of the herbs that wafted across the breeze revived Rama, Lakshmana and the rest of the vanara force. The grievously injured, and dead, regained their normal robust state. They appeared as if they had woken up, refreshed after restful sleep.</p>

		<p>The revived, rejuvenated warriors of Rama’s camp were ready to resume fighting. The battle recommenced and raged fiercely. The monkeys torched large parts of Lanka. Ravana’s seasoned soldiers began to fall in hordes, one after the other, overwhelmed by the vanara army. The valiant ogres – Kampana, Prajangha, Yupaksa, Kumbha – met their end at the hands of the monkey chiefs.</p>
		<p>Kumbhakarna’s son, Nikumbha brandished his club which was festooned with wreaths and charged towards Hanuman. Hanuman valiantly bared his bosom and stood before Nikumbha, undaunted by his brilliant and classic manoeuvres. As the demon brought down the club heavily upon Hanuman’s bare chest, it shattered into a hundred splinters and fell to the ground. The vanara hero stood steady and strong. He balled up his fist and with the speed of lightning, darted towards Nikumbha. Power seemed to flow effortlessly through Hanuman as he struck the demon’s chest. Nikumbha reeled under its impact but bounced back to attack his opponent. The confrontation between the two of them was intense. Hanuman soon overpowered his combatant and knocked him down. He gave Nikumbha no chance to recover. Life ebbed out of the demon.</p>

		<p>While Hanuman put Nikumbha to death, Rama vanquished Makaraksha, son of Khara and nephew of Ravana.</p>

	<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-003.028">
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Indrajit is slayed</h2>
		<p>When Makaraksha, one of Ravana’s most experienced and artful warriors fell, the Lankan king’s wrath increased several folds. He summoned Indrajit and once again commanded him to head the battle. He extolled to his son his superior qualities as a warrior who was unconquerable, par excellence, and one who had in the past overpowered even Indra. ‘Remain visible or invisible, but kill the two sons of Dasharatha,’ Ravana ordered. ‘When you have overpowered the mighty Indra, these are mere mortals! Go, my son, fight Rama and Lakshmana. Return victorious after vanquishing them’.</p>
		<p>Indrajit who felt enthused and inspired by his father’s words, prepared for yet another combat with the sons of Dasharatha. Before the clash began, he offered oblations in fire and gratified the gods. He then ascended his magnificent chariot which was capable of disappearing from sight. A deadly fight ensued between the two sides. An assortment of missiles and weapons flew in the air, maiming and killing hundreds of thousands from both sides. Rama and Lakshmana countered the stream of arrows shot at them with mystic missiles, but their arrows failed to touch Indrajit who remained hidden.</p>
		<p>Indrajit took to trickery by creating an illusory Sita whom he placed on his chariot, and threatened to kill. Even Hanuman who saw the forlorn look on the face of the deceptive form of Sita, mistook her for the real and was distressed. Hanuman rushed towards Indrajit, who unsheathed his sword and pulled Sita by her hair. Hanuman’s eyes welled up with tears as he watched this sight with disgust and horror. He spoke angry words at Indrajit for his sinful act that reeked of disrepute and dishonour. ‘You are no less than a barbarian to behave in this fashion! Do you have no pity that you treat a lady like this? What harm has Mother Sita done that you wish to kill her? Do you think you will survive long after killing her?’</p>
		<p>Indrajit responded to Hanuman’s tirade by saying, ‘Oh monkey, you may now see for yourself how I put an end to Sita. Once I’ve killed her, I will slay Rama, Lakshmana, Vibhishana and the rest of you’. Even as he proclaimed this to Hanuman, Indrajit brought down the sword on Sita’s neck and she gave a horrifying scream of ‘Rama, Rama’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman froze as he saw Rama’s beloved Sita fall down dead. Indrajit boastfully said, ‘Go, monkey, go! Tell Rama that his Sita is dead!’ Indrajit roared and laughed monstrously while simultaneously mocking Hanuman.</p>
		<p>There was pell-mell in the vanara camp when they witnessed this gory scene. The vanaras dashed here and there in fear. Hanuman who recovered from the shock of the event, called the monkeys to order. ‘It does not befit brave soldiers like you to run away from battle. It is now that we should intensify our efforts to fight this evil demon and his lot’.</p>
		<p>Their anger now amplified, the monkeys heeded Hanuman’s call and attacked Indrajit with all their power. They pulled off mountains peaks and uprooted trees to fight him and the rest of the demon force. Hanuman himself went on a violent rampage. Hanuman, who was overpowered by intense anger, hauled a huge rock and hurled it at Indrajit’s chariot. The charioteer, who saw the boulder coming towards them, fended the blow well. The rock fell to the ground with a deafening thud. It created a huge chasm on the earth that swallowed the demon army in hundreds of thousands.</p>
		<p>As the vanara army advanced to wreck more damage, Hanuman asked them to return saying, ‘The very purpose for which we have been fighting this battle is defeated. For, this evil Indrajit has killed Mother Sita. Let us retreat and convey this tragic news to Rama and Sugreeva’.</p>
		<p>Rama was shattered and fell into a swoon when Hanuman conveyed the news of Sita’s cruel end at the hands of Indrajit. A pall of gloom descended on Rama and the troop of monkeys. However, very soon, Vibhishana who was aware of Indrajit’s magical powers, dispelled all doubts that Sita was killed.</p>
		<p>When Indrajit entered the battlefield to kill Rama, he had used his magical powers to fight and had made himself invisible. Now when he saw Hanuman retreat with the vanara force, thinking Sita to be dead, he once again used his illusory tricks to take an invisible form. He wished to speedily reach Nikumbhila Sanctuary and successfully conduct the Nikumbili yaga that would make him invincible in the war. Vibhishana who guessed his true intentions, alerted Rama to this danger. He urged Rama to allow Hanuman and Lakshmana to join him in the fight against Indrajit and thwart his plans.</p>
		<p>Rama who was convinced by Vibhishana, commanded Lakshmana to confront Indrajit in combat and finish him. Once again Lakshmana fought a titanic battle with Indrajit. Lakshmana, who was guided by Vibhishana, sent volleys of weapons all over the battlefield to bring Indrajit out of his invisible form, and hinder him from completing the Nikumbili yaga. Battle cries reverberated through Lanka as missiles and mystic weapons flew in all directions.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Hanuman was creating fear in the minds of the ogres whom he destroyed in great numbers, pelting them with rocks the size of mountains. Indrajit who witnessed the destruction caused by Hanuman, instructed his charioteer to ride right in front of this monkey of herculean strength. ‘We cannot ignore this gigantic monkey anymore. Go for him and kill him,’ said Indrajit. His eyes were bloodshot and his nostrils flared with anger that was now entirely directed at Hanuman.</p>
		<p>Indrajit hurled all kinds of weapons at Hanuman’s head. Hanuman remained unruffled. He spat angry words at Indrajit, ‘Oh evil one, if you are brave enough, fight me with your bare hands, not with weapons. You will not be able to withstand my strength even for a short while. If you do so, I will readily admit you are the best among the demons!’</p>
		<p>Vibhishana perceived that Indrajit’s ploy was to kill Hanuman, rattle the vanara force and overpower the enemy. He shouted out to Lakshmana, ‘Strike Lakshmana. Strike right away. Else, Indrajit will kill Hanuman!’</p>
		<p>Lakshmana was perched on Hanuman’s shoulders to fight the duel with Indrajit who fought him from his chariot. The fight between Lakshmana and Indrajit was a combat between equals. They were well matched in warfare. Both were endowed with indomitable strength, were peerless in valour and might, distinguished for their skills and exceedingly difficult to conquer. They fought like ones possessed. However, after an unduly prolonged confrontation, Indrajit finally succumbed to Lakshmana’s special missile that was presided over by Indra.</p>
		<p>There was much jubilation and celebration in the vanara camp with the fall of the mightiest of demons, Indrajit. Rama applauded Lakshmana for having accomplished this almost impossible task.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Panchamukha Hanuman defeats Ahiravana </h2>
		<p>Ravana experienced mixed emotions upon the death of Indrajit. He was gripped by depression, fear, anger and sorrow all at once. He sensed he was losing his battle against Rama. He sent for his brother Ahiravana, the king of 1Patala or the Underworld, a master magician and illusionist, to help him. Ahiravana promised help by assuring Ravana that he would take Rama and Lakshmana hostage and offer them as sacrifice to his clan deity, Goddess Kali.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/034.jpg" alt="Panchamukha Hanuman" />
		</figure>
		<p>Vibhishana who got wind of the plot, alerted Rama to the imminent threat from Ahiravana. Hanuman was put on guard and asked not to allow anyone entry into Rama’s room.</p>
		<p>‘Be very careful Hanuman, for my brother is an artful magician who will assume any form and try to trick you,’ Vibhishana cautioned Hanuman.</p>
		<p>Ahiravana came in various disguises, several times and tried to abduct Rama and Lakshmana. But the ever-vigilant Hanuman successfully thwarted his efforts. However, after many failed attempts, Ahiravana finally kidnapped Rama and Lakshmana while they were asleep, by entering their room disguised as Vibhishana.</p>
		<p>Once Hanuman realized he had been tricked, he vowed to kill Ahiravana and bring back Rama and Lakshmana alive from Patala. He immediately set out for Patala only to find the massive palace heavily guarded on all sides. He had to first contend with his own son Makaradhwaja who was the chief security guard of Patala. Though the young Makharadhwaja fought valiantly, he was no match for Hanuman. After defeating him, Hanuman strode into Ahiravana’s palace. Upon entering the palace, Hanuman learned that the only way he could kill the demon was by extinguishing simultaneously, five lamps. Each of these lamps was placed in the cardinal directions, and the fifth was placed upward at the centre.</p>
		<p>To accomplish what seemed an impossible task, Hanuman thought ingeniously and took a very rare form. He assumed five faces and came to be known as Panchamukha Hanuman. In addition to his own face, he took the faces of Narasimha, Garuda, Varaha and Hayagriva! While the face of Hayagriva faced upwards, the faces of Hanuman, Narasimha, Garuda and Varaha, faced East, North, West and South, respectively. Just as Ahiravana was about to sacrifice Rama and Lakshmana to goddess Kali, Hanuman with his resourcefulness, outwitted the demon. In the Panchamukha form, Hanuman successfully put out all the five lamps at once and with a single swish of the knife, he sent the demon to his death and rescued Rama and Lakshmana. The goddess who was impressed by Hanuman’s courage and wisdom, appointed him as her doorkeeper! Hence, even today, a number of temples dedicated to Kali, have a monkey guarding their doorways.</p>
		<p>Before leaving Patala Hanuman installed his son Makaradhwaja as its king.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman once again fetches herbs to revive Lakshmana</h2>
		<p>Ravana who was deeply anguished at the loss of Indrajit, now raged like a demented person following the death of Ahiravana at Hanuman’s hands. His anger blazed like the rays of a scorching sun, and this intense fury clouded his judgement. He decided to kill Sita to avenge Indrajit’s untimely demise. He swiftly drew his sword and proceeded towards the Ashoka Vana where Sita was held captive. A few of the ogres who desired his welfare tried to restrain Ravana who seemed beyond all reason. Finally, one of his ministers prevailed upon him and asked him to show his anger on the battlefield against Rama instead of acting with disrepute by slaying Sita.</p>
		<p>Ravana strategized for his confrontation with Rama. As the war commenced, there was a whirlwind of chaos and violence all around. A gamut of weapons - arrows, spikes, clubs and missiles - flew in all directions. Rocks, uprooted trees and mountains hurtled through the field as the battle was turning tumultuous. Blood oozed in streams from the torsos of fallen warriors and animals. In the midst of this frenzied combat, Rama was all over the field, fighting several demons at once.</p>
		<p>Missiles were exchanged between Rama and Ravana in a continuous flurry. Both stood their ground firmly. In the meantime, the glorious Lakshmana ripped apart the head of Ravana’s charioteer and Ravana’s bow. At the same time, he also saw Vibhishana being threatened by one of Ravana’s vile weapons. Lakshmana immediately rushed to Vibhishana’s rescue and in doing so, faced a volley of arrows discharged by Ravana. Ravana who was seething with anger, hurled a poisonous spear at Lakshmana. The spear pierced deep, Lakshmana’s chest and he fell to the ground, completely unconscious.</p>
		<p>Rama who initially despaired and became despondent on seeing his dear brother lie inert, bathed in a river of blood, summoned Hanuman. ‘Son of Anjana, you alone can save my dear brother. Without further delay, head to the herbal mountains and obtain the healing and life-restoring herbs to revive Lakshmana’.</p>

		<p>Hanuman bounded to the Himalayas to obtain the herb. Unfortunately, he could not identify the herb from among the cornucopia of plants that flourished in the mountains. Hanuman, who displayed great zeal to abide by his Lord’s command to save Lakshmana, repeated his earlier act. He uprooted the entire mountain and returned to Trikuta.</p>
		<p>However, as he was speeding over Ayodhya, the capital of the Kosala kingdom with the mountain on his shoulder, Bharata who was ruling the kingdom on behalf of Rama, spotted him. He mistook Hanuman to be a demon in disguise, aiming to destroy the city. He immediately shot an arrow at Hanuman who did not attempt to block it since it had Rama’s name etched on it. The arrow struck Hanuman on his leg. He then stopped to clear Bharata’s misunderstanding. Bharata who was repentant for being impulsive and wounding Hanuman, offered to help him by firing an arrow on which Hanuman could ride and reach Rama soon. Hanuman thanked Bharata for his kind gesture but declined the offer and sped on his way to Rama.</p>
		<p>When Hanuman landed on Trikuta with the hillock of herbs safely tucked under his arm, Sushena, the great healer monkey of the vanara sena praised him profusely. With his expert knowledge of the herbs, Sushena then set about reviving Lakshmana by pulling out the required herbs from the hillock brought by Hanuman. He crushed the herbs and infused the juice into Lakshmana’s nostrils. Lakshmana was restored to life and there was much joy and cheer in the vanara camp.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Battle resumes, Hanuman conveys news of Rama’s victory to Sita</h2>
		<p>Rama and Lakshmana then continued the battle against Ravana.They fought tirelessly. Indra sent down his chariot and charioteer, Matali, to help Rama. Rama and Ravana fired their most powerful weapons at one another as the battle raged fiercely. Each met the other’s attack with the perfect defense. Both of them appeared invincible. Finally, after piercing Ravana with hundreds of arrows to no avail, Rama used his most powerful weapon, the Brahmastra, upon the demon. Ravana gave an ear-shattering cry before he fell down dead; he was vanquished.</p>
		<p>After the war was over, Rama asked Hanuman to convey the news of their victory to Sita at Ashoka Vana. Sita was speechless with joy at what Hanuman told her. When she recovered from the pleasant shock, she addressed him, ‘What fitting reward can I give you O valiant son of Anjana, for bringing me such happy tidings! There is no gem, no jewel on this earth that would be worthy of the priceless news you have communicated to me’. ‘The words you have spoken with such affection are more precious than any heap of diamonds or any divine kingdom. I have been fortunate to witness Rama’s victory. What greater wealth could I ask for!’ Hanuman replied.</p>
		<p>Sita was overwhelmed at Hanuman’s humble words. She said, ‘Anjaneya, you alone can utter such pleasing words, so embellished with refinement, grace, finesse and intelligence. You are doubtlessly praiseworthy and supremely virtuous. You not only display great strength, valour, vigour and power, but also exemplary wisdom, knowledge of the scriptures, forbearance, stability, patience and above all, humility’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman bowed reverentially to Sita and waited to see if she had any orders for him. When none came, Hanuman folded his hands and spoke graciously to her, ‘Mother, if you will allow me, let me kill these female ogres who have tortured and tormented you and made you endure extreme misery all these months’.</p>
		<p>‘Anjaneya, these hapless maids have only carried out the commands of their king. Now that Ravana is dead, they will not trouble me. Moreover, I have reaped this misfortune as a result of my own past misdeeds. So why should I hold these demons responsible for my plight? Whatever has happened has been divinely ordained. Anjaneya, you are so righteous and honourable. It is befitting that you forgive them, even if they have sinned,’ Sita gently, but firmly told Hanuman.</p>
		<p>When Hanuman heard such kind words from Sita, he responded, ‘O divine Mother, you alone can be my lord Rama’s consort. Yes, you are indeed the personification of virtue! If I may please ask you, what message do I take from you to Rama?’</p>
		<p>Sita promptly replied, ‘Tell him I am eager to see him’.</p>
		<p>‘You will see your Sri Rama today, radiant and effulgent as ever,’ replied Hanuman, as he took leave of Sita.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman informs Bharata of Rama’s return to Ayodhya</h2>
		<p>The battle against Ravana was won. Rama made good his promise to Vibhishana and crowned him king of Lanka. His period of exile too ended and Rama was ready to return to Ayodhya. Vibhishana offered Rama the aerial car to ensure his timely and speedy return to Ayodhya.</p>
		<p>Bharata had ruled Kosala for fourteen years during Rama’s exile. Though he was confident of his brother’s nobility and integrity, he wished to know Bharata’s mind. He wanted to make certain that Bharata had no aspirations to continue his rule in Ayodhya. As they approached sage Bharadwaja’s hermitage, Rama decided to send Hanuman to Ayodhya to glean Bharata’s intent.</p>
		<p>‘Who else other than the intelligent Hanuman would be able to divine Bharata’s thinking by interacting with him? Hanuman is shrewd at reading people. He can understand and interpret their thinking without much effort, by engaging them in simple conversation,’ Rama thought to himself as he summoned Hanuman. He asked him to meet Bharata at Nandigrama and inform him of Rama’s imminent return to Ayodhya.</p>
		<p>Rama added, ‘If you sense that Bharata has even the slightest desire to be king and does not wish my return, come back and convey this to me. I will continue to stay here and allow him to rule Ayodhya’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman assumed a human form and departed to meet Bharata to ascertain his thinking. When Hanuman reached Nandigrama, he was shocked to see Bharata lead the life of an ascetic. He was dressed in clothes of bark with the skin of an antelope wound around his waist. His matted locks of hair looked coarse and coated with dust. He looked forlorn and emaciated. Hanuman saluted him with joined palms and delivered to him the news of Rama’s immediate return to Ayodhya. He said, ‘Rama, on whose account you have spent fourteen years in self-exile, asks after your welfare’. Hanuman also gave Bharata proof that he was an emissary from Rama, by showing him Rama’s ring which he had carried with him.</p>
		<p>Bharata greeted Hanuman with great respect. The sight of Rama’s ring was like the nectar of immortality to Bharata. There was newfound radiance to his entire being as he kept looking at the ring. To him, it was Rama himself in person. Bharata was overjoyed. He embraced Hanuman over and over, as tears streamed down his face in an avalanche. In a voice that was filled with exhilaration, he spoke to Hanuman, ‘What gifts can I bestow upon you? No matter what I give you, it will still be a speck of dust compared to the message you give me. You are no less than a divine being to me, for bringing me such happy tidings. I cannot wait to embrace my brother Rama and see him occupy the throne at Ayodhya. He alone is worthy to be the king’. Bharata’s ecstasy was indescribable.</p>
		<p>Hanuman too was overjoyed at meeting Bharata and admired his noble nature. He was spellbound by Bharata’s untainted affection for Rama. Bharata rose high in his esteem. At his behest, Hanuman, briefly described to him Rama’s travails in the forest.</p>

		<p>Upon returning to sage Bharadwaja’s hermitage, Hanuman described to Rama, his meeting with Bharata and repeated verbatim, his conversation with him. Rama’s mind was at peace. His dear brother, as he had known, was pure and noble with no aspirations for fame, fortune or to covet the kingdom.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman rejects Sita’s gift</h2>
		<p>Rama returned to Ayodhya and was crowned the king. His coronation was a grand event. On the occasion, Rama made generous gifts of land, cows, jewellery, gems, money and a host of other expensive objects to priests, scholars, guests and his esteemed friends Sugreeva, Angada, Vibhishana and others. He presented Sita a lustrous pearl necklace that had been given to him by Varuna the God of the Ocean. Sita who observed that Rama had not given anything to Hanuman, looked inquiringly at Rama. At the same time, she glanced lovingly towards Hanuman. Rama who clearly read Sita’s thoughts, responded by saying that she could present the pearl necklace to whomsoever she wished, to someone she deemed worthy of it.</p>
		<p>Sita, without losing a moment, placed the necklace around Hanuman’s neck. The son of Vaayu bowed to her with folded palms in all humility and reverence. Then in characteristic simian style, he scrutinized it, cracked the beads, smelt them, scratched them, and bit into them. Then to the utter surprise and horror of all those present, he flung the necklace, claiming it to be worthless.</p>
		<p>‘After all, what can one expect of a monkey,’ those gathered, murmured to each other.</p>
		<p>Sita who was stunned into silence at Hanuman’s strange behavior, finally spoke up. She asked Hanuman to explain his actions.</p>
		<p>Without batting an eyelid, Hanuman replied, ‘To me Rama Naama (Rama’s name) alone is worthy of respect. What need have I for these objects that neither have Rama’s name, nor his fragrance on them? Mother Sita, I feel honoured that you view me as worthy of this gift, but I beg your forgiveness for refusing it’.</p>
		<p>As the assembly of people stood speechless on hearing Hanuman’s words, Sita persisted. ‘Son, your body too, like all else, is made up of the five elements - earth, water, fire, air, and space. Where does it have Rama’s name in it?’</p>
		<p>In response to Sita’s querry, Hanuman asked Sugreeva to place his ears against his chest. Sugreeva was astounded and his eyes welled up with tears as he heard Hanuman’s chest throb with the continuous chants of ‘Rama Rama Rama’!</p>
		<p>To prove his point beyond doubt, and to reinforce what Sugreeva had already witnessed, Hanuman ripped open his chest to reveal Rama and Sita enshrined in it! Loud gasps followed the hushed silence in Rama’s court. Soon, the palace reverberated with the euphoric shouts of <em>Jai Sri Rama, Jai Hanuman</em> and <em>Jai Bajrangbali.</em></p>
		<p>Rama was overcome by a rush of emotions at what he saw. He came down from his throne and warmly embraced Hanuman. He then placed his hand on Hanuman’s wounded chest which miraculously healed at Rama’s blessed touch. The new king then addressed his zealous devotee, ‘Choose your own gift Hanuman. Tell me what is it that you desire to have’.</p>
		<p>In a firm and humble voice Hanuman spoke to Rama: ‘I covet your divine name alone, my Lord. I beseech you to bless me with everlasting love and devotion for you. May I ever entertain thoughts of you alone and may my lips chant your name alone. Let me be ever present, wherever your name is chanted and your glories recounted. Bestow on me life only so long as your story gets narrated and the world speaks of your deeds. This is all I ask of you, O Rama. These would be the greatest gifts I would ever desire and hold dear to me’.</p>
		<p>‘I bestow upon you what you ask, Hanuman’, Rama replied. He then placed his hand in blessing upon Hanuman’s bowed head and said, ‘My story will be narrated as long as the world exists and with it, your fame will endure and spread. For the invaluable service that you have rendered me, Lakshmana and Sita, I would be only too willing to give up my life here and now and discharge my debt to you. But I wish to remain indebted to you for eternity, dear Hanuman. I pray that I should not ever be placed in a predicament where I would have to repay this debt to you. For, it is only in times of trouble that one looks to have one’s debts repaid. May you never see such a time’.</p>
		<p>Eyes brimmed with tears as people beheld the warmth and affection that existed between Rama and Hanuman.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Why is Hanuman called Bajrang Bali?</h2>
		<p>Lord Hanuman is known by hundred and eight different names. ‘Bajrangbali’ is one of the most popular of them. There is an interesting tale associated with how he came to be so named.</p>
		<p>Rama Rajya was established in all its glory when Rama assumed the throne of Kosala. Hanuman had unwavering devotion towards Rama and always wanted to serve him. Rama and Sita looked upon him as a son. One day as he followed Sita into their personal chamber, Rama did not allow him enter. In all innocence Hanuman asked Rama why he was not allowed into the room whereas Sita was. Rama told him because Sita had sindoor, or vermilion on her forehead, she could enter the room. Hanuman was intrigued and thought that sporting the sindoor qualified one to enter Rama’s chamber. Anyway, he decided to find out more about it from Sita herself. The following day when he observed Sita in front of a mirror applying sindoor on her forehead, he asked her its significance and her reason for applying it.</p>
		<p>Sita who understood the reason for Hanuman asking her this question, smiled at him and replied, ‘I wear it so that your lord, Sri Rama will have a long and healthy life’.</p>
		<p>‘Oh, so this is the secret of the sindoor!’ said Hanuman to himself. Being Rama’s greatest devotee, is it difficult to guess what Hanuman immediately did? He obtained large quantities of sindoor and applied it all over his body. To make sure that his entire being was covered with the miraculous longevity-bestowing powder, Hanuman dropped huge quantities of sindoor on the ground and rolled over it. When he stood up, he was orange in colour!</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/038.jpg" alt="Sita Hanuman" />
		</figure>
		<p>‘If one speck of sindoor can lengthen Rama’s life and keep him in good health, now that I am doused in it, Rama would live for eternity!’ thought Hanuman to himself. Feeling happy with what he had done, he entered the palace in his new garb. There was a huge uproar and laughter erupted everywhere. Rama wondered at Hanuman’s antics and asked him, ‘Anjaneya, what is this that you have done to yourself?’</p>
		<p>Sita who understood it all, also laughed at Hanuman’s innocence. Sita recounted to Rama her conversation with Hanuman on the sindoor.</p>
		<p>Thus, Hanuman came to be known as <em>Bajrangbali. Bajrang</em> means ‘orange’, and <em>bal</em> means ‘strength’. Hanuman was always daring, courageous and strong, right from childhood. Though he had the strength and valour to single-handedly challenge and destroy Ravana, he had not done so only because of his absolute devotion and obedience to Rama. Further, ‘orange’ or ‘saffron’ is the colour associated with sages, seers and renunciates. Hanuman was a great sage with divine wisdom.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Snapping for the yawn or yawning for the snaps</h2>
		<p>Rama’s coronation was celebrated with much fanfare and gaiety. Kings, princes and other royalty from neighbouring kingdoms, and all guests had departed. Hanuman, however, stayed back in Ayodhya to be of service to his lord, Rama. In his enthusiasm to serve Rama, he waited on him and performed every chore so that he left no work for any of the others to do. Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrugna and Sita herself, who were desirous of serving Rama, felt they had nothing to do. After much thinking, they came up with the idea of drawing up a schedule of services that they would render Rama by turns. In the plan that they charted out, they divided up all the tasks among themselves, leaving nothing for Hanuman to do. They then presented the written schedule to Rama for his approval and seal so that it could be made official. Rama saw through the ploy, smiled to himself and placed his signature and seal on the sheet which was then pasted on the display board.</p>
		<p>The following day when Hanuman went to Rama’s chamber to perform the routine services, he was disallowed the entry, citing the new schedule as reason. When Hanuman dashed to look up the schedule and found no job assigned to him, he was downcast and in tears. But not one to accept defeat, Hanuman approached Lakshmana and asked him if he could perform some duty that was not allotted to anyone. Lakshmana readily agreed to Hanuman’s request since he was absolutely confident that he had not left out any service in his chart.</p>
		<p>After pondering for a while Hanuman said, ‘Fine, I will snap fingers and protect my lord, Sri Rama, from all evil effects whenever he yawns’.</p>
		<p>Lakshmana and Rama’s other siblings who did not realize the significance of the task Hanuman had decided to perform, acquiesced to his request.</p>
		<p>Since none can predict when one would yawn, Hanuman was always in the presence of Rama. He was ever ready with the fingers of the right hand to snap when Rama yawned, so much so that he even took his <em>prasadam</em> with his left hand. Sita and Rama’s siblings were puzzled at the turn of events. Rama gave a knowing smile. ‘After all, Hanuman’s wisdom and intelligence is beyond compare. Not all of them put together can match his ingenuity,’ he thought to himself.</p>
		<p>As night approached, Rama retired to his bed chamber. Hanuman was not allowed to follow Rama. Instead, Rama asked him also to rest the night. But Hanuman who took his task very earnestly, perched himself in the balcony facing Rama’s room. But sitting there, how would he know when Rama yawned. Hanuman therefore decided to continuously snap his fingers. He also began chanting Rama’s name to the rhythm of the snaps. At the same instant, Rama began to yawn incessantly and soon his mouth locked wide into a huge yawn and he turned pale from fatigue. His siblings and Sita were concerned and puzzled at this strange and sudden malady that seemed to have affected Rama. When Sage Vasishta who was informed of the happening came to see Rama, he noticed Hanuman’s absence and immediately comprehended the situation.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Hanuman sat smug in the balcony, snapping his fingers and repeating Rama’s name, oblivious to his environs and the occurrence in Rama’s chamber. He was summoned to Rama’s chamber at Vasishta’s behest. When he saw his lord’s exhausted state, Hanuman immediately stopped snapping his fingers. Miraculously, Rama’s mouth closed shut!</p>
		<p>Needless to say, Rama wholeheartedly accepted the service of his pure devotee. It was therefore Rama’s yawn for Hanuman’s snap, rather than Hanuman’s snap for his lord’s yawn! Sita and Rama’s brothers understood Hanuman’s supreme love for Rama and his determination to serve him in every little and large way possible. They decided not to interfere in his selfless service to Rama.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman – the Lord’s unsurpassable devotee</h2>
		<p>Narada, an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu, once claimed to Hanuman in jest that he was not a devotee of Lord Vishnu. This was Narada’s ploy to make Hanuman himself claim that he was a true devotee of the Lord. Hanuman who took the bait seriously, asked Narada the basis for his conclusion.</p>
		<p>Narada then explained to Hanuman, ‘According to Vedic scriptures there are six kinds of aggressors and one of them is an individual who sets fire to another’s house. It is no sin to slay such a violator. You, by setting fire to several buildings in Lanka, have committed this transgression. So, how can you, an offender, be a devotee of the Lord?</p>
		<p>Hanuman who understood the true import of Narada’s accusation, responded with a smile, ‘Esteemed sage, one of the important duties of one devoted to Rama, is to take charge of unclaimed dead bodies and perform final rites for them. This is to enable them to attain a better life in their subsequent birth. When I visited Lanka, I found not a soul chanting the Lord’s name. The same Vedas state that one who does not recite the name of the Lord, is considered to be a dead body! After all, did I not burn bodies that were already dead and release them from pitiable and vainglorious existence? I burnt them all, along with their dwellings. However, I spared Vibhishana’s palace. For, it was from his residence alone that I heard the divine chants of Rama’s name’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman further explained to Narada, ‘My roar in Lanka was so violent that it sent chills down the spines of all. The fetuses of pregnant women were aborted in their wombs when they heard my fierce roar. In this manner, I ensured that no more demons would be born in Lanka to perpetrate atrocities’.</p>
		<p>Narada appreciated Hanuman’s reply and heaped praises upon him as being the Lord’s unsurpassable devotee.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">When Rama issued death sentence to Hanuman</h2>
		<p>Narada secretly nurtured a tinge of jealousy against Hanuman because of the close bond he shared with Rama. He wanted to drive a wedge between them. One day soon after Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya, Narada asked Hanuman to welcome all the sages who had assembled at Rama’s court, except Vishwamitra. He informed Hanuman that royal protocol did not prescribe such a welcome to him as he was not a sage by birth and had once been a king.</p>
		<p>Hanuman did as advised by Narada and Vishwamitra did not seem to take offence. However, Narada instigated the sage by suggesting to him that Hanuman’s act was a deliberate attempt to insult him. Vishwamitra who was known for his fiery temper, immediately sought Rama and ordered him to punish Hanuman. ‘He should be punished with death by arrows for the gross misdemeanor that he has displayed towards me!’ Vishwamitra sternly told Rama. Rama who could not ignore his guru’s command, announced that Hanuman would be executed the following day in the open, struck by arrows.</p>

		<p>At the appointed hour the next day, arrows rained upon Hanuman, but to no effect. Hanuman remained unperturbed and kept chanting Rama’s name through the ordeal. However, since Rama had to keep his word to his Guru, he himself wielded the Brahmastra to mortally wound Hanuman. To everyone’s surprise and relief, the most powerful and potent weapon of Brahma failed to hurt Hanuman. Narada wholeheartedly acknowledged Hanuman’s profound love and reverence for Rama. He immediately confessed his mistake to Vishwamitra. The incident was brought to an amicable conclusion as Hanuman stood absolved of the charge.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">When Hanuman fought with Rama and became Veera Hanuman</h2>
		<p>Yayati the king of Kasi, had once inadvertently incurred the wrath of sage Vishwamitra. The sage desired to punish him with death and approached his pupil Rama for the purpose. Rama could not disobey his guru’s command though he knew Yayati to be a just and good king, and also enjoyed a good rapport with him.</p>
		<p>When Yayati learned of Rama’s intention to fight him, he was surprised and shocked. His wife, Queen Yashodhara and their children, Chandrangad and Chandramukhi who were also ardent devotees of Rama, could not believe that he would be a threat to them. As Yayati prepared to visit Rama and ask his forgiveness for any wrong he may have unintentionally done, Narada reached the king’s court. When Yayati narrated his predicament to Narada, the wise sage emphatically told him it would be futile to seek Rama’s help in this matter because Rama would never dishonour the promise he had given to his guru. ‘It is better that you seek Hanuman’s help through his mother Anjana Devi,’ Narada suggested to Yayati.</p>
		<p>The king, without losing time, proceeded to Anjana Devi’s ashram and requested her help.</p>
		<p>‘My life is in danger and I have come to you for help. It is in you that I seek refuge,’ Yayati cried, when he spotted Anjana Devi.</p>
		<p>Anjana Devi who was in deep meditation, opened her eyes on hearing Yayati’s cry of desperation. When she heard Yayati’s anguished voice, she responded even without enquiring about the cause of his distress, ‘I assure you protection on the strength and might of my son, Hanuman. You will come to no harm’.</p>
		<p>Yayati who just then saw Hanuman approach his mother, repeated his plea to him. Hanuman replied, ‘It is only right for me to honour my mother’s word. Since she has already promised you help, it is my duty to carry it out’.</p>
		<p>The king felt reassured upon hearing the words of Anjana Devi and her son. In a calm tone, he narrated to them the threat he was facing. When Anjana Devi heard that the danger Yayati faced was from Rama himself, she wondered if she had been too hasty in giving her word. She expressed her doubts to Yayati, ‘How can my son fight Rama on your behalf? I guess I’ve been impulsive in making the promise to you!’</p>
		<p>Hanuman comforted his mother who appeared distraught. ‘Mother, it does not befit you to go back on your pledge. Is it not our duty to protect whoever seeks safety in us? Even if it means fighting Rama, our dharma dictates that I should protect the king who has approached me for help’.</p>
		<p>Soon Ayodhya was agog with the news of the imminent fight between Rama and Hanuman. Meanwhile, Yashodhara came to Ayodhya with her two children to seek Sita’s intervention and help in the matter. Sita welcomed them and lovingly told Yashodhara that she should have no cause for worry because Hanuman would certainly save her husband.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, Rama prepared himself to battle Yayati and went in search of him. Hanuman approached Rama. He prostrated before him and with folded hands pleaded with Rama on Yayati’s behalf. ‘My Lord, Yayati is innocent and deserving of your mercy. Please do not kill him’.</p>
		<p>Rama was unyielding: ‘I have made a vow to my guru and it is only right that I keep my word’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was ready for a confrontation. He said, ‘Since I have touched your feet and obtained your blessings my Lord, I am now equipped with renewed strength and vigour’.</p>
		<p>‘Don’t flatter me and make small talk Hanuman. You can do or say nothing to make me retract from my objective. Turn Yayati over to me,’ Rama said firmly.</p>
		<p>Hanuman’s love for, and devotion to Rama was unparalleled. Yet, he was equally firm in his resolve to help the righteous. Without fear or hesitation, he replied to Rama, ‘I admire your loyalty and devotion towards your guru. But I’m afraid, in this situation, your guru’s command is unfair and unjust, for Yayati is innocent of the crime he’s been charged with. My mother has vowed to protect him and as her son, it is my duty to keep up her honour. You may first take my life if you must still kill Yayati. Till my last breath I shall protect him and not allow him to be killed’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman thus gave his ultimatum to Rama and then proceeded to assume a gargantuan size, ready to fight him.</p>
		<p>In the battle that ensued, Rama sent a volley of arrows at Hanuman who warded them off with his tail. Hanuman refused to fight with weapons. Instead, he continuously chanted Rama’s name. Every weapon that Rama used on Hanuman turned placid without causing as much as a scratch on his body.</p>
		<p>‘Hanuman, I am now going to use my special arrow, the <em>Rama baan</em>. It will pierce your heart. You still have time to turn Yayati over to me!’</p>
		<p>Just as Rama was about to release the <em>Rama baan</em>, Vishwamitra called out to him and said, ‘Stop this Rama. I admit that my false pride led me to seek revenge against Yayati who is truly innocent. Let him go free’.</p>
		<p>Rama replied, ‘But now that is not possible because I have already strung the arrow and it must be used’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman fearlessly stood before Rama, bared his chest and said, ‘Go ahead, my Lord. Rama naama is ever on my lips. Hence, I am not afraid to face this arrow. I will protect Yayati even at the cost of my life’.</p>
		<p>The arrow that Rama shot, pierced Hanuman’s chest, went deep and then disappeared. But Hanuman was standing tall and triumphant, unscathed. To everyone’s surprise, there was no wound, no blood, but the image of Rama stood luminous on Hanuman’s chest!</p>
		<p>Rama let go his bow and embraced Hanuman with affection. ‘Hanuman, you’ve overwhelmed me with your devotion. You have won this duel!</p>
		<p>Hanuman stood before Rama in all humility and said, ‘This fight has neither winner nor loser. Your arrow that pierced my chest has gone back to you, revealing your greatness’.</p>
		<p>Vishwamitra was stunned by Hanuman’s devotion and the love shared between him and Rama. He said, ‘Rama, Hanuman, you are both equally matched in protecting those seeking your refuge. Hanuman, you have displayed extraordinary strength and power in fighting Rama who cannot be conquered. You are not just Hanuman, but Veera Hanuman. Your name and fame will spread and remain so long as the world exists’.</p>
		<p>Vishwamitra took leave of Rama and Hanuman after once again expressing his regret for having created such a situation between them.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Chiranjeevi Hanuman’s promise as Rama avatar concludes</h2>
		<p>Rama’s sojourn on earth approached its end and he had to depart for Vaikunta, his eternal abode. Hanuman who protected Rama from the slightest of harm, refused Yama, the God of Death, to enter Rama’s palace and chamber by standing guard and ever remaining a vigilant. Rama tricked Hanuman by distracting him and diverting his attention. He feigned to have lost his ring which he deliberately dropped into a crevice that ran all the way to the nether land. Hanuman who went to fetch it for him, found to his dismay, a pile of rings in the region. At that instant he realized that Rama’s time on earth had come to an end!</p>
		<p>As Rama took leave of him and left for the heavenly abode, Hanuman promised him that he would continue to remain on earth for as long as Rama’s name was recited by its inhabitants. This was in keeping with the boon of immortality that Anjaneya had received in childhood – that he would be a <em>Chiranjeevi</em>, one who would live for eternity. After making this pledge to Rama and taking his blessings, Hanuman proceeded to Mount Gandhamadana, the tallest peak on Pamban Island, to meditate. Pamban Island lies in the Palk Strait between mainland India and Sri Lanka.</p>
		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman also created his version of Ramayana</h2>
		<p>In due course, Hanuman left Gandhamadana for the Himalayas to meditate upon Rama. Since he had mastered the scriptures, he etched with his nails, his version of Rama’s life story on rocks of the Himalayas. One day when Valmiki encountered Hanuman in his dwellings in the mountains, he noticed Hanuman’s narrative of Rama’s life on the rocks. He was dismayed when he realized that Hanuman’s account was far superior to his own. Hanuman who divined Valmiki’s predicament, renounced his version of the Ramayana, taking Valmiki by surprise. The sage who was wonderstruck at Hanuman’s gesture expressed his desire to be re-born to sing the glory of Hanuman.</p>

		<p>Hanuman was blessed with the boon of immortality. He lived in Dwapara Yuga during the time of the Mahabharata, and continues to live even today, in our times, the Kaliyuga. What form did Hanuman take and when did he appear in this great epic which involved Krishna and the Pandavas?</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman and Garuda</h2>
		<p>At the conclusion of Rama Avatara, Hanuman left for the Gandhamadana Hills and then to the Himalayas to meditate upon Rama. It was Tretha Yuga and Vishnu had incarnated as Krishna and was reigning supreme in Dwaraka. It was during this period that, an otherwise level-headed and modest Garuda, the king of birds and mount of Vishnu, suddenly became intoxicated by his own strength and power. He believed that nobody could surpass him in might. ‘Neither gods nor demons can match my power and potentials. After all, am I not the one, who single-handedly carries the supreme Lord Narayana who encompasses within himself the entire Universe?’ He boasted to himself.</p>

		<p>Pride and ego clouded Garuda’s thinking. He lost his focus and concentration while meditating upon the Lord. Krishna wanted to bring Garuda back to earth and rid him of his arrogance. He summoned Garuda and said, ‘O powerful Garuda, is there anyone who can equal you in strength and valour? I wish to speak to Hanuman who is meditating in a forest in the Gandhamadana Mountain. You alone fly there, and fetch him for me’.</p>
		<p>Garuda immediately left for the said mountain and was in Hanuman’s presence within a few seconds! There he beheld Hanuman in deep meditation. ‘O monkey, Krishna wishes to speak to you immediately. We need to respect him. Get up from your meditation and make haste to meet him,’ said Garuda, showing scant respect to Hanuman.</p>
		<p>Hanuman who was deep in meditation, was oblivious of his surroundings and did not hear Garuda. An insolent Garuda who was aware of Hanuman’s true state, put his beak inside Hanuman’s nostril. Hanuman who now noticed this act, chose to remain silent and continued to meditate. Garuda then shoved his beak into Hanuman’s ears and screamed Krishna’s message into them. Hanuman refused to be ruffled and was intent on completing his meditation. He began performing <em>pranaayaama</em>, the breathing exercise of Yoga.</p>
		<p>Garuda could bear this no more. He increased his size and began attacking Hanuman with his powerful wings. When Garuda attempted to grab Hanuman’s tail, the vanara’s anger was aroused. He immediately seized Garuda with his tail and covered him completely. When Garuda tried to counter attack and wriggle free from Hanuman’s grasp, Hanuman with a single move, swung the bird and flung him into Swethadweepa, the divine abode of Vishnu. Garuda’s wings, trunk and other limbs were damaged. However, since he had landed in the Divine region, with Vishnu’s holy touch, Garuda arose with his wings and limbs all intact. But the bird’s pride had taken a beating. He was ashamed of himself, for having detracted from his steady path of dharma. He went back to Dwaraka and stood before Krishna, head bowed down in shame. He fell at Krishna’s feet and asked his forgiveness.</p>
		<p>Krishna feigned ignorance of the incident. ‘What happened, Garuda? Why are you looking sad? Where is Hanuman? Did he refuse to come with you? Or is it that you did not see him?’</p>
		<p>Garuda then recounted to Krishna the events that occurred at Gandhamadana.</p>
		<p>Krishna reprimanded Garuda saying ‘You are simply giving a lame excuse for not bringing Hanuman to me’.</p>
		<p>Garuda who had by now understood why Krishna had sent him on this task, profusely apologized to him for his arrogance. ‘I understand that you set up Hanuman to break my pride. I cannot go back to him and bring him here. While I am willing to salute the direction in which Hanuman resides, I fear facing him. Give me any other work to do and I will happily do it,’ wailed Garuda.</p>
		<p>Krishna was insistent on Garuda bringing Hanuman to him. ‘Go, tell him that Rama and Sita wish to see him. He is sure to pay heed and come with you’.</p>
		<p>Garuda once again went back to Gandhamaadana. As soon as Garuda uttered the words ‘Rama and Sita’, without batting an eyelid, without completing his meditation, Hanuman sprung up from his place. He was ready to accompany Garuda. He also profusely thanked Garuda for uttering the names of Rama and Sita and offered him fruits and water. ‘Since I respect and revere Rama, I respect you who utters his name. Let us make haste and go to meet Rama. You may perch yourself on my shoulders and direct me to where my lord, Rama is’. Hanuman was overcome by exhilarating emotions and felt overjoyed at the prospect of meeting his lord after eons.</p>
		<p>Garuda’s fear of Hanuman had still not left him completely. He chose to walk ahead of Hanuman who followed him, chanting <em>Rama nama</em> all the way till he reached Dwaraka. Krishna who was as eager to see Hanuman, assumed the form of Rama. He also asked his consort Rukmini to assume Sita’s form to welcome Hanuman. Dwaraka now began to look like Ayodhya. Hanuman was delighted to behold his beloved Rama and Mother Sita. He prostrated before them and sang songs in Rama’s praise.</p>
		<p>As Hanuman was getting ready to leave, Rukmini as Sita, presented Hanuman a garland of pearls and asked Hanuman to wear it.</p>
		<p>Krishna in the garb of Rama, embraced him and said, ‘Hanuman, I love you more than I do my siblings and Sita. I am ever happy to see devotees like you. You may now get back to Gandhamadana Mountains and resume your meditation’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman was happy with Rama’s orders and returned to Gandhamadana. Garuda who understood that Rama and Krishna were one and the same, also understood Hanuman’s unwavering devotion to the Lord.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman and Bhima are Brothers</h2>
		<p>During their years of exiles, when Arjuna had once gone to the Himalayas to obtain Divine weapons from Indra, the Pandavas had halted at Badrikashrama in the Himalayan region. Draupadi was enamoured of the enchanting environs. As she was leisurely enjoying the serene vistas, she saw the Saugandhika blossom and was overcome by its sweet scent, which wafted through the air. Captivated by its celestial effulgence and beauty, she insisted that Bhima get the flower for her.</p>
		<p>Bhima who was happy to please her, set out to fetch the flower. When he had walked a significantly long distance in the forest, he heard a loud pounding noise. He followed the direction of the sound, and came upon a huge monkey, relaxing on a stone slab, vigorously swishing his tail against the hard ground. Bhima was astonished to see a monkey of such huge proportions block his way.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>When Bhima asked the monkey to move and allow him to go ahead, the monkey promptly responded, ‘The path ahead leads to heaven. It is a perilous route for mere mortals to take. I suggest you rest here, partake of fruits from the forest and return home’.</p>
		<p>Bhima was surprised to hear the monkey speak the language of humans. ‘Are you a demigod in disguise? You must be, for I know monkeys do not speak our tongue. I am Bhima, a kshatriya prince belonging to the Kuru dynasty. I am the son of Vaayu, the Wind God and second son of Kunti, the mother of the Pancha Pandavas’. Bhima further recounted briefly to the monkey that he was there in the forests of Badrikashramam with his mother, brothers and wife, awaiting Arjuna’s return from the Himalayas.</p>
		<p>In a very pleasing voice the monkey advised Bhima. ‘I am now ill and weak to move and give you way. In any case, as I said, the path ahead is strewn with danger and you’d rather not risk going ahead’.</p>
		<p>Bhima who had remained patient all the while, was extremely annoyed with the monkey’s unsolicited advice. ‘I do not need your advice. Will you now move and give me way, or should I move you?’ Bhima roared.</p>
		<p>‘If you insist on going ahead, I’m afraid you have to leap over my body because I’m too ill to move,’ replied the monkey nonchalantly.</p>
		<p>Bhima was becoming exasperated with this old mangy monkey. He argued with him. ‘You are obstructing my path. Just like Hanuman who easily leaped over the vast ocean to reach Lanka, I too can jump over you and bound across this mountain with very little effort to continue on my way ahead. But how can I jump over an elderly being and cause you disrespect?’</p>
		<p>The old monkey smirked and in a tone that revealed scorn, asked Bhima, ‘Who is this Hanuman about whom you speak in such affectionate tones?’</p>
		<p>Taken aback by the monkey’s ignorance, Bhima exclaimed, ‘How come being a monkey, you do not know about Hanuman, the greatest among monkeys who has performed magnificent feats! He is my brother, and another son of Vaayu. Though I may not be as mighty as Hanuman, I can certainly fight you if I need to have you out of my way!’</p>
		<p>The monkey smiled at Bhima’s words but stood his ground. ‘Well, I cannot fight you for I am ill. But since you are determined to walk ahead, simply move my tail and make way for yourself to go ahead.</p>
		<p>Bhima who was both annoyed and amused at the strange request made by the monkey, acquiesced. As he made to lift its tail, he could not even budge an inch of it, no matter how hard he tried. Bhima was panting and puffing from the effort and sweating profusely. He sensed that the creature was no ordinary monkey. In all humility he prostrated before the monkey and apologized for his show of disrespect and said, ‘You are no ordinary monkey. I stand defeated before you. Please tell me, who are you?’</p>
		<p>Hanuman then revealed to Bhima his true identity. ‘I am that very Hanuman, your brother, about whom you spoke a few minutes ago!’ Hanuman lovingly embraced Bhima. The brothers chatted with each other for a while before Hanuman directed Bhima to a safe spot from where he could obtain the Saugandhika flowers for Draupadi.</p>
		<p>As Hanuman took leave of Bhima, he bestowed a boon upon him. ‘I will reside on Arjuna’s victory flag and bellow loud and fierce, to strike terror in the minds of your enemies at war. As the enemy forces stand rooted to the ground upon hearing my horrifying sounds, strike them; it will be easy for you to vanquish them’.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman keeps his words and dwells on Arjuna’s flag</h2>
		<p>Arjuna, the third of the Pandava brothers, was an archer par excellence. His skills at producing wonders with the arrow were legendary. He was once plagued by a gnawing doubt. If Rama was indeed a distinguished archer, then why did he not build a bridge of arrows himself, to cross over to Lanka? Why did he take the help of a monkey brigade to construct one? His curiosity got the better of him and he wished to meet Hanuman to get the real answer to his question. Arjuna’s fervent prayers to meet Hanuman finally bore fruit when, during his travels, he spotted Hanuman sitting in quiet meditation.</p>
		<p>Arjuna approached him and asked him the question that had been bothering him. ‘If Rama was such a brilliant archer as claimed, why did he not build a bridge of arrows himself?’</p>
		<p>‘How can such a bridge take the weight of a huge army of monkeys?’ Hanuman questioned Arjuna in return.</p>
		<p>Arjuna who was boastful of his own skills, scoffed in return. He said, ‘That’s no big deal! I can build such a bridge right away if you want proof!’</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/043.jpg" alt="Arjuna and Hanuman" />
		</figure>
		<p>Thus challenged, Hanuman and Arjuna struck a deal. Hanuman said, ‘Go ahead and build it Arjuna. If I am able to walk on your bridge, you win and I will enter fire. But you will jump into the fire if you fail to accomplish this feat’.</p>
		<p>Arjuna replied, ‘But if I succeed in the challenge, Hanuman, I want that you ride with me on my chariot, to the battlefield at Kurukshetra’. Hanuman who was intrigued by Arjuna’s tall claims, and also by his strange request, responded: ‘Well, give me proof that you can build the bridge that would support my frame and I shall gladly accompany you on your chariot and help you fight the war!’</p>
		<p>Arjuna set about the task with great gusto and constructed the bridge in quick time. Meanwhile, Hanuman sat in a corner and meditated upon Rama and kept chanting his name. When Arjuna completed the task, he invited Hanuman to walk on the bridge. As soon as Hanuman placed only his tail on it, the structure collapsed to pieces.</p>
		<p>Arjuna’s vanity was pricked. He was crestfallen at what he saw. He cringed in shame and despair that all his skills and knowledge of archery had turned to naught. He was ready to jump into the fire in keeping with their bet. Despite Hanuman’s attempts to dissuade him from entering the fire, Arjuna proceeded to light one. Just then, a Brahmin who saw Arjuna ready to jump into the fire, wished to know what was happening. As Hanuman and Arjuna recounted their challenge to him, the Brahmin asked, ‘But who was a witness to your challenge?’</p>
		<p>‘No one,’ Hanuman and Arjuna replied in unison.</p>
		<p>‘Well, in that case, your wager is invalid. Will you repeat it? I will be your witness this time,’ the Brahmin offered.</p>
		<p>Both, Arjuna and Hanuman were certain that the result would be the same no matter how many times the challenge was repeated. Yet they agreed to the Brahmin’s request.</p>
		<p>Arjuna once again constructed the bridge, praying desperately to Krishna to help him. When the bridge was completed, Hanuman once again lashed his tail on it. He was fully confident that he would bring it down, crashing. But to his utter disbelief, nothing happened. Hanuman then placed one foot on the bridge. Still nothing happened! Hanuman then strode on the arrow bridge with firm, hard steps. The bridge stood firm as rock. Hanuman was puzzled and angry. He began to pace the bridge with all his might, with thumping steps. But the bridge remained sturdy as ever!</p>
		<p>Hanuman willingly accepted defeat. But he felt something was not right about this entire challenge, the second time around. With folded hands, he enquired after the Brahmin, his true identity. To his surprise, Krishna revealed himself to Hanuman and Arjuna.</p>
		<p>Krishna explained, ‘Arjuna, when you first built the bridge, you were arrogant about your knowledge and skill. Whereas Hanuman only thought of Rama all the while and Rama will not let his true devotee down. So, Hanuman won the wager. The second time you had learnt your lesson in humility and sought refuge in me, uttering my name for every arrow you used. I did not fail you. But this time around, Hanuman was certain he would bring the bridge down! So, neither of you failed the challenge’.</p>
		<p>Hanuman regretted making Arjuna feel inept. As agreed upon, he bolstered Arjuna’s chariot during the Kurukshetra War by appearing in the form of an emblem on his flag and thus assisted him in the war.</p>

		<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hanuman, the Eternal!</h2>
		<p>Sages and seers believe that Hanuman still resides on the Gandhamadana peak, which is located close to Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu, and protects people from evil. Legend has it that sage Madhvacharya, a philosopher who lived between the 13th and 14th centuries was graced by Hanuman’s visit. Yet again, it is believed that Saint Goswami Tulsidas who lived between the 15th and 16th centuries, was urged by Hanuman to write Tulasi Ramayan, more popularly known as Ramcharitmanas. The 17th century Madhva saint and philosopher Sri Raghavendra Swamiji is believed to have had the darshan of Anjaneya in the form of Panchamukhi Hanuman.</p>
