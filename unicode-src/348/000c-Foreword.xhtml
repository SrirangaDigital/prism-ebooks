	<p><em><strong>“Imagination beyond Imagination!” that is this debut - novel’s author - the little girl! Harshitha!</strong></em></p>
	<p>The narration darts off with a normal vigourous note of a usual middle-school atmosphere : proceeds in a normal pace for some time; and then glides into a venturesome involvement of the friends; then they get to witness the esoteric character, their apporpriate nomenclatures (through out, with the personification by the author) and their suitable behaviourism; drifts the reader along with the characters to the imaginary planer and lands the reader into the realm of clans - to partake and experience the thrill of their exciting explorations. The little girl novelist’s inventure imaginations, and their meticulous presentation - denotes - a bright progressive literary domain of acturalization - in her future.</p>
<p>This is demarked as the 1st volume and any reader would eagerly and expectently look forward for the release of Volume 2 and 3 !! and more !</p>
<p>God’s blessings are already favoured on her through her future !</p>
