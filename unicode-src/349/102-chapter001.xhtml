		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 1</span>Listen to your body : Undiagnosed fever till it recedes, but a new symptom erupts</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">H</span>aving settled down in Dharwad after completing my innings as a professional engineer in industry for the past 25 years, I thought we could relocate for a short period. Accordingly, I moved out along with wife Nalu (Nick name of Nalini) in early 2008, to a new work life and location in Bangalore, and to be with our daughter Arati and her family.</p>
		<p>Come June 2008, I began getting low fever every day evening lasting about two hours from 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm. However, upon sweating profusely, the fever used to recede. On consulting Dr. Ramesh of Apollo Hospital, who, after carrying out a few blood tests, thought it might be due to stress and pollution. </p>
		<p>But his medication did not have any effect, and the fever kept on coming every day evening at a near fixed or scheduled time. This got Dr. Ramesh in a Catch 22 situation. Accordingly, he advised blood culture examination and tests, which made me a regular visitor to Religare Pathological Lab, next to our house at Vignan Nagar. After a few more tests, Dr. Ramesh told me I had urinary infection, and advised me to consult a urologist. </p>
		<p>I decided to see Dr. Dubey, a Urologist at Manipal Hospital. Dr. Dubey did my uroflow test, but did not find any evidence of urinary infection. He, however, advised sonography test of my bladder. The scan indicated growth of prostate, but said there was no infection, since the PSA level was within reference range. Hence, I was advised to consult a Physician. </p>
		<p>This left me rather confused. When I went back to Dr. Ramesh at the Apollo Hospital, he refused to do my further check up, saying that he had done 100 % testing, but to my surprise, he suggested that I undergo surgery for prostate enlargement, which even Dr. Dubey, the Urologist had neither suggested nor advised. I did not understand why he said so, but I remained silent. Just did not know what to do next, and where I should get my health condition finally checked and diagnosed. Meanwhile, the scheduled fever came regularly every day. </p>
		<p><strong>Something is not alright </strong></p>
		<p>After a gap of some days, I decided to approach the Manipal Hospital again for tests by a General Physician. There I was advised to take a digital X ray of my chest to rule out the possibility of TB or Pneumonia, though I did not have even the minute symptoms of either of these diseases. The X Ray I took on the advice of Manipal Hospital doctors did not indicate anything, much less TB or Pneumonia. Thus, the diagnosis was becoming curiouser and curiouser, leading to nowhere. </p>
		<p>In the meantime, my father, who had completed his 100th birthday, and was living with us in Bangalore since August 2008 passed away due to advanced age, and deterioration in his health. As per our customs, I had to perform the obsequies for 13 days, which I did despite my continuing stubborn fever. It was only after completing all the rituals related to my father’s death, I reverted to reviewing my health condition, which by then had become fever chronic.</p>
		<p>For want of diagnosis by General Physician and Urologist, I was feeling like a football being kicked around. I was moving from pillar to post without knowing what was the actual diagnosis arising from my fevers. </p>
		<p>Eventually, I again approached Manipal Hospital for a total body check up. They did PSA, complete blood tests, and nuclear scan of my whole body, but again the result said everything is OK, as usual. My body was not at all ready to tell the reason for the everyday fever that I was getting.</p>
		<p>As a last resort, I approached Dr. Maiyya, a reputed senior Doctor at his Jayanagar Hospital in the hope that he may arrive at a definite diagnosis. I went to his Hospital where all the tests including blood tests and sonography scanning were carried out once again. The Sr Urologist there certified in writing that there was nothing wrong with my urinary system, but did not tell the cause of my regular daily fevers.</p>
		<p>Dr. Maiyya opined that though the reports were clear, a trace of minor infection was found in the urine, and the continued fever could probably be due to an unattended urinary infection. I was thus back to square one. All this had left in my mind the difficulty and uncertainty in knowing what this incessant and regular fever meant. Nonetheless, I said nothing and remained calm, as before. I was ready and confident that I would fight whatever my fever or health condition is ultimately diagnosed as.</p>
		<p>I returned to our home at Vignan Nagar without any explanation about my health issue and any definite diagnosis. And without knowing what may be the cause of my fevers, I told my better half Nalu that let us go back to Dharwad. I started blaming Bangalore for its pollution, and told daughter Arati and son-in-law Vijay that since Bangalore climate didn’t suit me, I would prefer to go back to Dharwad, and try my luck there. As decided, we finally moved to Dharwad. We felt happy and relieved to be back in our sweet home ‘Aashraya’. </p>
		<p>After a week or so, I decided to meet our good old friend Dr.&#160;Nadkarni, who was our family doctor for the past fifteen years. He&#160;had attended to, and treated my parents, as also our children, and knew our body well. He read all my reports, and heard my detailed fever story. Then he advised that I better see our good friend Dr. Raviraj Raikar, a Urologist at Hubli.</p>
		<p><strong>Body gets alright on its own </strong></p>
		<p>By prior appointment, I went to meet Urologist Dr. Raikar the following week, and gave a detailed report of my health status, and all the tests carried out. He read all the medications I was taking, and he saw the remaining tablets I had carried with me. He was literally shocked to see the bundle of tablets I was swallowing daily, not knowing for what they were. Putting aside all the tablets, Dr. Raikar asked me to forthwith stop all the medications, and told me that he was giving me some fresh medicines instead, which would just cost Rs. 5/- for 5 tablets, and instructed me to take them one each for the next 5 days. He further told me if I felt OK, I need not revert to him, and in case I did not get any relief, I could call him up, and seek his advice. Miraculously, and with God’s grace, those five tablets did the trick, and with the disappearance of fever, and possibly urinary problem, my health returned to normal.</p>
		<p>After we came back to Dharwad, and upon feeling good and fit, with whatever treatment I had from our family doctor, I was settling down with my work of US firm business, and interacting daily with our staff. </p>
		<p>Being away from Dharwad for nearly two years, our house ‘Aashraya’ was in disrepairs, and not in good condition, particularly after the tenant had left it some months ago. So, we had to refurbish and renovate our house. We were seized of this work, and the house was soon getting a good facelift in tandem with my health. Days were passing by without any problems, and I was feeling alright as before with my work load. </p>
		<p>Wanting a break or change from the huge work of reconditioning and renovating our house, which took us a little over 3 months’ time, my wife Nalu and I decided to go for a couple of days to Bangalore, and spend holidays with our grandchildren. It was Diwali season, and we celebrated the festival in Bangalore with gaiety, sweets and fireworks. </p>
		<p>We had planned to return to Dharwad thereafter. We were preparing to leave Bangalore on the evening of the 6th day. In the morning that day, while shaving, I noticed a small gram sized hard spot on my left cheek. The razor was stalling at one point. I thought of sharing this matter with Nalu. </p>
		<p>At this point of time, I recalled when I was about 29 years, working in a small factory at Dharwad years ago, I had a small lump on my left thigh, and I was feeling uneasy. I had then approached Dr. Kamalapur Sr., our factory doctor, who saw and felt the site of lump growth on my left thigh. The lump size was about 25 mm. He even moved the lump sideways, and understand its condition. Then, he told me not to get unduly worried, as it was a regular lipoma fat cell accumulation, usually occurring in males. </p>
		<p>That reminded me of a similar lump on my father’s thigh, and I thought it may be genetic. Till the age of 64 years I had some of these types of lumps all over my body, but there was no cause for any concern. Having had so many lipoma fat cell points over my body in the past, there should not have been any worry, but my mind was telling me to share this matter with Nalu, without waiting further. It was all the while lurking in my mind, but I kept my fingers crossed till we reach Dharwad.</p>
		<p>The very next day after we reached Dharwad, and after my daily shave, I walked to the kitchen, and said to Nalu that there is some small hard spot on my left cheek, and it’s bothering me for the past three days while shaving, She touched the hard small gram size spot, and laughingly said : “Oh ! all over your body you have bigger lumps of such kind, but you are bothered about this small one, and said you unnecessarily get worried over such small matters; this is normal like other lumps on your body; take it easy, and get ready for breakfast”.</p>
		<p>Over the next two weeks, though something within me was telling me to get it checked. After waiting for another week, I approached Dr. Nadkarni again one fine morning, and told him about the hard spot on my left cheek. At the end of his initial examination, he said for definite that this was another lipoma fat cell lump, similar to the ones on my body. Further, he asked me not to worry, but told that if the lump grew in size in three months, I should check with him.</p>
		<p>Three months passed by, but there was no appreciable growth of the gram size lump, much less any pain. However, when I checked with Dr. Nadkarni and reported him of no growth, he gleefully said, “See that is what I told you, but you are getting unduly perturbed. When you already have so many supari size lumps on your body, why should you get disturbed by this small one. If it were to grow slightly bigger, you may grow beard to cover it up, if you are so concerned about your looks”. </p>
		<p><strong>Suspected growth on cheek turns out benign</strong></p>
		<p>But the monkey was not ready to get off my back. I was often thinking about this small lump. Another two months passed, though there was no issue of the Lumpy Gram, but my mind was not at peace. So, I went to Dr. Nadkarni again, and requested him to refer me to a good surgeon. He agreed reluctantly, and mentioned to me about Dr. Kaulgud, the highly regarded surgeon in Dharwad town, and spoke to him on phone in my presence, explaining the growth of a gram sized lump, which was known as lipoma fat cell that I had developed, and requested him to do whatever is possible to have my doubts removed.</p>
		<p>Next day morning I visited ‘Lady of Lourdes Hospital’, which is popularly known as “German Hospital” at Dharwad, to see and consult Dr. Kaulgud for diagnosis of my gram sized lump on my cheek. Dr. Kaulgud examined it, and said that the growth was the lipoma fat cell, and nothing more.</p>
		<p>After a fortnight or so, not being fully satisfied, I went to Dr.&#160;Kaulgud again, and requested that a biopsy be done. I had sought it on my own, and without asking or consulting anybody. It was something that my mind was prompting me to go through this procedure, and clear my doubts. </p>
		<p>Dr. Kaulgud, though initially reluctant, agreed to carry out the biopsy procedure the very next day. I informed about this to Nalu, and told her that I will drive to the Hospital, and be back home after the procedure.</p>
		<p>But my office colleagues did not want me to go alone, and accompanied me to the Hospital in the morning. Dr. Kaulgud did the biopsy by giving local anaesthesia, and once it was over, I walked out like a normal person. </p>
		<p>Next day was very crucial, as the biopsy report was expected from the Lab. We all reached the Hospital, and Dr. Kaulgud called us in to show the report, and read it aloud that the mass taken out from my cheek for biopsy was benign, and advised me not to worry. We were all happy and relieved as everything was alright, and my mind was free from the doubts and anxiety of past nine months. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 2</span>At last, the visible signs in the onset of cancer </h1>
		<p>I was readying to go over to Bagalkot with my family for the Shastabdi function of my brother-in-law. Still there were some days left, and the growth of my small lump started showing. The gram sized lump, that is how I used to call it, was growing in size. And within a few days, it started looking like a mango slice. I was looking somewhat embarrassed and worried, but most people kept on saying that since it is benign, I should not bother at all about its size. </p>
		<p>Going by the common perception and traditional belief, ‘any growth in the body if tampered with, gets hurt’. And starts re-growing with vengeance ! It is precisely that was happening in my case. In medical terms, it is said that the “mass within the lump mutates, and grows”. I find this picture and possible scenario somewhat baffling. </p>
		<p>I went with Nalu to Bagalkot, and reached the Hotel, which was reserved for us. I called daughter Arati, who had also come there, to have a look at the Biopsy Report, which said the lump growth was benign, though it had grown quickly after the surgery. Looking at the report and my growth on the cheek, she also opined that this might be like other lipoma fat cells all over my body. She said “Don’t worry, daddy”, it is just benign. </p>
		<p>Everyone was enjoying each other’s company at the function amidst different poojas, celebrations and delicious foods. I was sitting alone at the end of the line on the lunch table eating some dishes and food items, but my mind was restless due to the enlarged lump on my cheek. Most of the family members, relatives and known persons were wondering at my inexplicable silence, as I was not in my usual elements : talking, chatting and interacting. At last, the function in the day got over, which was followed by entertainment to all. </p>
		<p>Next day, we returned to Dharwad. It was just routine and usual in all aspects the whole of the week. Thereafter, the days passed off without any incidence or fuss. A week after that I started getting pain in my ear with a ringing sound. Maybe, it was due to the aging process, I thought. As for the lumpy growth of mango slice size, I had reconciled to living with it, except having to tell about it to known people and new faces. </p>
		<p>At last, I decided to consult ENT Specialist Dr. Uday Kumar Grampurohit, whose Clinic was located at the busy mid market in Dharwad town. On the day he examined me, he said that there was some wax accumulated in my right ear, which he removed and cleaned. Then, he prescribed a few medicines. Thereafter, he did audiogram of both the ears, and stated that except for some minor issue with my right ear, everything was okay. </p>
		<p>While we were chatting about my short stay at Bangalore, and my work with the US business firm that I was doing, he accidentally noticed the mango slice sized lump on my left cheek. He then enquired about it, and said the growth is near to the left of my parotid gland. I said that the growth had been there for almost a year, when Dr. Kaulgud had done the biopsy, and stated that it was benign. Dr. Uday Kumar told me he respected Dr. Kaulgud so much that he said ‘When Kaulgud Sir has done biopsy, then there can be nothing to comment upon’. </p>
		<p>However, as a precautionary measure, Dr. Uday Kumar said it would be better that I get the lumpy growth condition tested again. He further said “we have a Pathology Lab in this set up, and his wife Dr. Vandana is the Pathologist”. He told me “why don’t you come tomorrow, and get the test done”. I did not have anything to say since the lump on the neck had somehow grown in the meanwhile, and hence I agreed to take the test. </p>
		<p>I decided to go the next day to Dr. Uday Kumar’s Pathology Lab for the test he recommended. Dr. Vandana Grampurohit arrived at the Lab post noon, and said that she would do the FNAC test. She then drew out some fluid from the lump site with a long fine needle, and looking at the fluid drawn, she remarked that the report will be available in 2 days. </p>
		<p>Thereafter, I tried to contact Dr. Vandana Grampurohit, as advised by her, for three consecutive days, but she was not attending to my calls. That made me somehow curious. After waiting for a week, I called Dr. Uday Kumar but he gave me a vague reply. He said the detailed report was being discussed by his wife with the senior doctors at SDM Hospital, Hubli, to which she was attached.</p>
		<p>I could bear no more the strange silence, and decided to barge into the Clinic of Dr. Uday Kumar. The next day I went to Dr. Uday Kumar’s Clinic, driving the tedious route, and walked to his place. I waited for him, like other patients who had come. As he arrived, he broadly smiled at me, and went into his room. After a few minutes he called me in. Then, he started talking about the weather, my work and everything else, except the report. I thought that he was avoiding to tell, or share with me something that I could not take; maybe I’ll get perturbed or be alarmed.</p>
		<p>I became curious at his strange silence. I finally took a deep breath, and decided to open the topic myself. Mustering courage, I asked him about the Lab Report : Doctor, “what is in the report” of FNAC Test; he was silent. Then I asked him a bit loud, “Doc, tell me” what is it : Is it cancer ? Is it malignant ? “Please do not hesitate” to tell me, if it is so. Dr. Uday Kumar was stunned to hear the word ‘cancer’ from me. He promptly said : Kulkarni, you have uttered what I was hesitant to tell; how did you guess that; you are indeed very strong and courageous; and ultimately told ‘Yes’. He clearly said ‘ You have got cancer’. We need to wait till the next day, when the detailed report would be made available. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 3</span>Initial diagnosis of cancer : How cancer is viewed and perceived ?</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he initial diagnosis was out; and it was unbelievable. True, the small gram sized lump had become big enough to be known as cancer, and was malignant. What kind or type of cancer it has been and what stage it is, will be known once the report is available. Instantly, there was a sort of blur in my eyes due to the impact of this news. I became emotional, and felt like screaming; but soon realised that I was in a Clinic, and I tried to collect myself, and regain my composure, while returning to normalcy. I immediately picked up enough courage to ask for a glass of water, which was provided. Then, I got up and started walking to the exit door for reaching home.</p>
		<p>After the unexpected news of my having cancer, an unusual and strange silence pervaded my mind. I was lost in thoughts, and remained mum as well as motionless. I was trying to understand my mind, which was all the while prodding me during the last two years to do something. </p>
		<p>I had hardly imagined that a gram sized or trivial lump on my cheek would one day grow big enough to derail my health condition, and consume me. That I was a cancer candidate dawned on me when Dr. Uday Kumar responded to my question by stating, “Yes, it is Cancer”.</p>
		<p>I really did not know what cancer was or meant, although I had seen the cancer affected from a distance, and heard about it in hushed voices. As it is, people did not have courage / confidence to talk freely about it.</p>
		<p>The word or name cancer is dreaded by almost everyone. It brings out a scary and frightful picture. So much so, that it is another name for death or life’s end. The term is an anathema, and strikes fear in the minds of people. Not just this. It is compared to issue of a warrant for life’s last journey, probably an RAC rail ticket to death as destination. No treatment is said to cure it, no hospital tells when a cancer patient will return to normalcy, and nobody says that the destination can be changed. </p>
		<p>Incidentally, many people hesitate, and are even scared to tell or utter the word cancer, not only by those who are concerned with or affected, but also by common people. I believe, it is an indicator that the life of cancer patients gets just extinguished prematurely or faster. In the course of last three decades, I had known that snake bites and heart attacks used to cause instant death or persons affected by such attacks do not survive. Today, while snake bites are easily treatable, though not so prevalent, heart attacks are common, and easily treatable or manageable. But regardless of cancer survivors, the fear of imminent death arising from the dreadful cancer lingers on. </p>
		<p>Not merely that. Cancer name or term has now become synonymous with, or is attributed to, any catastrophe or disaster or dangerous trends in the region or in the society by political leaders, high society people and even intellectuals, which in reality is neither appropriate nor fair. I cannot reconcile to such a view or perception that the word cancer is so hated or feared, and has become a taboo. </p>
		<p><em>Looking back, I had vaguely heard of my mother’s younger sister and elder brother who stayed in their villages having cancer symptoms, but did not know much about the disease. In course of time, I came to know that they fought the cancer battle, and have eventually survived. </em></p>
		<p><em>However, I had known personally my close colleague Arvind Kulkarni’s aunt, who had cancer of a very rare kind many years ago. Those days people thought that the patient must not know that he or she has cancer. But Arvind’s aunt was a strong willed person. She knew that she had the rarest type of cancer right from day she was diagnosed.</em></p>
		<p><em>It was Arvind’s son who while sitting on his aunt’s lap pointed out towards a ball like growth on her thigh. She had ignored it, but in the course of normal check up, Dr. Hebbal informed Arvind to get the growth examined. He got his aunt thoroughly examined, and the tests were done so fast that within two days it was found and diagnosed as a rare cancer. </em></p>
		<p><em>Arvind took courage and informed her about this slowly and softly. But the reaction from his aunt was rather surprising. She responded “Yes, is it cancer ? Whatever type it is, maybe it will take my life sooner or later. I will live happily, as long as I am alive, as I have nothing to worry about; she informed Arvind to take care of his uncle in case the cancer consumed her. She informed everyone who visited her that she has cancer, and her days are numbered. She assigned all her family responsibilities to Arvind, and advised him that he was absolutely free to take any decision about her treatment plan.</em></p>
		<p>The case of Arvind’s aunt was unlike mine. It took about two years to correctly and finally diagnose that I had cancer. And that happened only after an ENT Surgeon Dr. Uday Kumar, while examining my ear condition accidently noticed a lump on my cheek, and enquired about it. I told him of the FNAC test done by senior Surgeon Dr. Kaulgud at Dharwad a year ago, but it was finally diagnosed and confirmed that the growth is benign, and benign only, with advice that there is no cause for any concern. Dr. Uday Kumar, however, was of the considered view that it was preferable and advisable to go in for a fresh test. </p>
		<p><em>Incidentally, Arvind’s aunt was finally operated at Dharwad’s Sarvamangala Hospital. Arvind and I were at the Hospital when the surgery was done, not knowing how serious was the damage caused by her cancer. When the door of OT opened, and Sr. Surgeon Dr. Kulgod came out, followed by a nurse with a plastic pot carrying the operated and separated flesh portion, and showed the mass to Arvind and me, it was deep red and some </em><em>grey</em><em> black semi-fluid about three kg mass, and we did not know why so much flesh was removed. Dr. Kulgod told us that the spread out was so much, and all this mass needed to be sent to Bangalore for biopsy, to know and confirm the extent to which the cancer had spread.</em></p>
		<p><em>Arvind’s aunt was still unconscious, but after a few hours, she gained her consciousness when smilingly she informed us that the dirt of cancer was removed, and we need not worry. Great, I thought. Instead of our having to comfort and counsel her for having confidence and courage, it was she, in her semi conscious state, who told us not to worry. That reaffirmed my belief how a strong willed person can make a difference. I must say that she is a brave lady, who not only came out of cancer, winning the tough battle, and living happily and free from cancer, with her husband. </em></p>
		<p>All these scenes were coming before my mind’s eye when I was mechanically driving back home from Dr. Udaya Kumar’s Clinic. </p>
		<p>Whom and how I should inform first ? Arati or Nalu ? Not knowing how they would react ? I decided to stop the vehicle for a moment on the road and think. I pulled the vehicle to one side. Tried to collect myself, but could not imagine what their response or reaction will be like. Eventually, I decided to talk to Arati first, as she was comparatively a strong willed person like me. I called Arati’s number from my mobile.</p>
		<p>Hello Beta, how are you ?</p>
		<p>OK Daddy, was the response from her.</p>
		<p>Did you all have your lunch ?</p>
		<p>Yes, daddy, kids are upstairs, and Vijay has gone out on some work. </p>
		<p>Arati, I was with Dr. Uday Kumar Grampurohit for my ear check up, and I got a report just today.</p>
		<p>What report ! Hope, everything is OK</p>
		<p>Yeah !</p>
		<p>But listen.</p>
		<p>Listen carefully till I complete.</p>
		<p>She was a little perturbed as to why I was talking like this, but said yes in silent mode.</p>
		<p>Listen Beta, I was coming here for more than a week now for my audiogram and hearing test.</p>
		<p>Is the audiogram OK ?</p>
		<p>Yes, but some thing else is wrong slightly </p>
		<p>What ?</p>
		<p>Incidentally, his wife Dr. Vandana being a Pathologist, was instructed to take my FNAC test for the growth on the left parotid gland.</p>
		<p>She said what ? She was perturbed that something wrong must be revealing in this pathology test report; maybe, she guessed.</p>
		<p>The report says that the lump growth is malignant, and Dr. Uday tells that I have cancer. </p>
		<p>The news may have jolted her as there was stony silence. I said Hello, Hello repeatedly; but there was no answer. I wanted to make sure that she is OK.</p>
		<p>Then I continued : Beta, suno, I am OK, let us wait and see; you don’t have to get unnecessarily upset; we can talk about it.</p>
		<p>I have so far not informed this to your Mummy. Infact, I am on my way home; once I reach home, let me see what to do. </p>
		<p>Arati said, I am OK Daddy; you take care of yourself, and take care of Mummy. I will speak to Vijay and come back.</p>
		<p>I said OK.</p>
		<p>My daughter Arati was the first person after me in our family to know that I have cancer.</p>
		<p>I started the car, and began driving home. The drive in normal time is about 10 minutes, but this day it looked as though the time had stopped, and those ten minutes appeared like an hour.</p>
		<p>I reached home, slowly walked up to the door, and half– heartedly rang the bell. My wife Nalu opened the door.</p>
		<p>No sooner I entered our house, and sat down, she first asked me “What has happened, you took so long to get the report; is the report OK, and many questions, but my answer was just silence.</p>
		<p>I asked for a glass of water. After giving the glass of water, she said : Come, it is already too late, have lunch, and we can talk thereafter.</p>
		<p>I decided to wait for a while to gauge her mood, and readily agreed for lunch. Apparently, Arati had not spoken to her in the meantime. I was also composed and calm. Thus, there was no need to share the breaking news till our lunch was over. After we finished our lunch, we went to sit and relax in our room.</p>
		<p>I really did not know how to open the subject matter. I could not imagine how she would react; how she would take it, because she is a heavy diabetic. I collected myself, took a deep breath and said : Listen Nalu, I got my report.</p>
		<p>She promptly told : For your hearing problem ?</p>
		<p>No. </p>
		<p>Then ?</p>
		<p>It is with regard to the Biopsy and FNAC done for the growth on my cheek.</p>
		<p>You said everything is OK, and you will grow beard if required. If that is the only thing that makes you happy, you may go ahead.</p>
		<p>I said : No, not that; the problem is not of growing beard, but the lump.</p>
		<p>What about it ?</p>
		<p>Dr. Udaya Kumar said it is malignant. But I know for certain that she did not understand the term or word ‘malignant’. I told her again in a softer tone; the Doctor says it is cancer.</p>
		<p>I then kept my gaze fixed at her to see her reaction; she was like a person felled by a hard hitting object, and she was motionless. </p>
		<p>There was simply no reaction.</p>
		<p>I was worried. Be assured Nalu, everything will be OK I said. I have spoken to Arati about it, and Vijay was not there. Let’s see.</p>
		<p>And to avoid elaboration and discussion on this matter, I told her that I was very much tired, and would like to lie down.</p>
		<p>She understood that I did not want to scare or frighten her by discussing the subject matter further, and said OK.</p>
		<p>But before she uttered the two alphabets O and K, there were tear drops, one from her right eye, and the other from the left rolled down on her cheeks, she tried to wipe the tears while walking out of the room. </p>
		<p>I did lie down for some time with my eyes wide open on the bed, rolled to the right and left, but could not rest.</p>
		<p>I heard Nalu speaking to a relative on phone. It appears that was her brother Kant crying, and told him that I had cancer. Her mother was also at Dharwad then. </p>
		<p>The breaking news was out. It was about 2 pm in the afternoon, and I was still lying down in my room when the doorbell rang.</p>
		<p>My mother-in-law, my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law and a couple of relatives in Dharwad arrived. They were in our drawing room, all of them being silent, and not uttering a word. </p>
		<p>In just five minutes time, my domestic help came in to tell me to come to the drawing room, as many of our relatives had come to see me. But I thought I’ll go there after a while. I did not want to go there instantly, as they would all start crying, and say so many things, which would make me feel isolated, and bring about negative thoughts. </p>
		<p>I waited for the sombre situation to quieten, with the initial crying getting over, and then only I would go there. After about half an hour or so, I decided to meet them. Changed my Kurta, and went into the drawing room. Then, I pulled my plastic chair, and sat in the middle, so that I could see all of them, and they may also see me eye to eye.</p>
		<p>It was obvious that all of those who had come looked grim and downcast. Before saying anything, my brother-in-law broke down and started crying. I had to console him first. I, therefore, told him : “Don’t cry. What has happened ? Everything will be OK, and I will fight. And I am not going to die; so, don’t worry”. There was again silence, no one said anything, because no one knew what to say. I had virtually taken charge of the situation courageously, and assuring them that I was going to fight the battle, come what may. It was my readiness to face the most difficult situation with grit and determination that had the effect of calming and assuring the lot of relatives assembled then. </p>
		<p>They all knew that I had faced and handled hostile conditions and turmoil in my factory life and career with courage and confidence. I was known for having a never die spirit in whatever risks and responsibilities I had taken up and executed. It had given me mental strength and fortitude to overcome challenges and life threatening situations. Having consoled and reassured all of them that I was ready to face the difficult and troubled times, they apparently reconciled to the situation. </p>
		<p>It is common and natural in our society for relatives, friends and known people to turn up at, and come to, the places of the cancer affected or to hospitals where cancer patients are being treated, and console them or offer sympathies. On the contrary, here was a situation, where I had to counsel and comfort all of those who had come to see me. Thus, it turned out to be an unusual scenario.</p>
		<p>Nalu and the remaining relatives were talking for some time after I left, and I could hear her telling them that whatever is going to happen will happen, and there is no point in crying about it. She said that we should handle the situation carefully, while being ready to face whatever comes. </p>
		<p>That is what I wanted to hear from her. She had indeed mustered courage, and braced herself for addressing the predicament and challenge in which I was placed. I sensed that Nalu had become ready for the next action plan. I felt stronger in my resolve to overcome the cancer stigma. </p>
		<p>All of them went to their homes after promising and committing to help Nalini, saying that she could contact them for help anytime. This was her family support that gave her strength, and I also felt reassured. </p>
		<p>Then, as she walked into the bedroom, she said “I’ll make some tea, it is already 4 pm. I hope you will have a cup of tea” to which I agreed.</p>
		<p>Whereupon I asked her to sit for a moment. And thankfully endorsed her balanced response and practical approach. I did appreciate and commend her acceptance of this huge setback, and regaining equanimity so quickly.</p>
		<p>I thereafter told her that I would like to speak to Arati for the next step to be taken, and I dialled her number. Hello Daddy ?.</p>
		<p>Before talking further, she enquired about Mummy and how she had taken the disturbing news. I said I must appreciate her shock absorption easily, and the strength of her mind to take the matter in her stride. </p>
		<p>I realised that both Arati and Nalu were ready to bolster my strength required to face the difficult situation.</p>
		<p>While I tried to talk to Arati further, Vijay pulled the phone from Arati’s hand in the meantime, and started speaking. Assertively, he said ‘Daddy be ready to come to Bangalore, we are already at Tumkur, and will be reaching Dharwad by late evening’. I informed about their plan to Nalu. She was also surprised at the way things were developing so fast.</p>
		<p>By evening, Arati and Vijay had arrived. After the initial exchanges, Vijay had a detailed look at the report. I told him that the final report from SDM Hospital was expected the next day, whereas the Lab Report had indicated malignancy of the lump. They even saw the benign Biopsy Report made at German Hospital. We decided to leave for Bangalore the next day early morning after collecting the Biopsy and FNAC Reports.. </p>
		<p>That night I spoke to my son Raju who was at New Jersey in US, and informed him about the onset of cancer. While I felt he was momentarily taken aback, he took the news in his stride, and told me to scan and mail the reports to him. He would consult Dr.&#160;Anita Desai, an Oncologist at a Hospital in New Jersey, US, whom he knew.</p>
		<p>Next day was 10th August 2011, a day of reckoning ! By 8.30 am, we all were ready to leave for Bangalore for the ultimate diagnosis. On our way to Hubli, we reached SDM Hospital, where Vijay met our Dharwad based Pathologist Dr. Vandana Grampurohit, and collected the FNAC report. </p>
		<p>In the Report, it was noted that the FNAC of left Parotid Swelling was suggestive of lymphoma or malignant tumour of lymphoid tissues / cells, and called as non - Hodgkin’s lymphoma. At last, I came to know the type of Cancer that was ultimately diagnosed, and is known by this medical name. I saw the report myself with a sense of disbelief. For about half an hour I did not utter a word, as I was engrossed in understanding the report. </p>
		<p>Breaking the silence in our car journey, Arati uttered Daddy, “I had heard  that undiagnosed  fever remaining for long is indicative of the affected person nurturing cancer inside !“ If this was true, it meant that for about a year while I was in Bangalore before shifting to Dharwad, my body was apparently hosting cancer ! But I told her that it is well accepted that cancer cells reside in every human body. At some point of time, they get triggered due to one or several factors, and start multiplying, which would lead to manifestation of cancer signs or symptoms. How come the incessant fever that I used to get till the last week was not regarded or considered as one of the early signs or symptoms of cancer, when persistent fever is medically recognised as one of the signs of lymphoma cancer ? But, you never know. Ironically, the one that had suddenly abated or disappeared in a week with the help of simple medication by Dr. Raikar, was lipoma fat cell. </p>
		<p><strong>Annexure I to Part One of this Book, details the signs and symptoms of cancer, as well as warning signals in certain types of cancer, which is useful reference material for all those concerned with, or interested in, cancer. </strong></p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 4</span>Seeking 2nd opinion : final diagnosis of cancer; Eventually, looking for treatment at Bangalore</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">J</span>ust how important is the message or signal “Listen to your body” ? Though in my case, despite constantly listening to, prodding and pushing my body, no Doctor could help in telling me that cancer was residing in me for a long period, or rather I was hosting it since the time I was getting continuous and regular fever. It had then remained undiagnosed, but got resolved on its own. </p>
		<p>Finally, I came to know of my having cancer after the FNAC test carried out by a senior pathologist at Dharwad, who was attached to SDM Hospital, Hubli. It was then decided that we go in for a second opinion for our satisfaction. While the critical importance of early diagnosis for effective treatment of cancer is well known and emphasised, it is rather unfortunate that I was finally diagnosed as having cancer after two long years. As such, I was not in a position to assess whether I was early or late in being diagnosed as having cancer, and without knowing its stage. But I decided not to bother further about this matter. </p>
		<p>At that moment while on way to Bangalore, I did not know at what stage my cancer was, or how serious the condition was inside. All that I could say, having become a cancer case, the lump on my left parotid area was called as non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. A wonderful medical term or name of cancer I had got. What a tongue twister ! </p>
		<p>I only came to know subsequently that the non Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosed in me as cancer was not the same one that Dr. Kaulgud had observed earlier, upon conducting biopsy of the lumpy growth in my cheek, and reportedly told us that it was lipoma fat cell, and benign. Thus, the earlier reported lumpy growth was possibly misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all as cancer. On the other hand, the final and formal diagnosis was arrived at on the basis of FNCA Report of Dr. Vandana Grampurohit, and duly verified by the SDM Hospital thereof. It ultimately turned out to be malignancy of the lymphatic nodes, and called as lymphoma or medically known as non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. </p>
		<p>We were getting down at Davangere for lunch. Every one appeared to be so much concerned about me, advising me to be careful, and to move slowly. It was as if a serious accident victim was being admitted to a Hospital for an emergency condition or when a patient is discharged from Hospital after major surgery. Instantaneously, Vijay came to help me getting down from car. Someone pulled a chair for me, while another relative was helping me to sit. Apparently, it was the typical sympathetic and sensitive concern for me as a serious patient, all happening to me in just one day after I was declared a cancer candidate, though nothing physically or for that matter even emotionally had changed in me. </p>
		<p>I was not prepared for all this, as I was feeling physically alright, and did not like feigning ill. I did not want anyone to support me to alight from the car. I was normal, rather feeling fine without any impact of, or effect from cancer. I always believed and felt being fit and independent. </p>
		<p>I was naturally confronted in my mind with the question whether cancer is reversible or curable. I had heard, and I believe, as most allopathic doctors say that cancer cannot be cured. However, it is definitely treatable. As in case of diabetes, with all kinds of alternative and complementary therapies available, one need not fear diabetes; one can live with diabetes by keeping it under control. There are medicines to control diabetes; there are special foods for diabetes; there are sugar free sweets for diabetes; sugar substitutes, food substitutes, etc. With all kinds of treatment options and methods, medical facilities, complementary and alternative therapies, diabetes has becoming a friendly disease. So much so, that you can live with diabetes without fear and worries. I am strengthened in my belief and understanding that diabetics can live without compromising in life, going by the example of how my better half Nalini has been able to manage it. I was, therefore, wondering why cancer cannot be managed like diabetes.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the causes of cancer are not clearly known, and it still remains a mystery. It cannot be said what specific factors or conditions contribute to the cancer disease. Or, why and how it occurs ?. But it is commonly believed, and even medically held that smoking, exposure to hazardous chemicals, pollution and radiation, genetic factors, etc. contribute to the incidence of cancer. Insofar as I am concerned, I have been a non-smoker, vegetarian, teetotaller and a health freak doing exercises since long, maybe for the last over two decades, though I was not regular and strict in my habits and practices in the earlier years. Earlier I used to eat paan and supari, but gave them up after settling down in Dharwad. Apart from the above healthy habits and practices, I have been used to getting up early morning by 4.30 am, and after wash and freshening do regular Yoga and Pranayama besides some exercises. </p>
		<p>With such reasonably healthy habits and practices, as well as a regular schedule of work and exercises that I was having, I felt that I was not a right candidate for hosting the hostile cancer. I was a wrong address for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Neither did I have any of the common or prevalent symptoms or signs which would facilitate early detection. But there was no Doctor or Specialist, much less any authority to tell me how and why I got cancer. That would remain an unresolved question. </p>
		<p>At this point of our journey, we were nearing Bangalore. We halted for a while at Tumkur, freshened up and had tea. Then, we commenced the last lap of our road journey. We reached Bangalore around 8.30 pm, but my mind was still wandering and exploring how I should brace for the eventuality of confronting and befriending the great non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. I had decided to take it easy; behave normal even if the treatment meant torture to my body; not to worry about it, and also not to be a cause for worry by relatives and others.</p>
		<p>Finally, we reached the Villa of Vijay and Arati at Adarsh Vista Vignan Nagar in Bangalore at about 8.30 pm. Vijay said that let us not discuss anything that day, and leave it to the next day for deciding our steps, when Raju was expected to arrive with wife Madhu and daughter Rhea from New Jersey, US. As scheduled, they arrived late in the night.</p>
		<p>My mind in the morning was preoccupied with the question of taking some alternate therapy, as modern medicine / allopathy, I was told, to be very costly, and having side effects, and no individual insurance cover was available. Moreover, the pain, suffering and side effects associated with chemotherapy were inevitable, which I had heard about. Thus, it was just blank as no therapy or system was known to cure cancer. No answer or assurance was forthcoming. </p>
		<p>We were all sitting and sipping coffee in the morning. Impulsively, Raju and Vijay started telling simultaneously to me : “You do not have to worry about any matter, money, method and even the duration of treatment, and I should not even think of suggesting any cheaper alternative”, as they both had apparently discussed and decided all matters relating to my cancer treatment. They repeated again that I need not worry at all, but completely surrender to them. I was further told that I did not have choice or freedom in the matter before the treatment is complete in all respects. Much as I wanted to know or understand the options and preferences available for effective and painless therapy for fighting the battle of cancer, I had just no choice or voice. This modality of surrender or submission to my son and son-in-law was possibly against my typical independent thinking and logical approach. However, realising the gravity of the sensitive situation, I had to reconcile with the ground realities. Then, acknowledging their concern as well as assumption of responsibility, I conceded and confided to them; and readily gave in. Meantime, I switched off the matter from my mind, and asked it to rest.</p>
		<p>It was felt that we first go to HCG, the acclaimed Cancer Specialist for a second opinion or double check of what was diagnosed. We thought of HCG as my brother’s son-in-law Dr. Jagannath Dixit was working as Onco Surgeon there. We felt that he could arrange for a speedy check up. </p>
		<p>When we went to the HCG Cancer Centre on 11th August 2011, Dr. Dixit did a preliminary check up of the growth in my cheek by touch and feel method. He then took the slide which we had carried with us, and gave it for verification by sending me for PET scan to confirm the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and for marking the stage of my Cancer. We had to wait in the scan room for Multi Gated Nuclear Test (Muga Scan), Sugar Test, Blood Pressure and Blood Reports. By late afternoon my stomach was empty, and I was ready for taking PET scan, which was done quickly. </p>
		<p>It was then confirmed that I have been diagnosed with cancer, and it is non-Hodgkins lymphoma, as per the Lab Reports verified at SDM Hospital.</p>
		<p>Meantime, I was asked if I wished to take a special Blood Test for checking its compatibility with Rituximab Mabthera Chemo Drug. If my report was going to be positive, I was told that I could be considered lucky, as Mabthera enhances the efficacy of Chemotherapy. I took the said test, and the report was positive. </p>
		<p>The slide report verification confirmed the presence of malignancy leading to the diagnosis of my cancer as non - Hodgkin’s lymphoma. While the Report from Muga Scan was OK, the Pet Scan report said something. This Report was so much technical and detailed that I did not understand. We had to wait for the doctor to explain. With this report, we went to Dr. Dixit, who confirmed that the evaluation at HCG concurred with the report of the Pathologist attached to SDM Hospital. </p>
		<p>Next day we reached HCG for a discussion on the status of my cancer condition and plan of treatment. The HCG Medical Team of Oncologists led by Chairman Dr. B.S. Ajay Kumar, called us at about 4.00 pm at their Conference Room in Tower 3, and we were greeted by him, Dr. Dixit and Dr. Radhey Shyam. Dr. Dixit and Dr. Ajay Kumar told me that looking at the prognosis of my cancer condition, they assured that it is treatable and manageable. They informed me of the Protocol for Chemotherapy treatment, and estimated that 6 Chemo Cycles will be administered at 21 days interval from the first Chemo. Accordingly, they gave me the Protocol for the 1st Chemo as under :</p>
		<p>Rituximab-100 mg</p>
		<p>Cyclophosphamide-100 mg</p>
		<p>Vincristine-2 mg</p>
		<p>Adriamycin-70 mg</p>
		<p>I was informed with graphics that my cancer was at Stage III A. </p>
		<p><strong>Understanding Cancer Stage, and the Staging of Cancer </strong></p>
		<p>I was, however, curious to know how this staging was done, and asked Dr. Ajay Kumar to tell me. Dr. Ajay Kumar explained the staging of cancer in detail. He told that for the staging purposes, the torso is divided into 4 parts, and while a vertical line passing from the middle of our forehead is drawn till the naval, a horizontal line at the heart level is drawn which would intersect with the earlier line at the midpoint. If the cancer spread is within one sector of the overall area, then it is Stage I; if the spread is in two adjacent sectors, it is Stage II; when it is spread to the third sector of the lower half, then it is Stage III, and finally with cancer spreading or metastasizing to other organs, it is Stage IV and beyond.</p>
		<p>To my query as to how much time would be given for enabling me to go in for the Chemo, I was put to complete ease. Dr. Ajay Kumar smilingly told that there was no hurry. I was free to start taking the Chemo from the next day or the next week or the next month. He assured me that I was in the best hands, and they would take complete care of me. I was also told that if I so desired, I was free to take another opinion in the matter, and that for my cancer condition, the treatment and the Chemo protocol in any Cancer Hospital would be the same.</p>
		<p>That very night Raju sent the Report along with the Chemo protocol to the US Oncologist Dr. Anita Desai. She confirmed the cancer diagnosis and said the protocol was Okay. </p>
		<p>As a last resort, we went to Manipal Hospital the next day to see our relative Dr. Mohan Badgandi, who put us to another known Medical Oncologist Dr. Purna Patil for arriving at a final decision on my cancer status. Dr. Purna Patil checked the reports and the prescribed protocol, apart from physically checking my neck, shoulder and back for any swelling or pain. Looking again at the Reports, she said that the cancer had spread to many areas (i.e., metastasized) through blood, and the Stage III A Cancer had to be treated as fast as possible. </p>
		<p>As we returned home and sat at the dinner table, Vijay, Raju and Arati asked me if it was OK with the proposed line of treatment, though I was free to decide which Hospital I would like to go for Chemotherapy. I said I would prefer to be treated at HCG, because I felt at ease and assured. The next question was when do we go for the treatment without losing further time. Understanding the action plan, I told Vijay that I would like to go to Dharwad for a day to bring some clothes to wear, and other essential things for enabling us to remain in Bangalore for my treatment. </p>
		<p>Raju, Nalu and I decided to fly to Dharwad the next day morning. We reached Dharwad in the afternoon. As I was entering my home ‘Aashraya’, I became emotional and nostalgic of home and its environment, not knowing when I would return. Nalu got busy with packing as many clothes and things as required for our stay duration of about 6 months. I also decided to have my normal haircut. We were ready with sufficient clothes and things packed, and took the flight back to Bangalore the next day to be ready to face the cancer battle.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 5</span>Fitness and suitability tests before taking<br />Chemotherapy modality of treatment</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>e had some laughter, chatter and banter followed by food before readying for the marathon of taking six Chemo cycles.</p>
		<p>Our only concern at this stage was that my body must respond favourably to the first Chemotherapy cycle. I had come to know that Chemotherapy usually produces severe side effects. They could even be devastating to a majority of cancer patients. But, as a short term measure, it is known to attack cancerous cells, and possibly bring about prognosis and alleviation in the disease. It is well known that conventional or mainstream medicine and drugs invariably produce side effects or reactions. In other words, if they do not produce any side effects, then they would not be effective at all or doing anything.</p>
		<p>By the way, out of deriving some sort of emotional satisfaction, I thought of meeting as many close relatives and friends before the start of my Chemotherapy cycles. Among my several close friends in Bangalore was J.S. Pant, since 30 years, a lawyer and former colleague of mine on the Board of Star Volkmann Ltd., a German Collaboration Co., manufacturing textile machinery at Dharwad, where I had moved to. When I went to see him in his office at Seshadripuram accompanied by Vijay and Raju, he told me that I looked like a fit and fighting soldier, little knowing that beneath my calm and composed exterior, I was hosting the dreaded cancer. After initial pleasantries, I told him that ‘I had Cancer, and it is non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Stage III A’. Initially, he was taken aback, but accepting the reality said it is treatable and manageable. Trying to prop me up, he told me not to get unduly worried and perturbed, as he knew I was a strong willed person. Further, he said that he had seen in me the firm determination and grit to fight and overcome such setbacks. Guiding and advising me to read some of the best, inspiring and transformational books or material by cancer survivors, he gave me a small book titled “The Joy of Cancer” written by Anup Kumar, a corporate communications executive. He suggested that I read it, and assured it will help me in facing cancer confidently and bravely.</p>
		<p>After an hour or so, we left the place carrying best wishes for speedy recovery from Pant, and started driving back home to Adarsh Vista. By the time we reached home, there were messages from several relatives and in-laws awaiting us. They were on their way to see me to wish well and fast recovery, apart from having one last meeting with me.</p>
		<p>They all knew I had cancer, and hence the need for telling that I was in Bangalore for treatment did not arise. Each one suggested different ways to derive strength to face the cancer battle and challenge. Nanda, my sister-in-law, Nalu’s immediate sister; Ramesh, my co-brother and Sudha, my youngest sister-in-law were all there remaining silent, without knowing what to say. All of them had the same question of what will happen to me next; and whether this would be one of our last meetings. All of them bade us farewell, and left quietly one by one. We, thereafter, went to our hall for a quick dinner, and then retired for the day. </p>
		<p>The following day, we agreed to be at HCG, and line up for the scheduled tests before going in for the Chemo cycles. I went along with daughter Arati to HCG on 16th August for meeting Dr. Radhey Shyam, the senior Medical Oncologist, who was going to treat me. While we were seated in the Hall waiting for our turn to meet him, we heard a very loud and wailing voice of a woman coming from the adjoining Minor OT Room. I was wondering what was the terrible loud cry therefrom. We were told that Bone Marrow was being extracted from a female cancer patient. It sounded so painful and unbearable as to scare and frighten anybody. I thought since I was scheduled to undergo the Bone Marrow Test in due course, let me prepare myself mentally and physically to withstand and tolerate the impact of this formidable test.</p>
		<p>17th August 2011 was going to be commencement of D day for me. Beginning with the real tests, the day that would decide how I would respond; the day that would set the path and tone of my treatment. I was naturally getting ready for the crucial day. Not being sure as to when I would come back, while preparing for the cancer battle, before leaving home for the HCG Cancer Centre, I hugged Nalini as a parting gesture.</p>
		<p>In the morning, both Vijay and Raju were ready for accompanying me to the HCG. On reaching HCG by 8 am, we were directed to go first to the Registration Counter. As we entered the Hospital in Tower 1, we saw the waiting hall on the left side, where all cancer patients and accompanying relatives or family friends with prior appointments, had assembled. </p>
		<p>There were about 15 to 20 patients with worried and forlorn looks writ large on their faces, and most of them having lost hair on their scalps. The patients were waiting for their turn, and perhaps carrying with them the virtual RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) rail ticket to unknown destination. I was somewhat perturbed at this awful sight. At once, I felt and decided that I would not like to be part of such motley crowd of cancer patients, with grim and horrible faces or expressions. I didn’t want to join this gathering of wonderful cancer patients, come what may. </p>
		<p>Luckily, on the right side of the entrance to Tower 1, the HCG Cancer Centre had arranged interestingly a small but beautiful Art Gallery, which provides a welcome change to the group of cancer patients and the cancer concerned, and a sense of relief cum joy to the visitors. There were life studies, landscapes, figurative and abstract expressions, and one could spend any length of time looking at the painting rows. I said to myself that ‘this is where I’ll stand and enjoy paintings, artwork and colour pics for any length of time’, but will not walk to the left side waiting hall. The HCG Art Gallery became my regular halting point, before going in for any tests and the chemo cycles treatment. </p>
		<p>While standing there at the Art Gallery my mind started wandering and thinking about a world within the world. A different world of, by and for Cancer Patients : some serious, while some others more serious; with heads looking down to the ground below or in front of them. They were appearing as though they were completely cut off from what is happening in front of them. I was not able to say if they were experiencing untold pain and suffering, or were just thinking about how the end would come. </p>
		<p>Meanwhile, someone called my name from the Reception Counter that it was my turn now to see the Doctor. I reached the entrance of the Consultation Room. Behind the door was an attending nurse waiting with Blood Pressure Gauge, and Instrument for testing Blood Sugar. When asked if I was a diabetic, I said ‘No’. Then, she checked my sugar level and found it normal. But when my blood pressure was checked, it was slightly higher than normal. Thereafter, I was taken to the radioactive area, where I had to undergo muga scan again after radioactive injection was given. The muga scan indicated that it was also normal.</p>
		<p>Vijay took me to a Room in Tower 4, and said I could rest there till the next procedure is taken up. However, Dr. Radhey Shyam recommended that I undergo one more Ultrasound Guided FNAC, as reconfirmation of the diagnosis from the HCG Lab for arriving at definite conclusions before the Bone Marrow procedure.</p>
		<p>I reached the first floor of Tower 2 for Ultrasound Guided FNAC test. The procedure was carried out by a Senior Pathologist, who confirmed that the Cancer I had was non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but added a suffix to it and wrote that it was Indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. It meant that my cancer was a milder and gentle one, and not aggressive. To my question as to how many types of Lymphomas are there, I was told that it is aggressive, galloping and indolent. I felt that I was lucky to the extent that my Lymphoma cancer was of a milder variety.</p>
		<p><strong>Bone Marrow Extraction Test : the last of tests for eliminating semblance of metastasis or spread of cancer</strong></p>
		<p>This was the first test of my endurance to bear with such pain. It would demonstrate my resilience to absorb the impact of torture on me without letting it out, and to take the bull by its horn. </p>
		<p>I checked into a comfortable room upstairs in Tower 4 of HCG. I changed over to the hospital uniform, and awaited the preparatory work being done by the paramedical staff for conducting the critical test. Once the tools and arrangement were readied, the attending specialist Dr. Smita walked in. She asked me to lie down on my side, and not to worry while telling me that it will pain a bit, but would be tolerable. I had known about the intensity of pain in this procedure from the screaming of Bone Marrow Test case done a day before, and I was ready for the said Test. </p>
		<p>To begin with, a local anaesthesia was given deep inside the spinal cord. The pain was not so tolerable, but my body shivered. The next part of the procedure seemed worse, since a similar needle which was connected to a suction pump, would be inserted into the spinal system to draw some bone marrow fluid, and collect it in a small receptacle. For the second time, the Doctor pushed the long needle inside my spinal cord, while a medical assistant started the suction pump. The pain was really unbearable, and as I was not shouting or screaming then, my hands had become numb with the pulling of the bed railing. I found that some light yellow fluid from my spinal cord was extracted, and the Doctor said OK. I was thus relieved. I must say this Bone Marrow Extraction procedure had made me stronger inside, to face the following mighty Chemotherapy. </p>
		<p>The bone marrow extraction was sent to the lab instantly for checking, as Dr. Dixit was pushing to get the assessment done as fast as possible. Within half an hour, the report came, and to my great relief I was told that the cancer in me had not spread to the bone, submerging all the pain I underwent. It was thus an unforgettable episode in Testing. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 6</span>Bracing for the crucial Chemotherapy </h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>t was comforting to know that I cleared the decks of suitability and eligibility tests for taking the crucial Chemotherapy modality of treatment. I set about bracing myself for the uphill task. </p>
		<p>The para medical staff had made arrangement of keeping all the required things, instruments and facilities ready for my Chemotherapy treatment. We had to wait for the Medical Oncologist Dr. Radhey Shyam to come, and satisfy that everything was in order for commencing the treatment. Only then, he would administer the first Chemo Cycle. But the time was dragging, and it turned out to be too long. </p>
		<p>I was in the Hospital since early morning, and remaining without food made me feel hungry and terrible. Vijay and Raju were regularly enquiring the medical staff about the availability of Dr. Radhey Shyam, and when he was coming. We were told that Dr. Radhey Shyam was on his way to our Hospital, but with the time ticking, there was no sign of him then. While Vijay was losing patience, Dr. Radhey Shyam walked into the room, and started telling how he was required to attend emergencies. The problem was handled tactfully by Raju, who accordingly requested Dr. Radhey Shyam to proceed with the treatment. By then, the time was 8.30 pm.</p>
		<p>To commence, hydration was started with one litre bottle, though the drip was set at slow pace; it was said that the first hydration would take about two hours. Such 5 Litre dripping had to be taken, and the total estimated time was 12 hours. Being the first Chemo Cycle, the dripping had to be done gradually. Thus, I had to bear with all this silently.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, I heard an announcement on the public address system of the Hospital calling for the attention of Dr. Radhey Shyam, which said : “Patient No. 1122 in Tower 3 collapsing rapidly, Dr. Radhey Shyam to rush”. He literally ran out from our room to attend the emergency call. When Dr. Radhey Shyam came back after some time, Raju and Vijay met him, and sought his detailed advice or instructions for me. He took them outside the Room, and gave instructions.</p>
		<p>I believe the Doctor informed them that either of them should remain awake throughout the night, keep a constant vigil and observe any kind of reactions. Particularly, when Adriamycin is administered, there may possibly be some reaction or otherwise. Between them, it was decided that Raju would stay back for the night, and Vijay would leave for home and rest. </p>
		<p>Arati had already left for home to prepare food for Raju and Vijay in case both returned. No one expected that the Chemo procedure would continue throughout the night till next day morning, </p>
		<p>I was relaxing on the bed with Canola and the Hydration Bottle hanging on my left side of the bed. Raju then walked into the room at 10.30 pm in the night, and had a look at the bottle. He estimated that it would take another 40 to 45 minutes for the bottle to get emptied, while the liquid content was being absorbed in my body. Thereafter, when the first bottle of Hydration got emptied, Raju informed the attending nurse. The next medicine to be given was chemotherapy drug - a mix of cyclophosphamide vincristine and rituximab. Though not much reaction was expected, Raju said he would keep tab on it by remaining awake, but told me to close my eyes and sleep.</p>
		<p><strong>Healing Power of Spirituality : Prayer and Meditation</strong></p>
		<p>It is believed, known and accepted that God, the Almighty; Religion; Prayer and Meditation bring about some kind of relief and healing to the seriously ill and suffering patients, including those afflicted with life threatening diseases such as cancer. I have been a religious person and ardent devotee of Sri Raghavendra Swamy of Mantralaya. My father used to recite aloud the stotra when we were children, and we learnt it by heart. I was also regularly praying and worshipping Hala Ganesha, our family deity. There were several incidents in my life which had reinforced my faith in these divine forces. Worshipping them regularly came naturally to me. I made sure of praying to them during the times of crisis. </p>
		<p>People having chronic and serious ailments including cancer are known to tap the innerspiritual side for relief and consolation. This might include chanting, prayer, reading passages from holy books, or simply expressing gratitude. It may not have been possible to scientifically establish or prove that spiritualism helps in healing and provides reliefs, or in lessening the overall pain or severity in treatment, side effects, etc. </p>
		<p>In my case, I was surprised to note that as soon as the bottle after the Hydration was plugged in, without my being aware, my mind started repeating gurumantra <em>“Pujyaya Raghavendraya Sathya Dharma Rathayacha, Bhajatam Kalpa Vrukshaya Namatham Kamadehnave” </em>continuously non-stop till the bottle was over, and beyond. This was not due to any conscious effort on my part; it was automatic like a tape recorder playing from my mind. I could not switch it off, and I had to, therefore, let it go on.</p>
		<p>Symbolically, this mantra seemed to provide full cover and protection to me throughout the treatment. Even during change over, the recording of this chanting was going on in my mind non-stop till the whole chemo cycle was over. This pleasantly surprised me. I did not know who was monitoring all this, who was putting this on, and who would switch off and on, as the controls were not with me. </p>
		<p>I was told the next bottle was the main Chemo. The duty doctor was present when the nurse was connecting the Chemo bottle, and adjusting the rate of flow. The flow rate was set in tandem with the rate at which the drops were going through the catheter window. I was told that it would take about two hours for the bottle to empty. </p>
		<p>The Chemotherapy drug in liquid form was Adriamycin, and red in colour. I was told that the Chemo liquid drug was corrosive and highly toxic; hence it had to be kept at a distance. Raju was given special instructions to keep tab and non - stop watch on the bottle till it was over, because it was this Chemo drug which causes reactions, and feared by patients. </p>
		<p>Dripping slowly through the veins of my hand, the liquid got into my body and to all the systems. While Raju was engrossed, I was reciting the stotra in my mind spontaneously, without any effort on my part. The stotra was being recited as though it was coming automatically from my mind, without my knowing. As the Chemo liquid flow was about to be over, I felt rather relieved, saying that God is great. Apparently, the liquid had hardly any reaction and adverse effect on me. I had taken it in my stride without much problem. I felt happy at undergoing the first cycle of Chemotherapy effortlessly. The duty doctor appeared equally satisfied, as he was coming off and on to just enquire how I was feeling, and looking at my normal response, he said ‘Uncle, you are indeed strong enough’. I just wanted this compliment very much. In any event, it would strengthen and steel my mind - body to squarely face the remaining Chemo cycles.</p>
		<p>Slowly, after two and half hours, the bottle got emptied, and I could see Raju heaving a sigh of relief. He told me “ Daddy, after this it would be again flush Hydration, which is smooth because the liquid for flushing is Aqua. By then, it was early morning 5.30 am. The flush water was going in at almost double the rate, and got over fast<strong>. </strong>I was told to have a wash, and get ready to leave. Vijay came back, and it was decided that we go home after settling the Hospital Bill. We all reached home around 10 am after leaving the HCG Cancer Centre. I was received at the door by our all women family members like a soldier coming from the battle front. Nalu ushered me to my rest room.</p>
		<p>While relaxing thereafter, I was trying to understand if the reactions or side effects of the first chemo would be visible in the days to come. But I subsequently found and noted that I was normal as usual without any sign of the chemo reactions : no hair fall; no nausea; no heartburn; no constipation; surprisingly nothing ! I thought and felt that it was my family Deity / Guru who had protected me from the usual side effects of the first Chemo, and expressed my gratitude to Him. </p>
		<p>I knew that cancer treatment with modern medicine will turn out to be very expensive and exorbitant, while the Hospital bill towards the first cycle of chemotherapy will itself be the indicator. But both Vijay and Raju told me not to worry about the same, and between them they would take care of the treatment cost completely. Vijay went a step further to say that he had got us, i.e., me and wife Nalini covered under his family insurance policy, which enables him to meet a considerable portion of the cancer treatment cost. It was really thoughtful and timely on the part of Vijay to come to my aid in the critical circumstances by having arranged health insurance, for which I cannot adequately thank him. Raju assured that he had arranged for the balance, and I need not bother at all. As Raju had to go back to US because of his work pressure, he excused himself, but assured to come before the treatment got over. </p>
		<p>Incidentally, what I realised and recognised in the diagnosis of my cancer, and the process of seeking treatment and management of the disease, is the mighty care and unflinching support I was getting from my family members. It enabled and strengthened me to tenaciously pursue the battle of cancer. I realised the spontaneous care, intense concern and dedicated support so warm heartedly, caringly and lovingly provided to me by my wife Nalini, son-in-law Vijay, daughter Arati and son Raju at every step or stride, and at every procedure and point, which constituted a critical phase in my fight against cancer. I must say that all the four members of my family truly constituted as my Care Givers, as they are known, in my long battle against the accursed cancer. I am indeed overwhelmed by their love and attachment, besides their unflinching care and concern for me, which has ultimately given me a new lease of life.</p>
		<p><strong>Some Dos and Don’ts, as also preparing to face impact of Chemotherapy cycles on Mind and Body </strong></p>
		<p>After 21 days, we were ready to reach HCG again for the Second Chemo Cycle. Before leaving for HCG, I used to pray God, and hug wife Nalini, not being sure if something untoward were to happen during the process of treatment, I used to get the feeling that each time the hug might be the last one. But I was definitely going with a sense of assurance to face the Chemo Cycle, and come back confidently. </p>
		<p>It was virtual repeat of the routine and round of tests given during the first chemo cycle, excepting for incremental increase in the adriamycin dose volume and concentration. With the administration of the second cycle of chemotherapy, the body reaction was the same as that of the first one. Thereupon, the Medical Oncologist Dr. Radhey Shyam, had prescribed five steroid injections to be taken every day for five days. A nurse would come home and give me these injections.</p>
		<p>In addition, I was advised to take a minimum of 4 litres of water every day. This was needed as the cancer cells crystallize, and have to be pushed out of the system through urination. Willy-nilly, I had to consume this volume of water.</p>
		<p>After 3 days of the second chemo cycle, I observed while taking bath some hair strands from my scalp started falling, though it was not appreciable, I thought that this as clear manifestation of the side effects.</p>
		<p>Dr. Radhey Shyam had also advised me that the chemotherapy drugs would definitely reduce my immunity very much, and I had to take care by not moving out in the crowd or getting exposed to pollution or chemicals. There were, however, mild side reactions like constipation for initial three days after this chemo cycle. I had lost my sense of taste, but I could not reduce my intake of food, as I was taking home cooked food, and I had to remain fit and active. </p>
		<p>Further, as there was deficiency of Vitamin D in me, Dr. Radhey Shyam advised the best way of making up for that would be by exposure to sunlight. I was ensuring that by walking during the morning and after lunch in sunlight every day, Vitamin D is generated in my body. </p>
		<p>Even during the days when I had Chemo, I used to get up every day at 4.30 am, and after freshening up I would start the day with AUM, and do Yoga exercises besides six regular pranayamas without fail. This was helping me physically as well as morally. I had decided to face Cancer and Chemotherapy with full force and determination. But looking at the reactions emerging after 2 cycles of Chemo, I thought I must rise to the occasion, and prepare myself to address this issue. I realised that while undergoing treatment for cancer by Chemotherapy (or for that matter by Surgery / Radiation for others), the patient will have to prepare himself or herself mentally and physically to bear with the excruciating pain and suffering, besides mental agony and distress. </p>
		<p>It is an accepted and settled proposition that Chemotherapy is the mainstay in cancer treatment. To a large extent, Chemotherapy and its side effects or reactions are not known or understood by most of the people. Incidentally, Oncologists neither have time nor inclination to educate or explain to patients or their family about Chemotherapy; how it works, and causes reactions or side effects; answers or response to these, and a host of questions in the minds of the patients, are required. Thus, Chemotherapy has somewhat remained a mystery.</p>
		<p><strong>In Annexure II to this cancer narrative, Chemotherapy modality of treatment is simplified and explained; how it works; what side effects it causes; and how to manage them.</strong></p>

	<section class="level1 unnumbered" epub:type="chapter" role="doc-chapter" id="id-p1.007">
		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 7</span>Facing &amp; overcoming typical side effects or unusual complications during the remaining chemo cycles</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">O</span>n completion of the second Chemo cycle at HCG Cancer Care Centre, Dr. Radhey Shyam reviewed my condition and informed that everything was going as per the plan. He advised me that I have to be careful in meeting many people; I should not go out in the crowd; and I should not allow all sorts of people with any kind of infection to visit or contact me. This was necessary since my immunity level had dropped due to the toxicity of Chemo drugs, and I would be vulnerable to infection faster. Coming out of any infection at this stage would be very tough and time consuming; if any infection were to come midway, then the chemotherapy cycle schedule would get disturbed, which would delay my recovery.</p>
		<p>As my body was responding well, he wanted to maintain the schedule of giving Chemo cycles. He touched my left cheek near the parotid gland, and found that the lump had already vanished by the end of second cycle of chemo. Then, he said that cancer cells may have been killed, dissolved and flushed out of the system with the passing of urine. It was, therefore, worthwhile drinking so much of extra water, and tolerating the pain due to the aggressive Adriamycin.</p>
		<p>I did ask him whether I could resume my regular quota of water, since the Lump had gone, but he advised me to go slow on coming back.</p>
		<p>That the Lump had gone without surgery was indeed a great feeling. However, the Standard Uptake Values (SUV) were not nil, though they were much less when we started, with four Chemo cycles still to go. We came back with the next schedule fixed, and wished to go through the post second chemo period.</p>
		<p>It is during this period, following medical advice, I had to turn away or distance from my grandchildren, who were though preoccupied with their study and school schedules. I was compelled to avoid visitors and even meeting people. Thus, I was virtually isolated, and started feeling lonely except for talking to and hearing my emotional Care Giver, namely, none other than my better half Nalini. No doubt, I used to be occupied with technical work for about six hours during the day. The rest of the time I used to while away seeing and watching happily the kitchen garden, the roads across, the sky and the roof in the house. Then, the thought of engaging myself and remaining occupied prevailed, diverting my mind from the pains, isolation and boredom. </p>
		<p>The day for the third Chemo cycle was approaching, and I felt as though everything was Okay. But when the Blood was tested a day prior to the scheduled Chemo, my Potassium level had gone up. Dr. Radhey Shyam saw the report, and said he can’t go ahead with the chemo procedure, unless the Potassium level came to within normal levels. After a couple of days of controlled diet, we had another run of Blood test. Good riddance, the Potassium level had become normal with my food changes. We were happy about it, as I could go through the third Chemo the next day. This time around, the chemo got over in about six hours. </p>
		<p><strong>Break for Care Givers</strong></p>
		<p>By this time, every Care Giver at home was looking exhausted and drained out due to the strain ofattending to me, both physically and mentally. I thought even Care Givers needed to take care of themselves. The task of taking care of cancer patients is a heavy taxing job, physical as well as mental, apart from entailing postponement and modification of their plans and schedules. They would have to take care of their needs and other requirements, while wanting rest and change from the drudgery of giving continuous attention, service and support to cancer patients. </p>
		<p>It was, therefore, thoughtful of Vijay and Arati to take a few days off during the intervening time between two chemo cycles, to go to the exotic town of Pondicherry, and return by the next chemo cycle schedule. I also felt relieved that it was a welcome change for them. As I was desirous of reading Aurobindo’s philosophy since long, I asked Arati to get some books of Aurobindo, particularly ‘Savitri’ from there. </p>
		<p>So, while Arati and Vijay returned from their brief vacation to Pondicherry duly recharged, I got from her the reading material ‘Savitri’ as a bonus. Meantime, Nalu wanted a break, and went to Dharwad to attend the marriage of her friend’s daughter. I was left with my professional work to be occupied with, while I had the book ‘Savitri’ for my reading. </p>
		<p><strong>Engage in some interesting or absorbing activity to divert attention from the severity of treatment and side effects</strong></p>
		<p>Perhaps I could just sit and worry about the various reactions and side effects that I was going through, but I had decided to keep my regular home office work going on, using my laptop even during my treatment. I got an opportunity to study and design a holder for scrap bookers work. This I did it well, and got the tool developed for making this product and successfully supplied (exported) to United States, which gave me joy and enormous confidence. That reinforced my desire and resolve to manage and come out of my current health condition at the earliest.</p>
		<p>It is against this background, and to divert attention from the severity of treatment I realised that cancer patients like me need to engage in some interesting task or responsibility or lighter pre-occupation cum activity, and possibly creative work. There is nothing like passing time and enjoying TV programmes, serials and debates, painting a canvas, listening to melodious music, designing a new product, and playing with children, watching them swim, play, scream with joy and happiness. </p>
		<p>With no further incidents, one week passed, and Nalu was back to my emotional support, and to give the much needed company. Raju had decided to come to India to enquire about my health, and to be in time for my next chemo. The fourth Chemo Cycle turned out to be exactly the same as the third one, and passed off without hitch or hassle. After this Chemo Cycle, Raju returned to US in view of his job compulsions.</p>
		<p>Then, with the fifth Chemo Cycle approaching, the 21 days in between were rolling without any change. </p>
		<p><strong>Sudden attack of Herpes turns out as a dreadful side effect : but warded off fortuitously, and survived </strong></p>
		<p>One day, as I came back from my evening walk, while Nalu was sitting in the drawing room watching TV. I felt that some bug or insect was crawling on my back. I removed my shirt. and tried to see what was it.</p>
		<p>I told Nalu to see if there was anything crawling on my back. She said there was nothing. But the itching sensation thereat was not going. I applied home cream, and tried to sleep. But throughout the night it was itching very much. The next day when I asked Nalu to see, she said there was some reddish line on my back. I thought it might be some sort of allergy. As the day progressed, things were getting worse. There was some fluid secretion, as my baniyan became yellowish, and the itching becoming severe. I was not able to bear it. </p>
		<p>Next day, we saw Dr. Radhey Shyam, the attending HCG Oncologist, who after seeing the yellow colour on my baniyan, instantaneously said it was Herpes, which happens as a side reaction to Chemo in some persons.</p>
		<p>The attack of  Herpes was both shocking and devastrating, as it  had to be dealt with top most priority, over and above the Chemotherapy treatment, putting the clock back on the progressive management of cancer. Dr. Radhey Shyam said the Chemo cycles can wait till the Herpes is addressed and treated.</p>
		<p>The news hit like a bolt from the blue. This severe reaction or side effect was absolutely unexpected and unanticipated. Obviously, it was a huge setback to the process and progress in the treatment of my cancer. </p>
		<p>I then remembered the Cancer Patient who was crying outside Dr. Radhey Shyam’s Room one day. I also was very much crying aloud. Nalu was totally upset, and Vijay communicated this issue to Raju. And everyone in the house was shell shocked. When things were moving so smoothly, how come this sudden complication ? I knew how Vijay’s late father Srinivasarao Mirji had suffered from Herpes. He almost died then because of it. While compared to cancer, the Herpes attack appeared more serious, and life threatening. Cancer disease though serious, was not contagious, whereas Herpes is. With all the family members in the house, specially the kids around, it was a serious problem and high risk. Till now I was going through the issue of isolation, and now Herpes made me feel what quarantining a person would mean. How much frightening it would be. Dr. Radhey Shyam informed us that till Herpes is treated and got rid off, Chemotherapy treatment will have to be deferred. Strangely, Herpes had upset the Chemo cycle schedule for me.</p>
		<p>The isolation was nerve wrecking. I had even stopped going out for walk. My daily schedule had changed. Every time I took the antibiotics medicine prescribed by Dr. Radhey Shyam for treating my new enemy Herpes, I started taking them, though I knew that allopathy was no real cure for this disease. Thus, using antibiotics was more like a palliative. </p>
		<p>But slowly I decided to gather confidence, and started to think laterally so that I could come out of this alarming situation, and get rid of this Sword of Damocles. Irrespective of the result, I decided to fight.</p>
		<p>Next day I called our Dharwad friend Arvind Kulkarni and requested him to reach the well known Herpes Healer and to get the wondrous powder mix. Accordingly, he got the said Herpes reddish powder mix, and sent to me the same day. He advised me to make paste of the same by mixing it in clean water, and slogging it along the Herpes line.</p>
		<p>I was somewhat relieved to note that there was a ray of hope in this home remedy, and I decided to try it out, as there was no other choice. Moreover, as it was an external application only, I knew it would not interfere with the oral medication prescribed by Dr. Radhey Shyam. I started this application, and continued it for the next three days. And prayed to God to give me some lease of life as a last chance, so that I could go to Dharwad, and have the satisfaction of completing several unfinished tasks and responsibilities to my evolved Savitri, i.e., my better half Nalu, before it becomes late.</p>
		<p>There would be enough time, insofar as my cancer is concerned, for the ultimate to happen, but I did not have any such hope in allopathy, as the treatment otherwise available was just trial and error.</p>
		<p>Eternally grateful to God that my prayers were answered. On the fourth day, the Herpes started drying up, and stopped spreading further. I began getting hope of survival from this dreadful attack of Herpes, not knowing whether this was due to antibiotics, herpes powder mix, my prayers or my Savitri’s Sumangali Yog. Finally, after seven days, there was no burning sensation, no more itching and no further growth. There was ultimately relief in this regard, and I survived from Herpes.</p>
		<p>“Savitri”, the great book by Aurobindo was soothing my mind at times of crisis, and I was believing that anyone who is dying is helpless, but the confidence of Savitri and her likes as my better half Nalu, the key Care Giver has shown, can pull out a dying person from the jaws of death !</p>
		<p>I thought it was right time that I approach Dr. Radhey Shyam, and request him to schedule the remaining two Chemo cycles, and be done with it. </p>
		<p>The fifth Chemo Cycle, as scheduled, was virtually a repeat of the third and fourth cycles without any obstacles. But I would shudder to think of any bout of further reactions before the Sixth Chemo cycle scheduled three weeks from now. Once it is completed, I thought I would get released from this vicious circle of treatment and unforeseen side reactions. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 8</span>The Joy of Conquering Cancer, by finally attaining Complete Remission </h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>t last, we approached the final and sixth Chemo cycle, and I felt good. The same steps envisaged in the Chemotherapy procedure in the last five cycles were routinely followed. Every parameter or level in the test reports was within the normal range. With the blessings of Guru Mantra umbrella, the going of this supposedly last Chemo cycle was smooth. </p>
		<p>Dr. Radhey Shyam came in during the Chemo procedure, and told me that I have responded very well to all the Chemo cycles, and particularly commended my determination to fight, and even take half of the 6 Chemos sitting and reading a book, as against the majority of patients struggling and suffering by crying, shouting and becoming unconscious. Nothing like that happened in my case, and whatever serious side reactions other than the normal I had to face, I did it exceptionally well, as per our Oncologist Dr. Radhey Shyam. I was greatly relieved and delighted. Accordingly, he scheduled a final Pet Scan the next week, and if everything went well, I could return to Dharwad. I felt excited at the thought of going home.</p>
		<p>The following week went off without any problem or issue; the same steroid injections, the same mild constipation for a few days following the chemo, and eating with the wooden tongue without any taste. I was ready to undergo all these, and still gulp the required quantity of nutritious food that Arati prepared without worrying about my taste buds. I took them only with the objective of improving my physical well being.</p>
		<p>After one week we went to HCG for the hopeful last Pet Scan. I was walking briskly as normal, and thought that for the last time I could appreciate the paintings in the Art Gallery, which used to be changed every week. There were fresh murals this time, and abstract expressions.</p>
		<p>We initially got my Muga Scan done, and thereafter the main Pet Scan was arranged this time in a separate Radioactivity Isolated Room, and not at the regular one. Injection of radioactive liquid was given; then one bottle of radioactive Treated Water had to be taken, and I was full. After this, I was waiting in one of the isolation rooms, when I was called as the next patient to take the Pet Scan. I laid down on the Machine, and the scanning was done. Thus, the scanning got over in ten minutes.</p>
		<p>By evening, the Pet Scan report came with a mild shock that the SUV (Standard Uptake Value) at two places was still not within acceptable level, whereas at other three places it was nil. Thereupon, Dr. Radhey Shyam informed me that I had to undergo two more Chemo Cycles, and only after that everything would be clear, and I could be relieved. I was quite upset, but thought there was no way that I could avoid complying with the Doctor’s advice. I felt disappointed and helpless. </p>
		<p>With God’s grace, I reconciled to completing 8 Cycles of Chemotherapy by taking another two Cycles. The Seventh and Eighth Chemo cycles were repetition of the earlier cycles in the normal course, without bringing up different or additional reactions or side effects, except the bare ones.</p>
		<p>And then the final Pet Scan was done on 26th December 2011, with the report being clear, and normal. Finally, the Medical Oncology Team of HCG Cancer Centre declared that day there was complete remission of the cancer in me. I learnt that “complete remission” in cancer meant that no signs or symptoms, and no evidence of cancer can be found on a physical examination by a doctor or through radiological tests. </p>
		<p>For complete remission, some doctors use the terminology “NED” - which stands for “no evidence of disease”. A complete remission may also be described as a “<em>complete response</em>”. Thus, I was happy and relieved with no bounds for my cheer that I had at last conquered or defeated the dreadful cancer. </p>
		<p>I was indeed feeling fine and looking healthy. Did not appear like a cancer affected person, unless told by me. I was happily relieved, having won the battle, and being told that there is no evidence of cancer in me. We then decided to spend time at the HCG cafeteria. Luckily, this time Nalu came to the Hospital, and joined us in the Cafeteria, and also to bid good bye to HCG Cancer Centre, and the Medical Oncology team.</p>
		<p>We were called in by Dr. Radhey Shyam to possibly give us some parting instructions. He gave us a list of several Dos and Don’ts, and asked us to follow them regularly and religiously. Then, he virtually delivered a shock therapy to us. He told us that I should not make the mistake of believing that the treatment is over for good.</p>
		<p>I held my breath, and all of us were waiting for his next announcement. Dr. Radhey Shyam said that I should once in every three months follow up with Rituximab Intravenous Injection, being part of Chemotherapy for the next two years as a preventive measure, and also to ward off any relapse or recurrence possibility. And this post treatment or remission care was going to be at a prohibitive cost of about Rupees twelve lakhs. Reconciling with this mandatory medical requirement, I had to still carry the monkey on my back for a minimum period of two years from my remission, and a maximum period of five years, as that is supposed to be the time or period when I would be declared free from cancer totally. Without having to bother about the preventive action and scenario, I did not want to hold back or contain my feelings of relief, joy and celebration of winning the battle against of cancer. The next day, therefore, was a day of relaxation, and a thanksgiving day. I had to plan our trip back to Dharwad, though tinged with mixed feelings. </p>
		<p>Firstly, I owe my deepest gratitude to our family deity Halaganesha and my revered Guru Raghavendra Swamy for having blessed me with a new lease of life, upon total remission of my cancer.</p>
		<p>Secondly, I remain ever grateful to all my Care Givers, namely, wife Nalini, son-in-law Vijay, daughter Arati and son Raju for supporting and propping me up all the while, in addition to serving, aiding, arranging and rendering miscellaneous help to me. And naturally sacrificing their time, comfort, priorities and personal conveniences, from the stage of my cancer diagnosis to cancer remission. Of course, I owe a lot to my better half Nalu, who evolved as my Savitri, and stood with me like a rock and shadow, giving me unflinching emotional strength and support, as well as giving me life insurance. That gave me the belief that as long she was around me, I will fight and defeat cancer, without letting anything otherwise to happen.</p>
		<p>We decided to have a good party time outside in the evening, and went to Taj Vivanta at MG Road. It was relief, joy and celebration for all of us, We were all happy, had good dinner, while I followed dietary restrictions right from the first freedom day.</p>
		<p>The next day was going to be the last day of our stay in Bangalore. We were to leave for Dharwad by the night train, but decided to leave Arati’s house in the morning, and go about meeting all our close relatives, who had been part of the family support group and well wishers in my cancer battle. It was thus a thanksgiving day, and farewell meeting with family connections in Bangalore, ie., sister-in-law Nanda, sister Prema, sister-in-law Sudha and co-brother Dinesh Prathinidhi at their respective houses.</p>
		<p>After meeting all of them, and bidding them bye, we left for Dharwad by Train that late evening, and reached Dharwad the following morning. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 9</span>Key Contributory Factors for Combating and Managing Cancer with Conventional Medicine, as the MANTRA</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he real fight against cancer, with its overall treatment and management, begins with pursuit of an action plan and preparedness by the cancer patient physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Listed here below are the Key Contributory Factors, constituting the Mantra for combating and managing cancer :</p>
		<p><strong>1. The Oncologist</strong></p>
		<p>The Doctor, i.e., the Oncologist, is the most important and key resource support structure as a qualified medical professional specialised in Cancer. Being in charge of treating and managing cancer of the patient, the Oncologist is uniquely placed to do all that is required for observing, recognising and assessing the cancer status of the patient. Then, he would finalise treatment plan for the cancer condition, and its spread, if any, to begin with, and to thereafter modify or continue the treatment plan. The Oncologist will particularly decide the protocol and chemotherapy drugs, providing the right medication and related issues with regard to the side effects of Chemotherapy, besides augmenting them with additional or adjuvant procedures, medicines, etc. </p>
		<p>Of course, the attending Medical Oncologist has to be experienced and effective, duly assisted by a good paramedical team. Choice of the Hospital and the Oncologist would already have been decided at the beginning of the treatment, and there will hardly be any situation or possibility of changing the assigned Oncologist. Apart from general counselling on overall health, he would advise on a number of dos and don’ts to the patient for alleviation and relief in the event of reactions and side effects, as a result of administering Chemotherapy or any other modality of treatment.</p>
		<p><strong>2. The Patient</strong></p>
		<p>The most important person in the scheme of cancer management is none other than the cancer patient. Thus, managing and neutralising cancer depend to a large extent on the patient itself. The patient, therefore, must be willing and ready to take and accept the treatment given in the first place; secondly, and more importantly, as cancer treatment is a long drawn process, and consumes considerable time, the treatment becomes highly expensive. Cancer treatment by itself is not insurable, and it is normally not subsidised by private Hospitals or any other institution or body. Cancer drug manufacturers, however, do subsidise the cost of drugs to the patients through Hospitals, but it hardly reaches them. Invariably, the patients are supposed to come for treatment at their own cost, or mobilise it from their sources. </p>
		<p>Apart from being prepared and ready to manage these two essential requirements, the patient needs to be or become firm and decisive, if not being strong willed; must muster courage and strength to bear with or tolerate the pains and setbacks, the reactions and side effects during the treatment and after; to face challenges and, overcoming fears and frustrations, etc. and ultimately show grit and determination to win the battle. They would do well to remember that strength does not come from physical capacity; it comes from an indomitable will, as said by Mahatma Gandhi. The body may not be ready or willing, but if the patient wills and makes up his mind, he/she can prompt and direct the body to persist, and move on by being or becoming ready to fight the cancer battle. In the ultimate analysis, the cancer patient will be enabled to, and will have to, pursue and achieve the goal of defeating cancer. </p>
		<p><strong>3. Will &amp; Will Power</strong></p>
		<p>Will is related to desire. If you do not want something very much, then the will to succeed is likely to be weak. On the other hand, if you have a strong desire, then you are more likely to persist. What ‘Will’ is capable of doing is virtually expressed in the proverbial saying : “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”. </p>
		<p>Will Power is the motivation to exercise will. A strong willed person is able to take decisions even in the face of strong opposition or adverse circumstances. A person with lesser or little will power will give in easily. Getting what you want takes will power, whether it means you are doing something or others are doing things for you. To succeed, you must first know what you want. Then, you must be determined to get it, even in the face of extreme difficulties. Resolve and determination to fight the battle against cancer take shape in the form of Will and Will Power for the patient. As such, a cancer patient must have or would have to develop strong desire and determination to fight; it then manifests as will power to eventually overcome and win the battle against cancer. </p>
		<p>One of the classic cases of what ‘will power’ or for that matter power of mind’ can do, despite the body suffering from acute and intolerable pain, is that of Arunima Sinha, a Mountain Climber. She is a former national level volleyball player, who was thrown out of a running train in 2011. In order to save her life, doctors had to amputate part of her left leg. This did not stop her from dreaming the impossible. In the light of this event, Arunima became inspired by Yuvraj Singh, the great cricket player, who successfully won his cancer battle. She thus willed, and was determined to climb the mountains. In 2013, Arunima, became the first female amputee (and the first Indian amputee) to climb Mt. Everest, when she was just 25 years old. She then went on to climb Mt. Elbrus in Europe and Mt. Kilamanjaro in Africa. In her INK Talk at Mumbai in 2014, she attributed her mountain climbing accomplishment solely to the power of her mind, which enabled her body to move on and climb Mount Everest despite physical disability, sluggish body and highest risks to her life.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Spirituality </strong></p>
		<p>One of the foremost Tibetan Doctors, Dr. Yeshi Dhonden, a Buddhist Monk, who has treated thousands of cancer patients from all over the world, has this to say on Spirituality : </p>
		<p>Spirituality always plays a bigger role in one’s healthy life and even influences end-of-life decisions. It is defined as how one can connect to their sacred God. It is the awareness of something greater than the individual self. It can be understood as one’s relationship with their soul, expressed through one’s attitudes, postures and practices. Spirituality can be understood as the inner life of a person. The deeper you go spiritually, the stronger the patients can go on in fighting serious ailments and diseases. During the treatment, they can find the meaning of peace and wellness despite fatigue or pain. </p>
		<p>Patients with cancer who had high levels of spiritual well-being reported more enjoyment in life, and higher levels of meaning and peace, even in the midst of cancer-related symptoms such as fatigue or pain. Cancer patients report that their spirituality helps them find hope, gratitude and positivity in their experience, and that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope with life, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of cancer experience as they recover from treatment. One of the greatest gifts of spirituality is learning to love, and fully accepting yourself and others in the present moment. Cancer healing leads to higher feelings of personal growth.</p>
		<p>Spirituality can take many forms, and is unique to each individual. Spiritual practices that may help in coping with cancer and its treatments include:</p>
		<p>1. Taking time off regularly to meditate or pray; 2. Reading spiritual writings and works; 3. Retreating to spiritual places and natural settings; 4. Spending time with monks and spiritual persons; 5. Chanting a mantra repeatedly as one of the ways to reach spirituality; 6. Listening to classical and spiritual music; 7. Performing yoga asanas in a proper manner helps to avoid depression; 8. Talking and discussing spiritual matters with others. </p>
		<p>Holistic practitioners say that spiritual or religious practices can help you adjust to the effects as well as side effects of cancer and its treatment. Patients who rely on their faith tend to experience increased hope and optimism, freedom from regret, higher satisfaction with life, and feelings of inner peace. Spirituality may also reduce anxiety, anger and discomfort.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Yoga </strong></p>
		<p>Originated in ancient India, Yoga typically means ‘union’ between the mind, body and spirit. It involves the practice of physical postures and poses, referred to as ‘asana’ in Sanskrit. As the name suggests, the ultimate aim of practising Yoga is to create a balance between the body and the mind, and to attain self enlightenment. In order to accomplish it, Yoga makes use of asanas, breathing exercises, relaxation techniques and meditation. It brings about emotional stability and clarity of mind. </p>
		<p>Some do yoga recreationally, some do it as a form of exercise, some do it to relax, and some do it as a complementary therapy for cancer. Most of the people diagnosed with cancer opt for Yoga after the treatment. They may not know or be told that Yoga can be practised right from the time of diagnosis. </p>
		<p><strong>Yoga recognised and effective as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Yoga is designed to support conventional medical treatment of cancer patients by helping them to manage side effects, both mental and physical. Cancer can cause immense stress and distress to a person. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy usually cause heavy physical side effects. The practice of gentle yoga postures helps strengthen the muscles and joints, thus relieving stress and fatigue. Relief from this condition of stress, along with specific yogic exercises generate positive energy, thus creating a balance between the mind and the body. </p>
		<p>Used as an adjunct therapy in managing cancer, yoga helps in effectively clearing out toxins accrued. Yoga asanas stimulate not just muscles, but also increases blood flow, balances the glands and enhances the lymphatic flow in the body, all of which enhances the body’s internal purification processes. The deep, relaxing breathing often emphasized in yoga also increases the current of oxygen-rich blood to the cells, delivering vital nutrients to tired cells. </p>
		<p><strong>When can one do Yoga ?</strong></p>
		<p>It is preferable and advisable that cancer patients do Yoga right from the time of diagnosis. Yoga can be done at all stages of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Whatever Yoga asanas and techniques that cancer patients would have to do or practise has to be invariably done under the guidance of a Yoga Practitioner.</p>
		<p><em>Pre treatment :</em></p>
		<p>‘Fear’ is a common factor faced by almost all patients before treatment. Although a patient requires some time to overcome fear, the anxiety associated with fear can be reduced by doing deep breathing practices before chemotherapy / radiation / surgery. </p>
		<p><em>During treatment :</em></p>
		<p>While the treatment is going on, a patient may be disturbed by thoughts about reactions and side effects; his / her future, finance, career or the family. Patients would have to divert their minds from these disturbing thoughts by performing deep breathing exercises while undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. </p>
		<p><em>Post treatment :</em></p>
		<p>Going through cancer treatment may not be easy, and it will take some time for an individual to recoup post treatment. Then, the ‘fear’ of cancer recurrence is always there. This is also a form of stress. But once the treatment is over, the patient will be able to do more Yoga practices. While deep breathing exercises help to relax the mind by reducing stress, Yoga Nidra helps to remove the deep-rooted fear. Once the stress begins to reduce, the patient starts feeling positive. Low immunity is one of the causes of cancer, and Yoga is known to improve the immune system. </p>
		<p><strong>6. Care Giver </strong></p>
		<p>Care Giver is a familiar face with, and among cancer patients. Care Givers are usually a part of cancer patient’s family, who is available at his / her beck and call. The functional responsibilities of a Care Giver is to help, aid and assist the cancer affected relative in his / her treatment modality, co-ordinating with doctors and para medical staff for consultation and carrying out instructions; organising prescribed medicines; arranging recommended medical tests and procedures; apart from ensuring medicinal intake, food and personal requirements of the patient, with dedication, love and tender care. Many times, the Care Givers are the lifeline of cancer patients. Care Givers have many roles. These roles change as the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment.</p>
		<p>Family Care Givers provide a complex array of support tasks that extend across physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional domains. Generally speaking, more women than men become Care Givers, and most Care Givers are related to the person who has cancer. Family caregivers play an important role in the treatment of cancer of their people / patients; hence enlisting their co-operation and including them as the unit of care from the outset are considered critical ingredients to cancer management. </p>
		<p>The role of Care Givers is very important. It is certainly not less than that of the attending Doctors. A Care Giver is so chosen, or one who has willingly and spontaneously agreed to be a person, who is going to be with the Patient throughout the treatment period, and post treatment preventive care.</p>
		<p>As Care Givers, they have a huge influence – both positive and negative – on how the cancer patient deals with his / her illness. Hence, their encouragement can help the patient stick to a demanding treatment plan and take other steps to get well, like eating healthy meals or getting enough rest. The Care Giver is part of a cancer care team made up of the patient, other family and friends, and the medical staff. Care Givers are problem solvers. The person with cancer faces many new challenges. Care Givers help the patient deal with their challenges, and get through any problems they face. </p>
		<div class="inlay">
		<p class="myquote">
			<strong>Tailpiece</strong><br />
			<em>Caregivers’ care, concern, reliable and soothing support to their cancer patients will have to extend not only beyond treatment period and remission, but even after becoming totally free from the cancer disease. This is so because patients invariably feel the stamp of cancer on them is permanent, and for the rest of life.</em><br />
			<em>‘Once a Cancerwala, always a Cancerwala’ is what the people and the society say. A cancer affected person becomes a Cancer Patient during treatment; a Cancer Victim if one succumbs to the disease; a Cancer Survivor, if one wins the cancer battle, leading a normal life, writes or publishes his / her cancer battle; and finally a Cancer Fighter if he / she lives long enough after remission to encounter any second life threatening conditions. </em>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 10</span>Paying obeisance and expressing eternal gratitude to the Family Deity &amp; Guru for new lease of life and preventive care </h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">R</span>eturning to Dharwad after my successful treatment of cancer at HCG Cancer Specialist Centre, Bangalore after about 8 months turned out to be a matter of relief, joy and triumph. We were back at our home “Aashraya”, where I had almost said “Adieu”, but in the heart of hearts, I had the confidence to transform it into “Au revoir”. It was indeed a wonderful feeling we had on our homecoming. The satisfaction of settling down with peace and restored health was sinking in. Before embarking on the plan of post remission care, I wanted to first express my gratitude and pay my obeisance to the unseen hand of our family deity Kuladevata Halaganesha, who had supported and protected me throughout my cancer battle and ensured my safety. The least I could do was to go to Halagani village and invoke all other Gods there, and pray by presenting ourselves. We visited Halagani along with our relatives, who had prayed for my well being.</p>
		<p>The Pooja at the Halaganesha Temple on the day we reached Halagani was conducted with the whole village being invited to the Prasadam, as it was done for our Kulkarni family of Bableshwar. I was asked to enter into the sanctum sanctorum of the temple and sit over there, which I could not due to chronic back pain, but managed to crawl inside, and join all others squatting down for the special prayer. The Pooja was over after two hours, and I was the first to crawl back from the sanctum sanctorum, without any problem. Everyone was stunned, and so was I equally, but pleasantly surprised to see that I not only crawled and came out, but I could stand up easily, without anyone’s help despite my physical difficulty. </p>
		<p>This was the first proof of the faith and belief in the energy that was emanating from the sanctum sanctorum. I slowly bowed down and knelt in front of the door to the sanctum sanctorum from where I could see the idol of Halaganesha. </p>
		<p>As for offering obeisance and gratefulness to Guru Raghavendra Swamy, instead of doing so by going to Mantralaya, I went to the Raghavendra Swamy Mutt located at Malmaddi in Dharwad. It gave me a sense of relief and peace, while I prayed and received blessings.</p>
		<p>While I was in the course of complete remission in my cancer, I noted that Oncologists and associated Doctors were saying that relapse of cancer is a side effect of the main Chemo, which every cancer survivor has to face or fight with. Thus, cancer survivors have to initially go through a state of anxiety and uncertainty as a follow up measure during the first two years, and subsequently for a period of three years, till the total post treatment period of five years is over. I accordingly decided to muster my energy to cross this line. Thus, I resolved to reach this goal post of being a cancer fighter, howsoever, difficult it may be. </p>
		<p>I thought of the parting instructions given by HCG Oncologist Dr. Radhey Shyam in this context. He had very clearly told us that his responsibility extended beyond the eighth Chemo cycle, and had advised me to take eight more Chemo cycles of Rituximab, one in every 3 months. More particularly, he had told us about the risks and dangers of not doing the follow up Chemotherapy cycles. According to him, some of the patients, who are drained out by the time they complete the recommended Chemotherapy Cycles of treatment, would, or at the most, take a few more Chemo cycles of the prescribed follow up programme, and leave half way through. This could be either because of strain or drain on their finances, or perhaps due to their over confidence. And such patients are prone or vulnerable to relapse; and hence he had advised me not to leave the follow up plan midway. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 11</span>Moving on, pursuing and embracing new life, post remission </h1>
		<p>It is well known and accepted that cancer is a life changing event, and perhaps a phenomenon to the survivors. By emerging out of the Hospital as a cancer battle winner becomes a high point in life of cancer patients.</p>
		<p>Once all the tests are cleared by cancer survivors, the real challenge starts. Because of cancer, their entire life is turned off, and they have to now pick up the threads again, having attained complete remission. Whatever medical treatment is recommended as follow up or preventive care is just 25 % of the part of their life that has to be taken care of. But the remaining part such as regular diet and food intake, schedule of work and plan of activities for being fit and active, would undergo a change. Their personality and outlook get changed because of the cancer effect.</p>
		<p>The cancer survivors will have to reset their bio-clock from what it was before. Their wake up time, morning schedules like exercises meditation, yoga and walking would have to change. Looking at life would also change. One may become mellowed, philosophical, spiritual and religious in life, having undergone an unparalleled event, which is no different from the trauma or chill of a near death experience. Hence, the need is to move on, and embrace the new life ahead. </p>
		<p>Thus, the question or challenge before me was how to be active and remain occupied apart from the compulsions of resetting my bio-clock and rescheduling my activities and work, which cancer survivors are usually confronted with. I thought of planning and doing things, activities and work of my choice and liking, while doing my professional work cum business to a limited extent, besides pursuing my drawing and painting hobbies. All these activities being volitional and of a honorary nature, would be at my terms without expecting anything, but giving me a sense of satisfaction, and away from the post cancer remission mundane.</p>
		<p>Among several activities and proposals that came to my mind, I hit upon the thought of firstly developing guidelines for aftercare of cancer survivors, and secondly, pursuing a plan of travelling and visiting tourist places and shrines during this period.</p>
		<p><strong>Opportunity of sharing Story of Winning Cancer Battle at a National Seminar</strong></p>
		<p>Coincidently, one of the earliest opportunities I got to come out during the post remission period was of sharing my story of fighting and winning the cancer battle at a National Seminar on Management of Cancer. This professional event was organised by Indian Society of Health Administrators, with my friend and colleague J.S. Pant, as a Seminar Co-ordinator. It was held on 23rd September 2012 at the Taj Vivanta Hotel, Bangalore. I was invited to the Seminar along with three other cancer battle winners to narrate our success stories. The objective of bringing cancer battle winners on the stage was not only to enable delegates to appreciate the saga and triumph of cancer patients in their battle against the disease, but to felicitate and honour them for their inspiring example.</p>
		<p>I was indeed overwhelmed to be one of the four honoured cancer battle winners at this all India professional event ; the other three being Dr. Keerti Tewari, a Medical Doctor and Civil Servant ; Mr. V. Amar Bhaskar, a top executive with IBM ; and Mr. Shiva Kumar, an Advocate and Consultant ; with all of them being from Bangalore. It gave me a degree or sense of satisfaction, recognition and elation for sharing my story of winning battle against cancer at a national seminar.</p>
		<p>Back in Dharwad, I started looking for some good Doctor for my follow up of preventive care consisting of eight Rituximab IV Injections that I had to take for the next two years ; that is four per year, with one in every three months. There is a Cancer Hospital at Dharwad, where most cancer patients in and around Dharwad come for treatment. It is attached to the Karnataka Govt. Cancer Research Institute, situated at Navanagar, Hubli. We met a senior Oncologist in Dr. A.C. Deka at this Hospital, who examined me, and agreed to have the post treatment preventive care with Chemo cycles duly and effectively arranged. </p>
		<p>We then came to know that a visiting Medical Oncologist to this Hospital was Dr. Kiran Kattimani, who had earlier worked with HCG Cancer Centre at Bangalore, and knew Dr. Jagannath Dixit as well as Dr. Radhey Shyam well enough, and I thought there will be some kind of continuity in my follow up treatment. As Dr. Kattimani had wide experience of attending to cancer survivors personally and effectively, I decided to go with him for my preventive care.</p>
		<p>Dr. Kiran Kattimani was known to administer the IV Rituximab Chemo to his patients at Sushruta Hospital, Hubli to which he was attached. The Chemo preventive care was going to take about 3 to 4 hours for each session. Here too, I used to take Chemo for three hours sitting only, because I did not like being seen as sick, when I was fit and healthy. Dr. Kattimani was helpful and considerate ; he even saw to it that patients are not burdened with avoidable medicines and procedures. By the way, he got the incentivised discount on Rituximab injections for me.</p>
		<p>During one of the eight follow up Chemo cycles, I was sitting on the chair by the side of a bed at Sushruta Hospital, with the Rituximab Chemo trickling drop by drop in my body, and I was reading my favorite Book, “Savitri” by Aurobindo. At that time, Dr. Kattimani happened to drop in. Even before he could say anything, I asked him impulsively, ‘How are you Doctor ?’ Dr. Kattimani burst into laughter, and said, “This is the first time in my life as a doctor, that a patient is asking me how I am, whereas I came here to attend our patient”. He further said : “Looking at your spirits, I feel the monkey on your back has run away long back, and you do not have to worry about your shoulders”. </p>
		<p>Incidentally, and as God willed, I completed the 8th follow up Rituximab IVs successfully within two years of my attaining remission, without any kind of side effects or reactions. Once, all the preventive Chemo Cycles were over, I was advised to take a PET Scan. The PET Scan showed no presence of any malignancy, and the SUVs at all points were nil. Thus, both Dr. Deka and Dr. Kattimani were very pleased and happy about my health status. They advised me that after this virtual final Test, I had to get myself tested once in six months only, till I complete the period of five years from remission. With this, the second phase of treatment was over, and I entered into the third and final Observation Phase.</p>
		<p><strong>Guidelines for Aftercare of Cancer Survivors </strong></p>
		<p>Simultaneously, I began identifying, studying and trying out the different as well as the unexplored or less known modalities of containing and overcoming cancer from among the alternative medicines or holistic science. I found that there are good options in the complementary and alternative medicines, which contribute to preventing relapse or recurrence of cancer of different types. From the ones available, and that I heard of, I studied, tested and used them, I experienced the salutary and positive effect they had on me, as a cancer survivor. I found out, realised and noted that a cancer survivor opting for alternative medicines, would have to change and accept four critical paths or areas for maintaining health and remaining free from, or unaffected by, cancer. These are :</p>
		<p><strong>1. Food Habits :</strong></p>
		<p>One has to select the food, the fruits and the greens that give added strength, immunity, blood chemistry enhancement and add the much required Laetrile / Amygdalin element in the body bio to enable you to fight recurrence or relapse of cancer.</p>
		<p>The following should be generally part of cancer survivor’s food palette :</p>
		<p>1. All types of Millet Foods </p>
		<p>2. Fruits generally having pulp in yellow, orange or red in colour</p>
		<p>3. Green vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, berries and guava to be taken. </p>
		<p><strong>2. Herbal Support :</strong></p>
		<p>Once the conventional treatment is over, cancer survivors need herbal  nutritional support for improvement in the following areas :</p>
		<p>Blood Quality improvement : With the Hb % and CBC chart having become poor immediately after the conventional treatment, sufficient attention is required to be given for improving the Hb percentage and platelet count.</p>
		<p>To attain these results, the cancer survivors need to take:</p>
		<p>150 ml of Wheat Grass Juice in the morning on empty stomach</p>
		<p>Crush 5 Neem Leaves, 5 Tulsi (Black Basil) Leaves and 5 Bel leaves, and gulp them early in the morning.</p>
		<p>Along with the above two herbal intake, one has to take herbal Kashaya of Simarouba Glucain the morning </p>
		<p>Make it a regular daily habit to Chew 7/8 Apricot Seeds / Apple Seeds / Papaya Seeds before breakfast, afternoon lunch and evening dinner. (Apricot Kernels, Apple Seeds, Berry Seeds, Papaya Seeds contain higher quantity of Laetrile) </p>
		<p>Adapting and getting used to these food habits would facilitate in improving blood chemistry, enhancement of immunity, developing appetite, in addition to providing the much needed antibiotics to fight infections.</p>
		<p>Apart from the above, add the following items to your daily schedule:</p>
		<p>a) Take one teaspoon of Honey + ½ teaspoon of baking soda (mixed  well) every day before going to bed. This will augment the alkalizing   effect to your blood Ph, which should be above 7 and below 9. </p>
		<p>b) Take 2 dates before going to bed. This will enable you to maintain  high levels of Hb, and act as good sleep inducing agent.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Change Bio Clock :</strong></p>
		<p>This is best done by tuning your Bio Clock to synchronize with optimum levels of availability of : </p>
		<p>a) Oxygen in the atmosphere</p>
		<p>b) Exposure to sunlight for increasing Vitamin D level in your system.</p>
		<p>It is relevant to note that air in the atmosphere contains 40 % more of oxygen between 4. 00 am and 6.00 am early morning.</p>
		<p>Nature Walking at the above time interval would facilitate physical exercise, relaxation to mind and higher levels of oxygen in the blood circulation system.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Meditation :</strong></p>
		<p>After the morning walk for about one hour, select a silent and peaceful place in your house, and do any type of meditation for about 20 minutes.</p>
		<p><strong>Welcome Change by travelling to Tourist Places and Pilgrim Centres, starting with Visit to Vaishnodevi Shrine </strong></p>
		<p>In the first quarter after the Chemotherapy treatment was over, my brother Jayakumar and I along with our spouses decided to visit the Vaishnodevi shrine. It was rainy season, but we were keen to be there in the Himalayas to visit the Devi Temple, and enjoy the rain in the hills. </p>
		<p>We took flight from Mumbai to Delhi, and onward to Jammu via Srinagar.. From Jammu we reached Katra by Taxi, and stayed overnight at a Hotel there. Next day early morning we decided to climb the hill with the help of Pallaki Carriers. Intermittently, we went by foot, and the journey became enjoyable, with rain and cold wind, which added to the thrill. After having Darshan, we returned to Katra base Hotel, and decided to visit some more places the next morning. </p>
		<p>We went to a place called Dhansar Baba Cave. Initially, I thought I could not reach this place. From the Hilltop where we were, we could not even see the cave; but when we enquired with a shopkeeper there, we were told that the cave was just about 12 steps down the slope. We decided to climb down, but as we proceeded we found that we had to cover 225 steps to reach the cave, which was just above the bank of river Tavi. </p>
		<p>Initially, Jayakumar told me to rest half way, and he would go down and return. But I decided to take the test, and see the cave, nothing could stop me. We ultimately climbed down. It was worth the effort; there was a small waterfall where ice was gradually melting, with droplets falling on the Shivalinga below. This was happening for ages non-stop. A wonderful sight. I said Jai Cancer Baba ! And started climbing to the top. Believe it or not, I was the first to reach the top. So much for my determination and endurance. I must say it was a wonderful feeling of having truly won the race with the monkey on my back, at my 70 plus age. </p>
		<p>This outing definitely helped me to have a welcome change from the thought of cancer care all the time.</p>
		<p>As cancer survivors, we must enlarge, escalate and extend our activities as well as involvements in several areas and things other than the routine, which definitely would help in preventing any possibility of cancer making a comeback. Mind remains fresh and positive as long as you engage it in new things, new places and new activities.</p>
		<p>Our journey continued and we were at Jammu for two days. Visited most of the temples and historical places.</p>
		<p>When I found that the travel and tour programme helped me in diverting my mind from the tenacious fight against cancer post remission, and opening of fresh windows to do so many good things in life, I decided to have such touring and travelling on an ongoing basis for the period of five years after my cancer remission. </p>
		<p>Our next outing or tour was to the Gir Forests in Gujarat, and visit to Dwarkanath Temple at Dwaraka. We stayed at Mahindra Holiday Homes during our Gir visit, and enjoyed the complete visit inside the forest to have a first glimpse of the Gir Lions roaming free in the open.</p>
		<p>Dwaraka visit was a religious tempered one. We visited Dwaraka and the surrounding places. </p>
		<p>Porbunder was another location which we covered, where we saw the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi. Within striking distance thereof, we visited the enchanting places Sudama Temple and Sandeepani Ashram, where we had real quality time out.</p>
		<p>Thus, the second visit further reinforced my belief that such tours not only enlarge our horizons, but help in relaxing, which have a direct impact on our mind for being more positive, and less stressed.</p>
		<p>This programme was followed by our trip to Sri Lanka. It was for seven days of relaxation and education. The Buddhist culture impressed us so much when we saw the relics of Buddha in the Buddha Temple.</p>
		<p>The place where Sita was kept as a prisoner, the Ashok Vana and the Hanuman Temple were all enchanting.</p>
		<p>Our next visit was to Mauritius, where we had lot of watersports to enjoy. Attention to cleanliness and hygiene on the one hand, whereas according primacy and priority to education did impress us very much. Similar was our exciting and exhilarating experience in our trips to other north eastern Asian countries Bali and Malaysia. </p>
		<p>The main purpose of stressing that cancer survivors have to tour and travel is to enable them to fly free and enjoy; turn it into positivity; and bring them closer to spiritualism. Then, one will be successful in joining the mind and the body, since coordination of mind and body is very important in fighting any type of inner enemy. </p>
		<p>Researchers have linked positive emotions, especially the awe we feel when touched by the beauty of nature, art and spirituality - to lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, which are proteins that signal the immune system to work harder.</p>
		<p>I had decided to travel around the world; enjoy and celebrate life as much as possible during the course of my five year marathon period for finally emerging as being totally free from cancer. At every stage I had to ensure that the defeated cancer in me remained tired, weak and disabled. The complementary and alternative medicines as well as their methods helped me a lot in enhancing my endurance. I was constantly on the move, as I wanted to cover more and more places and locations, thereby seeing and enjoying much much more. </p>
		<p>During the earlier part of our marathon journey in a little over four years after attaining complete remission, we covered the Himalayan region, Vaishno Devi, Dhansar Baba, Gir Forest, Dwaraka, Porbunder, and finally visited Srilanka, Mauritius, Bali and Malaysia. And to make sure that my health condition was good enough, I used to get myself checked twice in a year. I found that my Blood Tests, X Ray, Ultrasonography and at times PET Scans were well within the normal range. </p>
		<p>Our visit to South Africa and Kenya was the extreme test of my planned preparedness and immunity cum endurance levels at one shot. I decided to visit South Africa as also the neighbouring Kenya, taking a much longer journey comprising almost 28 hours of flight time between Mumbai and Port Elizabeth via Nairobi and Johannesburg ! We reached Port Elizabeth after a very long and tiresome journey, but yet ready to take up more. The same evening we had to visit the Port before retiring. The next part of our programme was visiting Blaukrans Bridge, where we had the excitement of doing bungee jump of 220 meter deep down the valley. </p>
		<p>The most challenging event was still to come. The Congo Caves of six halls covered approximately 650 steps. Our Guide and my brother looked at me in stark disbelief, and wondering whether I would prefer to wait down the hill till they finished the visit. But my mind was not willing to this proposition. Neither wanted to go back, nor gave up, I decided to submit myself to the test and challenge. I wanted to climb and visit all the six halls of Congo Caves.</p>
		<p>I remember during the previous visits, I had tested my body endurance by climbing 250 steps at Dhansar in the Himalayas, and 300 steps at Malaysia. Now I raised the level to 650 steps to beat my earlier records. It was no doubt tough and challenging. </p>
		<p>Thrilling experience. With God’s grace, I completed the climb, and visited the six halls of the caves with all others. The act of climbing down had left my guide exclaiming that hardly anybody of my age dares to do it.</p>
		<p>The next course of our action plan was a real surprise and unbelievable : befriending the wildest. Not even the dreaded cancer can be as dangerous and frightening. Instead of describing the live thrill, I would prefer my unusual speaking photo, caressing the wildest of the wild animals in the collections  at the end of this Part:One of this book.</p>
		<p>Our next outing was more dangerous, but full of thrill and challenge. This was Masai Mara National Park, where we spent four days in the deep jungle amidst wild life. Daily morning we started by 5 am, and would be on the move till 7 pm taking many rounds of the forest hundreds of kilometers in search of wildlife --- African Elephants, Zebras in thousands, Giraffes, Lions, Leopards, Wild Bisons, Rhinos and much much more. Life for us was on the wire during those breathtaking and wondrous moments..</p>
		<p>We returned to our pavilion at Dharwad after completing the marathon, with the last lap of our tour being amidst the wildlife in South Africa and Kenya. I got a total health check up done along with the recommended lab tests as advised by our family doctor, which showed me in the best of health and renewed vigour. Hip, hip, hurrah ! </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 12</span>Transformative Journey of Cancer Battle Winner to Guiding Others in Containing and Managing Cancer, with <em>Hopestar</em> MANTRA, supported by illustrative cases </h1>
		<p>I must say the cancer in me has taught some lessons. For, I went through the trials and tribulations as a cancer patient under conventional or mainstream medicine; took the crucial Chemotherapy treatment, and ultimately attained complete remission. However, I silently and helplessly faced and experienced the devastating impact of cancer treatment on my health and condition physically, mentally and financially. Then, I had to come to terms with the cumulative side effects of Chemotherapy. </p>
		<p>While conventional medicine attempts to treat and address cancer, the treatment by itself does not offer or assure of cure or lasting solution, but at best it would be complete remission. However, it comes with a caveat : aftercare and preventive treatment are absolutely necessary, without which there is a probability of relapse or recurrence of cancer. Thus, the question of cancer patients becoming totally free from the dreaded disease has remained academic or surreal. In such a scenario, the expression or word ‘cure’ may not be appropriate or forthcoming with respect to cancer. At best, as Oncologists say, cancer can be managed or controlled.</p>
		<p>Even in my case, it was said that since my prognosis was good, I stood good chance of coming under the category of manageable cases. If the treatment modality or method works, the relief or recovery is a distinct possibility. Otherwise, the system gives up, and the patient will not know where to go. This apart, conventional or mainstream treatment is neither affordable nor acceptable to large sections of the society, particularly the poor, the indigent and the lower middle class. Only those who can afford, or who are covered by hefty insurance, or opt for Govt. health schemes or subsidy from social organisations go in for conventional treatment. But what happens to the rest - the large majority of the poor and lower middle class, who will even find it hard to meet the costs of cancer diagnostic tests. Thus today, only those who cannot afford or those who have been turned away by Cancer Hospitals with conventional medicine approach complementary and alternative medicines. </p>
		<p>Against this background and scenario, I embarked on the journey of exploring, learning and pursuing the complementary, alternative and integrative medicines or modalities of treatment for addressing and fighting cancer at low or affordable cost, and without having to suffer the collateral damage that is usually associated with conventional medicine. In my relentless search and quest for an option or alternative modality to conventional medicine for fighting and managing cancer, I found more and more people affected with cancer willing to look for affordable or optional treatment modalities, which do not cause collateral damage to the human body and mind. </p>

		<p>The seeds for the birth of <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra were sown during my cancer treatment, and materialised post remission and thereafter. I found out, observed and realised that complementary and alternative system of medicines provided an effective, affordable and better option or solution for combating and managing cancer of different types, without causing collateral damage. Thus I strenuously pursued, tried and explored the combination of various steps and processes, including specific protocols of herbal medicines and healing foods, which would eventually alleviate the cancer condition and pain in the patients. </p>
		<p><strong>Now, as Hony. Cancer Guide (HCG), helping people to contain and manage cancer with <em>Hopestar </em>MANTRA</strong></p>
		<p>It has since been a turning point in my cancer saga and journey. I have finally succeeded in formulating a recipe or solution to containing and managing cancer with <em>Hopestar</em> as the Mantra. This simple mantra called <em>Hopestar</em> MANTRA describes the steps, processes and protocols envisaged therein, which have been applied, tested and tried on a number of cancer patients with favourable outcome and results. It addresses and neutralises the side effects and reactions. Simply affordable. Worth trying, testing and experiencing the difference. The complete <em>Hopestar </em>MANTRA for containing and managing cancer is brought out in Part Two of this Book.</p>
		<p>I have since been helping and guiding the cancer affected or concerned persons from Karnataka and outside, by recommending them the option and applicability of<em> Hopestar</em> MANTRA for treating and managing cancer of different types. Most of them have responded favourably, while living a pain free life and are experiencing the feel good factor. As HCG, i.e., Honorary Cancer Guide, the author can be reached / contacted at the undernoted address : </p>

		<p><strong>Illustrative Cases of Cancer Affected Persons, who have responded favourably to the </strong><em>Hopestar</em><strong> MANTRA as Alternative Medicine / Modality of Treatment</strong></p>
		<p><strong>1. Mr. Dhanya Kumar Khobare, aged 74, Businessman, Hubli.</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosed as having Renal Cell Carcinoma of Left Kidney. </em></p>
		<p>During January 2016, I was informed by Mrs. Khobare that her husband Dhanya Kumar, whom I had known from our engineering college days, having undergone surgery of his kidney cancer, and sought my help. My wife Nalini and I visited them at their house in Hubli. I noted that his condition was as under :</p>
		<p>1. Being anaemic with Hb as low as 7-9%; 2. Loss of appetite and taste; 3. Speech was incoherent, as his cancer had spread to brain; 4. Was having bleeding in stool; 5. Was feeling isolated, and totally cut off from any social interface. </p>
		<p>Since his Kidney Cancer called as Renal Cell Carcinoma had metastasized, he was under oral chemo protocol, 3 months after he underwent surgery.</p>
		<p>I did discuss with them, and apprised of the alternative medicine or modality of treatment, which I had tried on myself, and even advised several cancer patients, who had given appreciative feedback.</p>
		<p>Both of them consulted their Oncologist, and got his nod before starting the alternative treatment.</p>
		<p>I advised them, as a first step, to immediately go to Narasipura and meet Vaidya Narayan Murthy, and take the Herbal Powders he gives. Till such time, I suggested them to go in for Simarouba Leaves which I offered them sufficiently to last for 30 days.</p>
		<p>Following the various steps, processes and procedures as outlined in the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra, Mr. Khobare started taking this Simarouba Decoction prepared with the additives Cumin Seeds and Turmeric, as the options available in the Protocol. On being further advised to take Apricot Kernels as an additional requirement, he began consuming them daily along with the Simarouba Decoction in the dosage of 2 - 2 - 2. With a view to enabling Mr. Khobare to improve his Hb %, he was advised to take Green Juice, Honey and Dates, as specified. This arrangement was an interim measure to take care of his condition in the intervening time till he visits Narasipura and meets Vaidya Narayan Murthy.</p>
		<p>To his relief, Mr. Khobare, within a period of 30 days found improvement in his appetite and started feeling better. Gradually, he was coming out of his mild depression. </p>
		<p>Encouraged by the good improvement in his health condition, Mr. Khobare visited Vaidya Narayan Murthy, and got Herbal Powder for the next three months. Accordingly, he started taking the Herbal Powders (Decoction) with Protocol of Apricot Kernels, Turmeric and Cumin. He continued this programme for next three months.</p>
		<p>The results were so positive and encouraging that his general health improved, and he returned to near normal. Then, he started going for regular walking and sun exposure. To further improve his depressed condition, he joined Brahma Kumari Meditation Center near his house and took up practice of Raj Yoga Meditation. </p>
		<p>The combined effect of the herbal intake, walking and meditation, which was nothing but applied <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra, turned out to be remarkable in terms of his health condition and feel good factor within a period of five months. He has thereafter started attending his Office Work regularly.</p>
		<p>He has since taken the PET Test, and the Report of which indicates reduction in the SUV values. His Oncologist has said that the PET Report discloses considerable improvement, and advised him to regularly consume nutritious foods, while taking good rest. Thus, Mr. Khobare has shown a significant improvement in his cancer condition and overall health, </p>
		<p>He is, however, continuing the Alternative Modality of Treatment comprising Simarouba Decoction, Kokum Juice, Wheat Grass Juice and the Alkalizer. </p>
		<p><strong>2. Mr. B.K. Jorapur, aged 66, Chartered Accountant, Mumbai</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosed as having Adeno Carcinoma of Left Lung</em></p>
		<p>Mr. B.K. Jorapur, who was diagnosed as having lung cancer in Dec. 2015, contacted me in Feb. 2016, and explained his condition. By then, he had taken 3 Cycles of Chemotherapy in Mumbai.</p>
		<p>His condition as reported was not good, as he had the following symptoms&#160;: </p>
		<p>1. Having very severe side effects from Chemo; 2. Loss in Appetite; 3. Hb % was around 10; 4. Suffering from depression and Insomnia; 5.&#160;Had become weak and anaemic</p>
		<p>With the consent of his Oncologist, Mr. Jorapur agreed to take <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra as Complementary Medicine for his cancer condition. Accordingly, I arranged for him the Herbal Powder combinations from Vaidya Narayan Murthy of Narasipura, through his brother, who had come to Dharwad. I also advised Mr. Jorapur to take simultaneously Apricot Kernels in 4-4-4 dose schedule every day.</p>
		<p>Thus, Mr. Jorapur began pursuing the steps and procedures described in the Hopestar Mantra, while taking Green Juice and Gomutra along with the above Protocol. He was advised to take 2 dates every day for getting good rest, sleep and additional boost of energy.</p>
		<p>Since his cancer treatment was on, he was advised by his Oncologist to continue taking some more chemo cycles, while Mr. Jorapur was undergoing Complementary and Conventional Treatments in tandem. </p>
		<p>The <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra that Mr. Jorapur followed resulted in improvement of his general health. Not only this, but side effects and reactions typically resulting from Chemo cycles that he was taking were duly contained.</p>
		<p>Thus, his overall health improved, and his apprehension about side effects or reactions such as nausea, loss of appetite and collateral damage from further Chemo treatment also got allayed and disappeared.</p>
		<p>He followed the Protocol recommended under <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra religiously for six months, and finally got CT Scan done in mid-December 2016. The Report showed several areas of significant improvements in his carcinoma.</p>
		<p>Mr. Jorapur has since been feeling good, and is in better health; his appetite has improved, and is very active. He has started attending office daily for 4 hours, travelling from Goregaon to Churchgate by local train.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Mr. Vasant Nayak, aged 72, Retd. AC, HDMC, Dharwad</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosed as having Intestinal Cancer in early 2015</em></p>
		<p>Mr. Vasant Nayak was diagnosed as having intestinal cancer when he underwent Surgery and Chemotherapy treatment. On attaining complete remission, he was discharged from the Hospital in December 2015.</p>
		<p>When he came in touch with me to seek guidance on the his post remission care, his condition was as under :</p>
		<p>1. Very weak; 2. Anaemic with Hb 8-9%; 3. No Appetite; 4. Insomnia; 5. Mild Depression </p>
		<p>He opted for Simarouba Glauca Protocol as per <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra. </p>
		<p>It is now almost one year that he has been religiously taking this Treatment Protocol, combined with the other steps and procedures stated in the Hopestar Mantra. His Hb as per his recent Blood Test is 12%, and the anaemic look on his face has disappeared. He has regained his appetite, and is enjoying good rest as well as sleep. He goes on long walks daily, and does mild exercises.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Mr. Chirag Mehta, aged 58, Businessman, Ahmedabad</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosed as having Prostate Cancer</em></p>
		<p>Mr. Chirag Mehta was afflicted with, and diagnosed as having Prostate Cancer Stage II at an early stage.</p>
		<p>He underwent surgery of Prostate, and was treated with Chemotherapy Post Surgery, which cleared him of any trace of malignancy, and he had complete remission. But, he was all the while worried and apprehensive of possible relapse or revisiting of prostate cancer, since his PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) level was higher than the reference range.</p>
		<p>Mr. Chirag Mehta came to know that I had Cancer of the Lymph called non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and that after remission I was devoting time on finding alternative medicine / modality of treatment for different Cancers.</p>
		<p>He contacted me during 2014, and when I talked to him, he told me of his doubts and fears of cancer relapse or recurrence, because his PSA level or value was on the higher side. When we finally met, I noted that his condition and symptoms were as under : </p>
		<p>1. Higher PSA level; 2. Anaemic; 3. Nausea; 4. Insomnia; 5. Loss of Appetite; 6. Physically Weak; 7. Unable to travel often; 8. Sickly</p>
		<p>He came to Dharwad during early 2015, and I took him to Vaidya Narayan Murthy of Narasipura for getting herbal barks for his treatment. </p>
		<p>Vaidya Narayan Murthy gave him a combination of 3 barks, and explained the method and dosage to be followed. He was advised to take Apricot Kernels 6-6-6 daily, along with Dates and Alkalizer Protocol.</p>
		<p>Following the steps and procedures under the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra, he has been taking the Protocol of herbal and nutritional intakes for the last 8 months regularly, Mr. Mehta’s condition became stable and normal, with his PSA level becoming less than 4.</p>
		<p>His anaemic condition has improved, and appetite; he goes for regular walks in the morning besides practising Transcendental Meditation.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Mrs. Sneha Kulkarni, aged 52, Hosayellapur, Dharwad</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosis : Blood Cancer, and medically known as  ‘Leukemia’</em></p>
		<p>Initially, Mrs. Sneha Kulkarni underwent Chemo Therapy, but did not continue after two cycles, due to severe pain, nausea and side effects.</p>
		<p>She then approached us for advice and guidance to overcome and manage her Cancer. When she reached me, she was very anemic with alarmingly low RBC, and Hb %, loss of appetite, acute nausea, and thereby developed depression and fever.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Sneha Kulkarni was advised to go in for <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra with the Protocol of Vaidya Narayan Murthy, for three months initially. In addition, she was advised to take regularly Wheat Grass Juice for improving her blood count.</p>
		<p>Within three months her RBC improved and Hb count was within 10%, Encouraged by the favourable outcome, she switched over to the specific Protocol of the Simarouba Glauca Decoction, along with the rest of the Protocol fixed earlier. She is continuing with this programme for the last four months, and is living normal life.</p>
		<p><strong>6. Mr. Kumarswamy Hiremath, aged 50, Madihal, Dharwad</strong></p>
		<p><em>Diagnosed as having Oesophagus Cancer Stage III</em></p>
		<p>Upon diagnosis, Mr. Kumarswamy Hiremath was advised to take Radiation as well as Chemotherapy treatment. Though he started with conventional medicine treatment, he gave it up midway, as he could not afford the high treatment cost. </p>
		<p>When he came to me, I found his condition bad, due to difficulty in eating food, as also want of food and mobility. </p>
		<p>He was advised to take Vaidya Narayan Murthy’s Herbal Powder Decoction Protocol with Curcumin and Turmeric. Further, he was asked to take Kokum Juice, and Apricot Kernels in the form of 4-4-4 and follow the steps detailed in the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra. </p>
		<p>Mr. Hiremath has taken this treatment regularly for six months, and his overall condition is improving. He is now able to eat semi solid food such as dalia, ganjee, etc. and he has regained his voice. His general health is back to normal, with improved appetite and rest.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Annexure I</span>Signs and Symptoms of Cancer </h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">E</span>arly diagnosis will often significantly raise the success rate in the battle against cancer. However, many cancer symptoms are also common in other illnesses, leading doctors to initially diagnose these illnesses, instead of cancer. While signs and symptoms of cancer are described here below, typical signs and symptoms of certain cancers are specially explained, which should serve as a warning sign for catching cancer early, and saving lives of the affected.</p>
		<p><strong>What are signs and symptoms in common diseases ?</strong></p>
		<p>Signs and symptoms are both indicative of injury, illness, disease and disorders, which are signals that something is not right in the body.</p>
		<p>A <em>sign</em> is a signal that can be seen by someone else – maybe a loved one, or a doctor, nurse or other health care professional. For example, fever, fast breathing, and abnormal lung sounds heard in stethoscope may be signs of pneumonia.</p>
		<p>A <em>symptom</em> is a signal that’s felt or noticed by the affected person, but may not be easily seen by anyone else. For that matter, weakness, ache and feeling short of breath may be symptoms of pneumonia.</p>
		<p><strong>What are the signs and symptoms of Cancer?</strong></p>
		<p>Cancer is a group of diseases that can cause almost any sign or symptom. The signs and symptoms will depend on where the cancer is, how big it is, and how much it affects the organs or tissues. If a cancer has spread, signs or symptoms may appear in different parts of the body.</p>
		<p>As cancer grows, it can begin to push on nearby organs, blood vessels and nerves. This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer. If the cancer is in a critical area, such as certain parts of the brain, even the smallest tumor can cause symptoms.</p>
		<p>But sometimes cancer starts in places where it won’t cause any signs or symptoms until it has grown quite large. Cancers of the pancreas, for example, usually don’t cause symptoms until they grow large enough to press on nearby nerves or organs (this causes back or belly pain). Others may grow around the bile duct and block the flow of bile. This causes the eyes and skin to look yellow (<em>jaundice)</em>. By the time a pancreatic cancer causes signs or symptoms like these, it’s usually in an advanced stage. This means it has grown and spread beyond the place it started. </p>
		<p>A cancer may also cause symptoms like fever, extreme tiredness (<em>fatigue)</em>, or weight loss. This may be because cancer cells use up much of the body’s energy supply, or they may release substances that change the way the body makes energy from food. Cancer can also cause the immune system to react in ways that produce these signs and symptoms.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, cancer cells release substances into the bloodstream that cause symptoms that are not usually linked to cancer. For example, some cancers of the pancreas can release substances that cause blood clots in veins of the legs. Some lung cancers make hormone-like substances that raise blood calcium levels. This affects nerves and muscles, making the person feel weak and dizzy.</p>
		<p><strong>How are signs and symptoms helpful ? </strong></p>
		<p>Treatment works best when cancer is found early – while it’s still small, and is less likely to have spread to other parts of the body. This often means a better chance for becoming free from  the cancer disease if the cancer can be removed by surgery.</p>
		<p>A good example of the importance of finding cancer early is melanoma skin cancer. It can be easy to remove if it has not grown deep into the skin. The <em>5-year survival rate</em> (percentage of people who live at least 5 years after diagnosis) at this early stage is around 98%. Once melanoma spreads to other parts of the body, the survival rate drops to about 16%.</p>
		<p>Sometimes people ignore symptoms. Maybe they don’t know that the symptoms could mean something is wrong. Or they might be frightened by what the symptoms could mean and don’t want to get medical help. Maybe they just can’t afford to get medical care.</p>
		<p>Some symptoms, such as tiredness or coughing, are more likely caused by something other than cancer. Symptoms can seem unimportant, especially if there’s a clear cause or the problem only lasts a short time. Likewise, a person may reason that symptom like breast lump is probably a cyst that will go away by itself. But no symptom must be ignored or overlooked, especially if it has lasted a long time or is getting worse.</p>
		<p>Most likely, symptoms are not caused by cancer, but it’s important to have them checked out, just in case. If cancer is not the cause, a doctor can help figure out what the cause is and treat it, if needed.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, it’s possible to find cancer before having symptoms. Cancer Societies and other health groups recommend cancer-related check-ups and certain tests for people, even though they have no symptoms. This helps find certain cancers early, before symptoms start. But keep in mind, even if you have the suggested tests, it’s still important to see a doctor if you have any symptoms.</p>
		<p><strong>What are the general signs and symptoms of cancer ?</strong></p>
		<p>You should know some of the general signs and symptoms of cancer. But remember, having any of these does not mean that you have cancer – many other things cause these signs and symptoms, too. If you have any of these symptoms, and they last for a long time or get worse, please see a doctor to find out what’s going on.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Unexplained weight loss</em></strong></p>
		<p>Most people with cancer will lose weight at some point. When you lose weight for no known reason, it’s called an <em>unexplained weight loss</em>. An unexplained weight loss of 15 kgs and above may be the first sign of cancer. This happens most often with cancers of pancreas, stomach, esophagus or lung.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Fever</em></strong></p>
		<p>Fever is very common with cancer, but it more often happens after cancer has spread from where it started. Almost all people with cancer will have fever at some time, especially if the cancer or its treatment affects the immune system. Less often, fever may be an early sign of cancer, such as blood cancers like leukemia or lymphoma.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Fatigue</em></strong></p>
		<p>Fatigue is extreme tiredness that doesn’t get better with rest. It may be an important symptom as cancer grows. But it may happen early in some cancers, like leukemia. Some colon or stomach cancers can cause blood loss that’s not obvious. This is another way of saying that cancer can cause fatigue.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Pain</em></strong></p>
		<p>Pain may be an early symptom with some cancers like bone cancers or testicular cancer. A headache that does not go away or get better with treatment may be a symptom of brain tumor. Back pain can be a symptom of cancer of the colon, rectum, or ovary. Most often, pain due to cancer means it has already spread (<em>metastasized</em>) from where it started.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Skin changes</em></strong></p>
		<p>Along with skin cancers, some other cancers can cause skin changes that can be seen. These signs and symptoms include :</p>
		<p>Darker looking skin (<em>hyperpigmentation)</em></p>
		<p>Yellowish skin and eyes (<em>jaundice)</em></p>
		<p>Reddened skin (<em>erythema)</em></p>
		<p>Itching (<em>pruritis)</em></p>
		<p>Excessive hair growth</p>
		<p><strong>Signs and Signals as Warnings of Certain Cancers</strong></p>
		<p><strong>1. Colon Cancer </strong></p>
		<p>Colon cancer is considered to be one of the deadliest forms of cancer, and manifests as growths in the lining of the colon and / or rectum. When diagnosed early enough, the success rate for treatments is very high.</p>
		<p><em>Blood in stool : </em></p>
		<p>The appearance of blood in the stool may indicate stomach and intestinal illnesses, but could also serve as a warning sign for colon cancer. If you find fresh blood in your stool, or have black stool, even in small amounts, this should not be ignored, but a physician consulted immediately.</p>
		<p><em>Unusually fast or slow bowel movements : </em></p>
		<p>When your digestive system doesn’t work properly, it can lead to chronic diarrhoea or constipation – a possible sign of colon cancer. If your bowel movements are not normal for weeks, or don’t respond to medical treatment, it may serve as a warning sign for cancer.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS : 1) Severe stomach aches; 2)Lumps in stomach; </p>
		<p><strong>2. Ovarian Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>This type of cancer attacks the ovarian tissues and is mostly common in women over the age of 50, but it can also appear in younger women. The reasons for occurrence of such type of cancer are not very well known. The known factors are genetic, avoiding getting pregnant and fertility treatments.</p>
		<p><em>Indigestion :</em></p>
		<p>Symptoms such as bloating, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, and gas can be indicative of ovarian cancer. Since many women experience these kinds of sensitivities in their digestive system, people rarely attribute it to cancer. This is why it’s important to have these symptoms checked, if only to rule out cancer.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS : 1) Loss of appetite or feeling full quickly; 2) Pelvic and lower-back pains; 3) Frequent urination; 4) Abnormal bleeding after menopause </p>
		<p><strong>3. Skin Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Skin cancer often attacks the surface of the skin, which later metastasizes into other parts of the body. The main cause of this type of cancer is unprotected exposure to sunlight, and it occurs among fair-skinned individuals in particular.</p>
		<p><em>A change in the shape, size or color of moles or beauty marks : </em></p>
		<p>Most moles and beauty marks are benign, but some may indicate the presence of skin cancer. New moles and beauty marks, ones that change their color, shape or size in short time (weeks/months), or a change in texture to brittle / greasy or bloody are all symptoms of skin cancer. Even if you don’t feel like having them checked, it’s important to keep an eye on them, because anyone is susceptible. Early diagnosis can save life, even in cases of malignant melanoma.</p>
		<p><em>Skin sores that don’t heal after a couple of weeks :</em></p>
		<p>Our skin has the ability to repair damages it experiences, but in some cases, such lesions and sores don’t heal for weeks. This must serve as a warning, so if you notice such sores or lesions on your skin, contact your Doctor immediately.</p>
		<p><em>The appearance of spots or a change in the texture of the skin :</em></p>
		<p>If you notice new spots on your body, or have ones you’ve never checked, as well as a change in their colour or texture, they must be tested change in their color and texture, they must be tested as they can be a warning sign of cancer.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Breast Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Breast cancer usually starts as a small, painless lump(s) in the breasts, and later metastasizes into the rest of the body. Diagnosing breast cancer quickly increases the survival rate considerably. Breast cancer is mostly common in women over the age of 50, but it can appear in any woman of any age. It is also possible for men to get breast cancer, but such cases are very rare.</p>
		<p><em>Abnormal lumps or swelling of the breasts :</em></p>
		<p>The most common symptoms of breast cancer are the appearance of lumps, swelling or edema. They may not be painful, but should be checked by a doctor. </p>
		<p><em>Inflammation, lumps and dimples on the breasts :</em></p>
		<p>Visible changes such as inflammation, bumps or dimples on the breasts could be indicative of cancer. Even if you think that the symptoms are barely noticeable, don’t ignore them – if it truly is breast cancer, early discovery can save your life.</p>
		<p><em>Nipples : change in location / inflammation / secretions :</em></p>
		<p>If the skin of your nipple changes texture or becomes brittle, if it becomes inflamed, swollen, changes shape or location (flattening or sinking of the nipple), or you experience secretions – these are all common indicators of breast cancer. If the symptoms don’t disappear after a while, consult with your physician.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS : 1) Chronic pain in the breasts or armpits; 2) Uneven, Inflamed blood vessels; 3) Swelling of the armpits or the armpits or the collar bone; 4) Sores on the breasts</p>
		<p><strong>5. Lung Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>This deadly cancer is common in both women and men, and leads to the formation of growths in the lungs, ultimately destroying them. The most common cause of this cancer is first and second-hand smoking of tobacco products, pollution, exposure to hazardous chemicals, radiation, etc.</p>
		<p><em>Shortness of breath :</em></p>
		<p>Do you feel like you’re out of breath more often, even when you’re resting, or that you’re constantly wheezing ? It may indicate lung cancer. If the shortness of breath is a result of an airway infection that doesn’t respond to medication, it can also serve as a warning sign.</p>
		<p><em>Chronic cough or bloody cough :</em></p>
		<p>Coughing on its own is a common thing, especially during and after a cold or the flu. If your coughing continues for 3 weeks or longer, or gets worse, it should serve as a warning sign. Even if you’re in good health, but the cough persists, it may indicate lung cancer. If you cough blood, even in small amounts, consult your physician immediately.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS</p>
		<p>Sharp pain in the chest or shoulder when taking a deep breath</p>
		<p>Swelling in the neck, particularly in the lymph nodes</p>
		<p>Difficulty swallowing, and</p>
		<p>Lethargy</p>
		<p><strong>6. Stomach Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Stomach cancer appears as growths in the lining of the stomach, which later spread to the lymph nodes and the organs that are in close proximity to the stomach. The causes for this cancer are unknown, though it is said that regular consumption of preservatives triggers the disease.</p>
		<p><em>Drastic, unintentional weight-loss :</em></p>
		<p>We may experience weight fluctuations in our lives, planned or otherwise. However, if you experience a drastic loss of weight when you haven’t changed your lifestyle, it may indicate stomach cancer.</p>
		<p><em>Chronic indigestion :</em></p>
		<p>Indigestion can occur quite often and for various reasons, but when it’s accompanied by intense pain, happens spontaneously (without any explanation), or chronic indigestion, it could be a symptom of stomach cancer. It’s important to inform your physician of these symptoms.</p>
		<p><strong>7. Cancer of the Mouth</strong></p>
		<p>Growths in the oral cavity, on the tongue, lips and gums, as well as the salivary glands and tonsils are common in cases of mouth cancer. If it metastasizes, this cancer will damage the lymphatic system, as well as head and lungs. It’s more common in men than women who are over 40 years. Quitting cigarettes and reducing alcohol consumption can drastically decrease the risk of this cancer.</p>
		<p><em>Mouth or tongue ulcers that last for more than three weeks :</em></p>
		<p>Many people experience occasional mouth ulcer, which may be caused by stress, changes in the weather or a compromised immune system. In cases where such ulcers don’t heal after three weeks, they may be symptomatic of mouth cancer.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS </p>
		<p><em>Red or white spots in the oral cavity :</em></p>
		<p>Unexplained pain in the mouth or ears</p>
		<p>Unexplained lump in the throat</p>
		<p>Intense sore throat</p>
		<p>Hoarseness and trouble swallowing</p>
		<p>Oral swelling and bleeding</p>
		<p>Color changes in the lips, gums, tongue and inner cheeks</p>
		<p><strong>8. Throat Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Growths on the vocal chords and the lining of the throat are symptomatic of throat cancer, and can spread to the esophagus, neck, and lymph nodes. Changing to a healthy lifestyle, as well as quitting cigarettes and alcohol can drastically reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer.</p>
		<p><em>Lumps or swelling in the neck that last more than three weeks :</em></p>
		<p>Any inflammation or lumps you notice that last more than 3 weeks can be a symptom of throat cancer. Whether the swelling / lumps are painful or not, or whether they’re big or small, you need to contact your doctor. </p>
		<p><em>Pain in the esophagus and trouble swallowing :</em></p>
		<p>When we swallow our food, it goes through our esophagus on its way to the stomach. If you are having difficulties swallowing your food, or feel pain while doing so, or feel that the food has got stuck in the esophagus, and won’t go on, you should immediately check with your doctor.</p>
		<p>OTHER SYMPTOMS : 1) Hoarseness; 2) Chronic Vomiting; 3) Chronic Cough with Blood; 4) Unexplained loss of weight. </p>
		<p><strong>9. Prostate Cancer </strong></p>
		<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer for men, especially those aged 70 and above. This cancer is in fact a malignant tumor in the prostate gland, which belongs to the male’s reproductive system and is located close to the bladder.</p>
		<p><em>Difficulty urinating :</em></p>
		<p>One of the most common problems of aging in men is having problems urinating. However, this is also a common symptom of prostate cancer, and as such, problems should not be ignored just because you are of a certain age. Problems like passing urine frequently or trouble pushing it out or not being able to hold it are major symptoms of this cancer.</p>
		<p><strong>Other symptoms:</strong></p>
		<p>Blood in the urine</p>
		<p>A burning sensation while urinating</p>
		<p>Blood in the semen</p>
		<p><strong>10. Non - Hodgkin’s Lymphoma</strong></p>
		<p>Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can cause many different signs and symptoms, including lumps or growths depending on where it is in the body. In some cases, it might not cause any symptoms until it grows quite large.</p>
		<p><strong>Symptoms :</strong></p>
		<p>Enlarged lymph nodes; Swollen abdomen (belly); Feeling full with small amount of food; Chest pain or pressure; Shortness of breath or cough; Fever; Weight Loss; Night Sweats; Fatigue (extreme tiredness); Low red blood cell counts. </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Annexure II</span>Chemotherapy demystified and explained </h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he Chemotherapy procedure is not usually a single treatment, but a course of treatments. A course usually takes 3 to 6 months time, but can be more or less than that. The treatment will include one or more chemotherapy drugs that a cancer patient may have to take. During a course of treatment, the patient is usually expected to take 4 to 8 cycles of Chemo. A cycle is the time of one round of treatment till the start of the next. After each round of treatment, there will be a break before the next treatment, to allow the patient’s body to recover.</p>
		<p>Chemotherapy drugs aim to kill the cancer cells, while causing as little harm as possible to healthy cells. But they kill rapidly dividing cells in a variety of ways. At any one time, some of the cancer cells will be resting. Chemotherapy only attacks cells that are in the process of splitting into two. So, resting cells will not be killed. Some of the cancer cells that were resting during the first treatment will be dividing by the time your second cycle comes around, and hence they will be killed off. Normal cells repair damage caused by Chemotherapy more effectively than cancer cells. Accordingly, damage to the cancer cells should progressively build up without causing permanent damage to normal cells. </p>
		<p>The fact that chemotherapy drugs kill the dividing cells helps to explain why chemotherapy causes side effects. It affects healthy body tissues where the cells are constantly growing and dividing. The skin, bone marrow, hair follicles and lining of the digestive system (gut) are examples of cells that are constantly growing and dividing. Since these tissues have dividing cells, they can be damaged by chemotherapy. But normal cells can replace or repair the healthy cells that are damaged by chemotherapy. So the damage to healthy cells doesn’t usually last. Rest between two cycles allows the body to recover from any side effects. Most of the side effects disappear once the treatment is over, and some only happen during the days when the patient is receiving drugs, for example, sickness or diarrhoea. </p>
		<p><strong>What is Chemotherapy, and how does it work ? </strong></p>
		<p>Chemotherapy comprises of drugs and medications that treat Cancer specific. In order to understand how these medications work, we need to understand a bit about tumor cells. Tumors are made up of cells that are reproducing abnormally at high rate. Normal cells know to stop reproducing (or dividing) when they come into contact with other cells. In case of a tumor, this stop mechanism is missing, thus causing cells to divide over and over. The RNA or DNA of a cell tells it how to replicate itself, and classic chemotherapy works by destroying this RNA or DNA. The more rapidly the tumor cells are replicating, it is better that the cells are killed. </p>
		<p>Cell replication occurs in a series of phases, called the Cell cycle. The cell cycle phases are :</p>
		<p>1.&#9;RESTING (G 0; Nothing is happening)</p>
		<p>2.&#9;G1 (or Gap 1; a growth phase)</p>
		<p>3.&#9;S (Synthesis : the replication of DNA occurs)</p>
		<p>4.&#9;G2 (Gap 2; another Growth Phase), and</p>
		<p>5.&#9;M (mitosis; the actual division from one cell into two)</p>
		<p>Some chemotherapy agents are able to kill a cell during any phase of the above cycle (these are called cell-cycle nonspecific), others are only able to kill during a specific phase, but unable to work in resting phase (called cell-cycle specific). By giving cell–cycle specific agents at multiple time points, they are able to reach the maximum number of cells in the particular phase they affect. </p>
		<p>These are, therefore, most effective when given in divided doses (over multiple days or time points, for example : once a day for 5 days or every three hours for four doses) or by continuous infusion, Cell cycle nonspecific drugs act against cancer cells at any phase of the cell cycle, including the resting phase. By and large Cell cycle nonspecific drugs are most effective when given in bonus doses (for e.g., once in 20 minutes +). </p>
		<p>Cell death may not occur at the exact time chemotherapy is given. Often a cell must undergo several divisions before it ultimately dies. Since not all cancer cells die after chemotherapy treatment, repeated doses are used to continue to reduce the cells.</p>
		<p><strong>How is Chemotherapy given and administered ? </strong></p>
		<p>Chemotherapy is considered a ‘systemic’ therapy, meaning that it travels all over the body, unlike surgery or radiation, which are “local” therapies. The Chemotherapy specifics or variants given in the sequence of treatments are :</p>
		<p><em>Adjuvant therapy</em> : Given after surgery to reduce the possibility of cancer returning.</p>
		<p><em>Neo- adjuvant therapy</em> : Given before surgery to shrink the tumor, allowing the surgery to be more successful.</p>
		<p><em>Concurrent therapy</em> : Given together such as chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
		<p>Chemotherapy can be given in the following ways : (1) Orally (by mouth, in pill form); (2) Intravenously (IV, through a vein, either as a short infusion or continuously for one or more days); (3) As an injection or needle directly into a body cavity (i.e, bladder, abdominal cavity); (4) Intra arterially (in spl cases, i.e., limb perfusion treatment or melanoma)</p>
		<p>Oncologists often combine specific and nonspecific chemotherapies thereby complementing each other and for working together. Combination of different medications is called a “regimen”. These regimens are often given names based on the first letter of the medications used in them. For instance, CHOP, a common regimen for lymphoma, is made up of Cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide); Adriamycin (Hydroxy doxorubicin); Oncovin (Vincristine) and Prednisone. This combination is given in “cycles” (blocks of time). Thus, a cycle may be of 21 days. </p>
		<p><strong>How to know Chemotherapy is working on the patient or not?</strong></p>
		<p>There are different goals of chemotherapy treatment, depending on the site and stage of disease, besides other individual factors (like medical issues), previous treatments (functional status) etc. that may impact the effectiveness of treatment. </p>
		<p><em>Goals of Chemotherapy include :</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cure the Cancer</li>
			<li>Prevent the Cancer from spreading </li>
			<li>Slow the growth of Cancer</li>
			<li>Kill cancer cells in sites other than the primary site (metastases)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cancer care teams use various methods to gauge if the treatment is working, depending on the type of cancer being treated. Many patients will have radiology studies (CT Scans, MRIs, Pet Scans) periodically to see if the tumor has responded (either shrunk or stayed the same versus become bigger or spread). Some types of tumors can be followed by checking a “tumor marker” in the blood. This is a substance that is either produced by the tumor or by the body in response to the tumor, and can be measured by simple blood test. If Chemotherapy is working, one would expect the tumor marker to decrease. In some cases, a decrease in a patient’s symptoms might be a sign of whether the medications are working against the tumor or not. The patient or the family member should talk to the attending doctor or nurse to know how his /her response will be measured.</p>
		<p><strong>What are the short and long term effects and side effects of Chemotherapy ? </strong></p>
		<p>As with most drugs, chemotherapy drugs do have side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy are unwanted things that happen as a direct result of taking a drug. It is easy to confuse drug side effects with symptoms of cancer. Symptoms are the things that happen as a direct result of having Cancer, and have nothing to do with the drug.</p>
		<p>Different chemotherapy drugs have different short term and long term side effects and certainly not all chemotherapy drugs cause every side effect. In general, chemotherapy damages cells that are dividing, so the parts of the body where normal cells divide frequently are likely to be affected by chemotherapy. The mouth, intestines, skin, hair, and bone marrow are commonly affected by chemo. Hair is growing all the time. The skin is constantly renewing itself. So are the lining of the mouth and digestive system. To do this, the cells of all these body tissues must constantly divide to produce a steady supply of new cells. And when cells are dividing, chemotherapy drugs can attack them.</p>
		<p>Although most anti-cancer drugs have side effects, not everyone will get them. A person may experience no side effects of chemotherapy, some side effects or all of them. Whether or not a person will experience a particular side effect, when it will start and stop or how bad it will be depends on how long the person has been taking the drug, a person’s general health, the dose or amount of the drug, the way the drug is given, or other drugs that may be given in combination.</p>
		<p><em>Some important points to note in regard to short and long term side effects of chemotherapy are as under :</em></p>
		<p>Some side effects of chemotherapy are serious medical conditions that need to be treated (like Herpes and Deep Vein Thrombosis) </p>
		<p>Some side effects are inconvenient or upsetting, but are not damaging your health (such as blackening of Finger Nails, Skin)</p>
		<p>Ensure to discuss the side effects with your healthcare team</p>
		<p>If you are worried about a side effect, call your doctor or the contact at the center where your treatment is being given.</p>
		<p>Most side effects do not do any lasting harm, and will gradually go away after treatment finishes.</p>
		<p>If you do not get any side effects, it does not mean that your treatment is not working.</p>
		<p>There are very few long term side effects of chemotherapy. Most are short term. Deep Vein Thrombosis takes some more time before it disappears. In some rare cases, the veins through which Chemo drug is administered get blocked and <span lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB">auxilliary</span> system development takes long to take shape.</p>
		<p>The side effects of chemotherapy may not be pleasant. But it would help and enable the patients to understand the problems in relation to the benefits of the treatment. Chemotherapy does not cause side effects in everyone. It causes different reactions in different people. Remember, almost all side effects are temporary. And they will gradually disappear once treatment stops.</p>
