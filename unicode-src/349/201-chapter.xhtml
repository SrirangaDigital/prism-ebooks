		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 1</span>An Alternative Approach to Treating Cancer</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">H</span>aving gone through the treatment of my cancer with conventional / mainstream or modern medicine, I learnt some lessons. For, I went through the trials and tribulations as a cancer patient taking the critical chemotherapy treatment, and eventually attaining complete remission. While I suffered helplessly from the collateral damage caused by the side effects and reactions of chemotherapy, I had to bear with the devastating impact of cancer treatment on me physically, mentally and financially. I believe, and I am certain, every cancer patient who has undergone conventional treatment, comes out of the Hospital with the same feeling and traumatic experience. </p>
		<p>The question that troubled me was “Why cancer treatment cannot be made tolerable, affordable and less rigorous or probably moderate in terms of pain and suffering ?” </p>
		<p>Hence I embarked on the journey of exploring, learning and pursuing the complementary, alternative and integrative medicines or modalities of treatment for alleviating and controlling cancer. In particular, I was clear and strongly felt that the alternative modality of treatment ought to be affordable or available at low cost, and without having the side effects and reactions usually associated with conventional medicine. In my relentless search and quest for an option or alternative modality to conventional medicine for fighting and managing cancer, I found more and more people affected with cancer willing to look at affordable treatment modality, without causing collateral damage to the human body and mind.</p>
		<p>The tentative plan of pursuing and arriving at an alternative approach to alleviating and managing cancer was conceived during the last lap of my cancer treatment, which started evolving and materialising after I attained complete remission. I must say I found out, observed and realised that complementary and alternative medicine provides practical and affordable option or solution for fighting and managing cancer of different types, without causing collateral damage. I strenuously pursued and worked on the permutations and combinations of various known and less known procedures, including specific protocols of herbal medicines and healing foods for alleviating the condition and suffering of cancer patients. It has since been a turning point in my cancer saga and journey. I have finally succeeded in finding out a recipe or solution for containing and managing cancer. This simple solution describes the detailed processes envisaged therein, which I tried on myself first, and later reached out to a few known cancer affected persons to test out its effectiveness or efficacy.</p>
		<p>When I found the results were favourable, encouraging and positive, I came out with a Mantra, which is the recipe or solution for alleviating and managing cancer. I have named it <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra, with the prefix being an acronym for the steps / procedures stated therein&#160;: Hydration, Oxidation, Protocol, Energisation, Stabilisation, Alkalization &amp; Relaxation.</p>
		<p>Beneath the umbrella of steps and procedures under <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra lies the basis or factors for addressing the disturbances and aberrations in specific areas / parts of the human body that cause different cancers. It is mainly based on the concept of nutritional deficiency in cancer evolved by researcher Dr. G. Edward Griffin, and written in his Book titled “<em>World Without Cancer “ – The Story of Vitamin B 17. </em>Thus, the <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra focusses on these factors&#160;:</p>
		<p>1. Disturbances in the Internal Condition of the Body&#160;: Adverse variations in Hydration, Oxidation and Alkalization Levels </p>
		<p>2. Disturbances in the Physical Parts of the Body&#160;: Injury, Pain, Infection, Ailment, Cell Damage or Mutation due to internal factor (e.g., lack of Vitamin B 17) or external factor (i.e, smoking, alcohol) that cause damage to cells. These need treatment or medical intervention to correct the damage.</p>
		<p>3. Disturbances in Emotional / Psychological Factor of the Person : Undue stress, sleeplessness, abnormal schedules of work, etc. which have to be addressed for containing the cancer.</p>
		<p><em>It is largely due to these conditions and causes, a person becomes vulnerable or susceptible to cancer. </em></p>
		<p><strong>Conditions and Causes factored in the <em>Hopestar</em></strong></p>
		<p><strong>Mantra for Alleviating &amp; Managing Cancer </strong></p>
		<p>1. Improve and Stabilize the Internal Conditions in the Body.</p>
		<p><strong>H</strong>ydration, <strong>O</strong>xidation &amp; alkalization together would enable regulation and stabilisation of the Body Condition.</p>
		<p>2. Treat the Cancer Condition, and Manage the Physical Trauma.</p>
		<p><strong>P</strong>rotocol takes care of the treatment part, and <strong>E</strong>nergisation helps in controlling the Physical Trauma</p>
		<p>3. Set right the Mental and Emotional Factor.</p>
		<p><strong>St</strong>abilization facilitates mental and emotional stability. </p>
		<p><strong>A</strong>lkalization prevents further infections and controls trauma.</p>
		<p><strong>R</strong>elaxation is an elixir for body, mind and spirit </p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 2</span><em>Hopestar </em>Mantra works as an Alternative Modality for alleviating and managing Cancer</h1>
		<p><span class="big-letter">T</span>he Mantra is presented in the form of an acronym <em>HOPESTAR</em> for ease of understanding and remembering all the steps, and the sequence in which they are to be applied. This Chapter explains the nitty-gritty of the MANTRA including the ingredients and methods of preparation; the dosage, quantity and availability of each item; the options from which selection can be done, etc. Once these are understood by the Cancer Affected Person or Relatives doubling up as Care Givers, the <em>Hopestar </em>MANTRA can be applied easily and effortlessly. </p>
		<p>Each alphabet in the acronym <em>HOPESTAR</em> accordingly stands for a step or procedure specific in the treatment plan. Care has to be taken to initially apply the first 4 steps, i.e., HOPE in the <em>Hopestar </em>Mantra for 3 to 6 months. After obtaining response and feedback, the next 3 steps, i.e., STAR in the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra, have to be applied thoroughly till there is alleviation in the condition of the cancer affected person, and the cancer becomes manageable. Specific steps referred or stated in the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra are described in detail hereunder&#160;:</p>
		<p><strong>1. Hydration</strong></p>
		<p>This step ensures that the body of the cancer affected is kept hydrated or having adequate water content at all times. In addition, this step contributes to partially enhancing the level of oxygen. </p>
		<p>Hydration (Water) Level is a quintessential determinant of good health. The fact that 65% of an adult’s body is composed of water is in itself a self explanatory expression of the water requirement by us - the humans. Both by weight and volume, water is the most predominant factor in the human body. One cannot starve or deprive the human body of water for more than 72 hours. </p>
		<p>That too would be oppressive to the body. From the smallest of the cells to the largest of the organs, water has command throughout. There is no single function our body can perform devoid of water. In order that you remain in good health, and all your body functions well, one must take care of hydration level in the body all the time. </p>
		<p><strong>Water Treatment&#160;: Amazing Japanese Method</strong></p>
		<p><em>Drink Water on Empty Stomach, and Contain Cancer</em></p>
		<p>It is a common practice or habit in Japan today to drink water after waking up every morning. Moreover, scientific tests confirm its medical and therapeutic value. To a large number of ailments and diseases, including cancer specifically, water treatment is found to be successful and effective by the Japanese Medical Society. </p>
		<p><strong>Method of Treatment</strong></p>
		<p>1. As you wake up in the morning before brushing teeth, drink 4 glasses of water, equivalent to 640 ml.</p>
		<p>2. Wash &amp; clean your mouth, but don’t eat / drink anything for 45 min</p>
		<p>3. After 45 minutes, you may eat and drink as normal</p>
		<p>4. 15 minutes after breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively; while not eating or drinking for  half an hour thereafter.</p>
		<p>5. Those who are aged or sick, and unable to drink 4 glasses of water at the beginning, may commence by taking little water and gradually increase it to 4 glasses per day.</p>
		<p>6. According to the Japanese Medical Society, the above method of water treatment will alleviate ailments / diseases, and promote a healthy life. </p>
		<p>A period of 180 days is required for alleviating and managing cancer with this water treatment. </p>
		<p>The Japanese Medical Society recommends making this procedure a habit and routine in our life. It is aptly said&#160;:<em>“DRINK WATER &amp; STAY HEALTHY AND ACTIVE”. </em></p>
		<p><strong>2. Oxygenation</strong></p>
		<p>As an offshoot of the first step of water treatment, the Japanese method extends its effect in achieving about 25% of the enhanced Oxygen, because water essentially is two molecules of Hydrogen, and one molecule of Oxygen. The Oxygen present in the water gets absorbed in the blood stream to some extent. Besides adding this Oxygen to the blood stream, the water treatment procedure acts as blood viscosity modulator resulting in better blood flow, which in turn helps blood pressure control.</p>
		<p>Cancer affected persons would have to know that Cancer Cells do not survive in an oxygenated atmosphere. Hence, they must at all times strive to use the available Oxygen around them, and put it to best use.</p>
		<p>It is true, and well known that the earthly atmosphere between 4 am and 6 am in the mornings, contains 40 % more Oxygen than at other times. As such, it would be beneficial and advisable that cancer affected persons get used to waking up before dawn, say about 5 am, drinking warm water then (Hydration), doing some light exercises, Yoga and Pranayama, while inhaling and absorbing as much fresh air containing atmospheric oxygen as possible. </p>
		<p>Walking during early mornings must become part of the daily schedule, which will be in addition to the recommended Exercises, Yoga and Pranayama. Early morning walk provides best time for exposure to sunlight, which contains Ultraviolet Rays. Whatever exposure to Ultraviolet Rays that a cancer affected person gets, would facilitate activation of Vitamin D present under the skin, whereas Vitamin D would be very helpful in improving body metabolism.</p>
		<p>Hydration and Oxygenation process provides and equips the cancer affected person with the basics required for fighting cancer cell growth. </p>
		<p><strong>Following or applying these two steps / procedures  is a pre-requisite for proceeding with the next steps in the <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>3. Protocol </strong></p>
		<p>Among the steps and procedures for bringing about alleviation and improvement in cancer affected persons, it is the Protocol with options, that addresses the nutritional deficiency in cancer </p>
		<p>PROTOCOL for treating cancer under <em>Hopestar</em> Mantra consists of a Common Part on one hand, and an OPTIONAL PART on the other.</p>

		<p><strong>PROTOCOL ‘C’ Option</strong></p>
		<p>DECOCTION OF GRAVIOLA / SOURSOP LEAVES</p>
		<p>The botanical name for Soursop is Annona Muricata. It is called by various names in Hindi and vernacular languages as HANUMAN PHAL or LAXMAN PHAL. It is not to be confused with Ram Phal, despite being from the same family, as it is totally different. The tree is regarded as a miracle herb for Cancer Patients.</p>
		<p>SOURSOP / GRAVIOLA FOR CANCER TREATMENT</p>
		<p>Soursop for cancer treatment needs a special mention. The Graviola Fruit, its juice as well as the tea prepared from Soursop leaves, according to researchers, is beneficial in managing cancer. Soursop attacks cancer cells in a natural way, and does not cause nausea, weight loss and hair loss, which are typical and most common side effects as a result of cancer treatment with chemotherapy drugs. Incidentally, while soursop attacks only the cancer cells, and  they do not harm the healthy cell around the tumour.</p>
		<p>Health benefits from taking graviola / soursop leaves and fruits by cancer patients are as under&#160;:</p>
		<p>1. Increases platelet count</p>
		<p>2. Attacks and neutralises cancer cells only</p>
		<p>3. No side effects like nausea, weight loss and loss in appetite</p>
		<p>4. Protects the immune system, and avoids infections</p>
		<p>5. Imparts strength and health throughout the course of treatment</p>
		<p>6. Effectively targets &amp; kills malignant cells in all types of cancer.</p>
		<p><strong>HOW TO PREPARE GRAVIOLA / SOURSOP TEA&#160;: </strong></p>
		<p>Tea is concocted from broad and lengthy soursop leaves. </p>
		<p>The first step is to get or arrange for 3 to 4 fresh, and not so mature leaves of graviola / soursop tree. Tender leaves give good flavour, and they are rich in flavonoids. Wash them with plain water to remove the dust, and dry the leaves with paper napkin. Shred the leaves into 3 or 4 pieces, and keep them aside.</p>
		<p>Boil one cup of water in a pot, and place the graviola / soursop leaves in the cup, and pour the boiling water over the leaves. Add 1 tsp of Turmeric Powder, 1 tsp of Cumin seeds and ½ tsp of Ginger.</p>
		<p>Cover the cup with a lid, and keep it there for 30 minutes. However, if you want a better flavour, let it remain there for some time. Now your Tea is ready. You may add Honey / Sugar, if you so like. </p>

		<p><strong>Papaya Leaf Cancer Research </strong></p>
		<p>Research done by Dr. Nam Dang at the University of Florida, and colleagues in Japan found extracts from dried papaya leaves killed cancer cells directly, and slowed the growth of tumour cells.</p>
		<p>The leaf extract was effective against different types of cancer including liver, lung, cervix, pancreas and breast cancers. The anti-cancer effects were found to be stronger at higher doses.</p>
		<p><strong>A Homemade Cancer Treatment </strong></p>
		<p>Condensate from Papaya Leaves has been developed on the basis of the recipe made by Lung Cancer Survivor Stan Sheldon from Australia. According to him, the medium sized Papaya Leaves have to be cut and boiled in 2 Litres of water, with One Tsp of Turmeric, ½ Tsp of Cumin Seeds and ¼ Tsp of Ginger added thereon, while heating the liquid mix to a simmer till the liquid content becomes half of the water. It was ready for being taken within a couple of hours After taking this recipe for two months, Cancer Affected Stan Sheldon tested to find that both his lungs were cleared from any traces of cancer. He has reported that the disease has not revisited or relapsed for many many years, and he has since shared this homemade cancer treatment with several other afflicted persons, most of whom have become free from cancer.</p>
		<p>The condensate can be kept or stored in refrigerator in a large glass bottle, which would last for several days, though it is recommended to be discarded if it were to become thick and too cloudy.</p>
		<p><strong>Method of Consumption&#160;: Dosage</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Early Morning Dose:</strong></p>
		<p>75 ml of the Condensate mixed with 1 TSP of Kokum Juice + 2 Spirulina Capsules + 35 ml of Gomutra or 2 Capsules of Gomutra + 6 Apricot Kernels</p>
		<p><strong>Afternoon Dose:</strong></p>
		<p>75 ml of Condensate only + 6 Apricot Kernels</p>
		<p><strong>Evening Dose&#160;:</strong></p>
		<p>75 ml of Condensate only + 6 Apricot Kernels</p>
		<p><strong>PAPAYA SEEDS&#160;:</strong></p>
		<p>Papaya seeds contain agents, which stop the growth and spread of cancer cells and tumours. Papaya seeds contain isothiocyanate, which works well for breast, lung, leukemia and prostate cancer.</p>
		<p>Beginners desirous of taking, papaya seeds need to know that they contain high levels of oleic and palmitic acids. Both are believed to protect the human body against cancer. Hence, they are welcome to take fresh papaya seeds with honey.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Energization</strong></p>
		<p>Energization process of the body is best achieved by having green juice of leafy vegetables, tender mango leaves, tender guava leaves and, citronella grass. Specific green juice prepared from Neem, Bilwa and Tulsi has very good anti-carcinogenic effect.</p>
		<p><strong>GREEN JUICE&#160;:</strong></p>
		<p>NEEM, BILWA and TULSI JUICE TO BE TAKEN ON EMPTY STOMACH EARLY MORNING </p>
		<p>(Blood Purifier HB and Immunity Booster)</p>
		<p>Take 22 leaves each of NEEM and BIL PATRI, and about 15-20 TULSI leaves (preferably Black Tulsi), cut the leaves into small pieces, and add to these GILOY leaves, MANGO leaves, AJWAN leaves, and grind it in a Mixer, with a glass of water. Drink this juice mix every morning on empty stomach.</p>
		<p>This would help in boosting immunity, and ensuring purification of blood. The platelet counts and the RBC levels get raised to a very healthy level, thereby enabling the body to prevent any infection.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>OR</strong></p>
		<p>WHEATGRASS JUICE Before Breakfast:</p>
		<p>(Known as Green Blood)</p>
		<p>Chemotherapy and /or radiation treatment as conventional medicine are known to impact cancer patients severely, with their immunity becoming low, resulting in their vulnerability to infections. Such patients may also suffer from the possibility of easy relapse of cancer. In order to enhance the immunity and improve the quality of blood of cancer patients they have to consider taking Wheatgrass juice daily.</p>
		<p>Wheatgrass is also known as Green Blood, which speedily improves blood quality, while the Haemoglobin count increases considerably.</p>
		<p>This is a home remedy, and wheat grass can be grown at home in small pots. A one week old Green Grass is best for Juice purposes.</p>
		<p><strong>Just how to go about for making wheatgrass juice. </strong></p>
		<p>Take seven small earthen plates or pots, fill fresh soil and sprinkle water to add moisture to the soil and spread a fist full of fresh wheat grains on top. Allow the wheat to grow. On the second day take a second earthen plate or pot and repeat the above procedure. Do this procedure for seven days, and by the seventh day the wheat grass of the first pot is ready for use.</p>
		<p>Cut the grass from the first pot to small pieces, make juice of it in the mixer with a glass of clean water, and consume it on empty stomach. Let this programme continue till the blood count and Hb value improve to normal level. This may take about a month to 45 days. However, as a healthy practice, continue with this process so long as you feel Okay. Wheat grass juice is also good for persons also, who are normal.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, wheat grass powder can be bought from pharmacy shops or organic stores.</p>
		<p>By strictly following these steps and procedures, the cancer affected person is able to satisfactorily complete the <em>HOPE </em>part of <em>HOPE </em>STAR acronym </p>
		<p>However, the cancer patient would have to continue this programme for about three to four months ; monitor the progress and effects related to general improvement in health ; suitability of Protocol Options taken ; changing or altering the Options thereof if required (such as Graviola or Simarouba or Papaya leaves) for any reason whatsoever to suit and adjust the treatment modality. Once the cancer affected person’s body responds favourably to the <em>HOPE </em>part of <em>HOPE </em>STAR acronym, then it paves the way for going ahead with the next step / procedure.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Stabilization</strong></p>
		<p>It is well recognised that the cancer disease adversely impacts the physical, mental and emotional stability of the cancer affected persons. As cancer is a destabilizing factor to those who have undergone or are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, this step or modality of seeking stabilisation is essential for maintaining mental calm. </p>
		<p><em>Spirituality &amp; Yoga are the twin Modality Options contributing to the mental and emotional stability of Cancer Affected Persons</em></p>
		<p><strong>Spirituality </strong></p>
		<p>Spirituality always plays a bigger role in one’s healthy life and even influences end-of-life decisions. It is defined as how one can connect to their sacred God. It is the awareness of something greater than the individual self. It can be understood as one’s relationship with their soul, expressed through one’s attitudes, postures and practices. Spirituality can be understood as the inner life of a person. The deeper you go spiritually, the stronger the patients can go on in fighting serious ailments and more specifically cancer. During the treatment, they can find the meaning of peace and wellness despite fatigue or pain. </p>
		<p>Patients with cancer who had high levels of spiritual well-being reported more enjoyment in life, and higher levels of meaning and peace, even in the midst of cancer-related symptoms such as fatigue or pain. Cancer patients report that their spirituality helps them find hope, gratitude and positivity in their experience, and that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope with life, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of cancer experience as they recover from treatment. One of the greatest gifts of spirituality is learning to love, and fully accepting yourself and others in the present moment. Cancer healing leads to higher feelings of personal growth.</p>
		<p><em>Spiritual practices that may help in coping with cancer and its treatments include:</em></p>
		<p>1. Taking time off regularly to meditate or pray ; 2. Reading spiritual writings and works ; 3. Retreating to spiritual places and natural settings ; 4. Chanting a mantra repeatedly as one of the ways to reach spirituality ; 5. Listening to classical and spiritual music ; </p>
		<p>Holistic practitioners say that spiritual or religious practices can help the patient adjust to the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Patients who rely on their faith tend to experience increased hope and optimism, higher satisfaction with life, freedom from regret, and feelings of inner peace. Spirituality also reduces anxiety, anger and discomfort.</p>
		<p><strong>Yoga</strong></p>
		<p>Yoga typically means ‘union’ between the mind, body and spirit. It involves the practice of physical postures and poses, referred to as ‘asana’ in Sanskrit. As the name suggests, the ultimate aim of practising Yoga is to create a balance between the body and the mind, and to attain self enlightenment. In order to accomplish it, Yoga makes use of asanas, breathing exercises, relaxation techniques and meditation. It brings about emotional stability and clarity of mind. </p>
		<p>Cancer can cause immense stress and distress to a person. The practice of gentle yoga postures helps strengthen the muscles and joints, thus relieving anxiety, stress and fatigue. Relief from this condition of anxiety and stress, along with specific yogic exercises generate positive energy, thus creating a balance between the mind and body. </p>
		<p>Used as an adjunct therapy in managing cancer, yoga helps in effectively clearing out toxins accrued. Yoga asanas stimulate not just muscles, but also increases blood flow, balances the glands and enhances the lymphatic flow in the body, all of which enhances the body’s internal purification processes. The deep relaxing breathing emphasized in yoga also increases the current of oxygen-rich blood to cells. </p>
		<p>While deep breathing exercises help to relax the mind by reducing stress, Yoga Nidra helps to remove the deep-rooted fear. Once the stress begins to reduce, the patient starts feeling positive. </p>
		<p><strong>6. Alkalization&#160;:</strong></p>
		<p>The next step or procedure for the cancer affected person is to develop a conducive climate or condition in the body for Alkalisation. It has to be noted that an alkaline body climate helps and facilitates the cancer patient to ward off any infections attacking the body.</p>
		<p>This is done by maintaining pH level of the cancer patient’s blood and saliva at sufficiently high alkaline level preferably between 7 and 9 values. It is Baking Soda that enables a person to maintain moderate alkaline levels of body fluids, and thereby helps in fighting cancer. </p>
		<p><strong>What is Baking Soda ?</strong></p>
		<p>Baking Soda is a white crystalline solid that appears as fine powder. It is also called cooking soda, bread soda and bicarbonate of soda. Its chemical name is sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate. Baking Soda need not be confused with, or understood as Washing Soda (also chemically called ‘sodium carbonate’) though they have the same salty and alkaline taste. </p>
		<p>The medical uses of baking soda envisage raising pH level of the body by neutralizing acid. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate is used as an antacid (to neutralize stomach acid ; treat ulcer, heartburn and acid indigestion ; and to treat acidosis (raise the pH level of the blood when it is close to 7.0)</p>
		<p><strong>How Baking Soda can Alleviate Cancer</strong></p>
		<p>Principally, malignant tumours represent masses of rapidly growing cells. The rapid rate of growth experienced by these cells means that cellular metabolism also proceeds at very high rates. Therefore, cancer cells are using a lot more carbohydrates and sugars to generate energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Tri-phosphate)</p>
		<p>However, some of the compounds, formed from the energy, release more acid accumulation. Therefore, these organic acids accumulate in the immediate environment of the tumour.</p>
		<p>The high level of extracellular acidity around the tumour is one of the chief driving forces behind metastasis of cancer tumours. Cancer cells need an acidic environment to grow and spread rapidly.</p>
		<p>Some cancer experts, therefore, believe that by buffering the tumour microenvironment with an alkalizing compound, the pH of tumours can be raised enough to starve them as well as stop their growth and spread. This simple solution to cancer has been proven right. A simple, commonly obtained compound like sodium bicarbonate will do.</p>
		<p>The human body has a pH level. And it must be maintained above the neutral level (Between 7.35 and 7.45) at all times for optimum health. But here’s the most amazing part. By keeping the pH above 7, the body then acts as a “cancer treatment” for itself, and goes to work to break down and dispose of any cancerous tumours. </p>
		<p>An acidic pH is known as “Acidosis”. It is an imbalanced acidic condition of all bodily fluids. Almost all cellular functions in the body are sensitive to the pH of their fluids. If the pH falls too far to the acidic side, the cells become poisoned in their own toxic wastes and will die. Many studies show that people with a correct blood pH enjoy good health ; whereas people with a low or acidic pH are more likely to be ill. The slightest imbalance can cause serious illness and disease. Acidosis can result in rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, lupus, tuberculosis, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and <em>most cancers.</em></p>
		<p>Baking Soda or Sodium Bicarbonate alkalizes the body very quickly, and even more importantly for cancer sufferers, it alkalizes cancer cells. This kills the microbes inside cancerous cells, which in turn kills the cancer. </p>
		<p>To make the baking soda a natural cancer anti dote, all you need to do is to mix Honey with Baking Soda, according to Dr. Mark Sircus, an authority on Natural Allopathic Medicine, as described in his publication “Dr. Sircus’s Treatment Essentials Book”.</p>
		<p>Ideally, cancer affected persons should consult an Oncologist with the knowledge of this remedy before adopting the baking soda solution. </p>
		<p><strong>7. Relaxation</strong></p>
		<p>Doctors attending, treating or counselling cancer patients usually and commonly tell them to take adequate rest, as part of medical advice or instructions tendered. This requirement of rest or relaxation is essential, as cancer patients invariably suffer from acute fatigue and pain besides experiencing side effects of conventional treatment.</p>
		<p>Thus, relaxation or rest is an elixir for the body, the mind and the spirit. It is the single most important key to health and well being of patients, and more so of cancer affected persons. When we relax, our body has opportunity to unwind. The benefits of relaxation or rest have been well researched, and some of these are as well as here below&#160;:</p>
		<p>Relaxation i) Increases blood flow to muscles ; ii) Gives the heart a rest by slowing the heart rate ; iii) Reduces blood pressure ; iv) Slows the rate of breathing, which reduces the need for oxygen ; v) Decreases muscular tension.</p>
		<p>Meditation is a powerful tool for relaxation.</p>
		<p>Adequate rest or sleep is a must cancer patients. A minimum of 6 hours of undisturbed sleep during the night, and 2 hours of rest in the day are essential for deriving benefits from relaxation. Remember, rest calms the nerves.</p>
		<p>As a result of relaxation, many people experience&#160;: more energy ; better sleep ; enhanced immunity ; increased concentration ; smoother emotions -- less anger, crying, anxiety and frustration.</p>
		<p><em>Consuming dates on a regular basis helps in achieving this easily. Two dates taken before sleep work better than sleeping pills. This will be the minimum intake of dates every day for the cancer affected person.</em></p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 3</span>Health Benefits of Dravyas (Medicinal Herbs and Spices) as Additives in the Protocols under <em>Hopestar</em> MANTRA </h1>
		<p><strong>These are the Additives used in the preparation of the Condensate and Decoctions in the Protocols. They work as accelerators and facilitators for the improved efficacy of the decoctions. It is relevant to note that each of the additive is anti-carcinogenic specific.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>TURMERIC AND GINGER</strong></p>
		<p>Turmeric is derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, and is a primary ingredient found in curry powders that are used to season foods in the Middle East and Asian countries, namely, India. Accumulating evidence reveals that this brightly coloured relative of Ginger is also a powerful disease-preventive and cancer fighting agent as well.</p>
		<p>One of the most comprehensive summaries of turmeric studies to date has been published in the Journal of The Alternative &amp; Complementary Therapies, by respected Ethnobotanist Dr. James. A. Duke. In reviewing some 700 studies, he concluded that Turmeric appears to outperform many drugs in its effects against several chronic and debilitating diseases, with virtually no adverse side effects. Studies show that maintenance dose for Curcumin is 400-600 mg. daily, and as such Turmeric Powder can be mixed with the Decoction during the boiling stage, which will act as carrier for turmeric into human system.</p>
		<p>Ginger, a spice of super anti-cancer substance, is known for its ability to shrink tumours. Surprisingly, it is even more effective than many cancer drugs, which are known to be completely ineffective and actually accelerate the end of cancer patients. Commonly consumed across the world in small doses in food and beverage products, the medicinal properties of ginger surpass even advanced drugs.</p>
		<p>A specific protocol has been of mixing ¼ tsp Ginger Powder, and ½ tsp Turmeric with the decoction, which taken every day in the morning on empty stomach acts as an effective cancer anti dote.</p>
		<p><strong>CUMIN SEEDS (Jeera)</strong></p>
		<p>Cumin is helpful in treating various types of Cancers, and it is known to be effective in Colon as well as Breast Cancers. The Cumin Seeds contain thymoquinone, dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone and thymol, which are anti-carcinogenic agents.</p>
		<p>Metabolism is effectively controlled by consuming cumin seeds regularly. Good metabolism helps in keeping body process in check. Iron content in cumin helps to maintain metabolic activity.</p>
		<p><strong>GARCINIA INDICA (Kokum)</strong></p>
		<p><em>Garcinia Indica</em> is the botanical name of Kokum, which is an ornate fruit of India. Kokum fruit trees are native to the Western Ghats region, and they are widely used as spice in food preparations, and as source of medicine in pharmaceuticals. The dried rind of Kokum fruit is used as a medicinal and culinary agent. The different parts of Kokum Tree such as the bark, rind, pulp, juice, root and seeds have numerous health benefits and are utilized in many ayurvedic preparations. Kokum is a purple berry which has been long used in Ayurveda to prevent infections, treat sores, cure ear infections, heal stomach ulcers, improve digestion, lessen arthritis pain and alleviate diarrhoea and constipation.</p>
		<p>Garcenol is a major active ingredient of Kokum, and it has antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. It does not contain cholesterol or saturated fats. Garcenol inhibits growth of intestinal cancer cells without affecting the normal cells. It also aids in preventing Skin, Liver, Colon, Breast and Tongue Cancer. </p>
		<p><strong>SPIRULINA </strong></p>
		<p>Spirulina is presently available in the form of capsules, and has to be taken along with the PROTOCOL Options.</p>
		<p>Spirulina is a naturally occurring Blue-Green algae that grows in high alkaline warm water lakes. Its blue-green colour is the result of Phycocyanin, a protein that has been shown to inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Spirulina, like most plants and algae, also contains high level of chlorophyll. Recent studies have shown that chlorophyll binds with cancer cells, allowing them to be easily excreted from the body. Thereby, it eliminates cancerous cells before they can group into colonies and develop into tumours or spread to other parts of the body. Spirulina is also a rich source of Vitamin B 12 and Beta Carotene, as well as other minerals and fatty acids which aid in the fight against cancer.</p>
		<p>Vitamins and Minerals in Spirulina help to boost the immune system, allowing it to effectively deal with cancer cells, as they appear in the body, thus reducing their chances of multiplying and developing.</p>
		<p>Spirulina is available at Pharmacy and Ayurveda Products Shops as also with Organic Stores. These apart, VRL (Transport &amp; Logistics) Outlets in Karnataka provide Spirulina at subsidized rates.</p>
		<p><strong>GOMUTRA (Cow Urine)</strong></p>
		<p>Cow Urine (GOMUTRA) is a natural antiseptic, and in Ayurveda it is known as “Sanjivini”. It has several medicinal properties, and is known to be effective in treating a large number of diseases and infections, especially those of kidneys and liver. Gomutra cleanses the system of toxins, and acts as an antidote protecting the body from various toxins. </p>
		<p><strong>Medicinal Properties &amp; Laboratory Analysis of Gomutra</strong></p>
		<p>Laboratory analyses of cow urine have shown that it contains nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate, sodium, manganese, carbolic acid, iron, silicon, chlorine, magnesium, lactose, melci, citric, titric, succenic, calcium salts, Vitamins A, B, C, D and E, minerals, lactose, enzymes, creatinine, hormones, and gold acids --- all of which are needed in smaller quantities for the human body to balance the Tridosha Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Our body contains many micronutrients that give us strength for life. Whenever we urinate, these micronutrients are flushed out of our bodies. Cow urine meets the deficiency of these micronutrients in the body. It maintains balance of these substances in our body, and addresses effectively the diseases, which are typically non-curable.</p>

		<p><strong>BITTER APRICOT KERNELS</strong></p>
		<p>Apricot Seed was claimed as the answer to all cancers 40 years ago. It was even strongly claimed that by eating apricot seeds every day, one can never develop cancer, just as one can never get scurvy if one takes an orange a day. </p>
		<p>VITAMIN - B - 17&#160;: RESEARCH STUDY</p>
		<p>Dr. Ernest T. Krebs, Jr. is a bio Chemist and researcher who first isolated Laetrile (Vitamin B17) in Apricot seeds, and also discovered Vitamin B-17 (Pangamic acid, a vitamin which has proven to be an important adjunct therapy in the treatment of ailments related to circulation)</p>
		<p>After years of study, research and testing, he was convinced of the therapeutic value of Laetrile. To prove that it was not toxic to humans he injected it into his own arm. As he anticipated, there was no harmful or distressing side effects. Laetrile had no harmful effect on normal cells, but was deadly on cancer cells.</p>
		<p>Apricot seeds are known to contain virtual Cyanide. Although Laetrile or B- 17 is less toxic than sugar, and 21 times less toxic than aspirin, one can take only limited dosage, lest it becomes harmful or risky to life. So, to question the use of Vitamin B-17 on the grounds of toxicity is academic and uncalled for, as all the drugs used in conventional medicine for cancer treatment are extremely toxic.</p>
		<p>HOW LAETRILE WORKS ON CANCER </p>
		<p>Cancer loves sugar. The sugar in the Apricot seeds surrounds cyanide. Cancer draws sugar, consumes it, and releases the cyanide at the cancer cell- and only at the cancer cell&#160;: something akin to a smart bomb. The problem with this is that some people take too much.</p>
		<p>One needs to monitor the dosage of apricots carefully, or the care giver should closely observe when the patient is on apricot treatment. If the apricots are taken in excess, then it may cause loose motion, diarrhoea and dehydration. The moment symptoms of loose motion appear, then slightly reduce the dosage and maintain at this level for a few days ; then gradually increase it so that the cancer patient becomes used to the dosage. One has to allow the body to get acclimatised to Laetrile.</p>
		<p>There is no “free” hydrogen cyanide in Laetrile. When Laetrile comes in contact with the enzyme betaglycosidase, it is broken down into two molecules of glucose&#160;: one molecule of benzaldihyde, and one molecule of hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Within the body, the cancer cell - and only the cancer cell – contains the enzyme betaglycosidase essential to trigger the molecular break down.</p>
		<p>Key to this process is formation of HCN, as it is not floating around freely in the Laetrile and then released. Thus, HCN has to be formed, which can happen only by the reaction between Laetrile and Enzyme Betaglycosidase. It must be noted that Beta Glycosidase enzyme is present only around cancer cells, and not with normal healthy cells. For formation of HCN, the Laetrile must come in contact with the cover layer of cancer cell. And once this happens, the Beta glycosidase cover bursts, and exposes the cell surface which gets destroyed when HCN comes in contact. Thus, the death of cancer cell takes place. This is the target killing function of Laetrile or Bitter Apricot Kernels. When there is no scope or possibility of the Laetrile coming into contact with the Enzyme Betaglycosidase, and no HCN can be formed, the Apricot is digested by the user, and the vitamin present in the Kernels helps in improving the person’s general health. Thus, Apricot simply functions as dry fruit in such cases of consumption by normal persons, without having any adverse effect.</p>
		<p>To start with, it is recommended that the cancer patient eat one Apricot for every 10 lb of body weight per day. This requirement of consuming Apricot has to be distributed throughout the day, say three times&#160;: before Breakfast ; before Lunch ; and before Dinner.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="num">Chapter 4</span>Transforming Health and Life of Cancer Affected Persons with Healing Foods &amp; Immunity Boosters</h1>
		<p>While the Hopestar MANTRA enables and empowers you to alleviate, manage and overcome the impact of cancer, let us now look at foods that can transform the Health and Life of Cancer Affected Persons so that they remain healthy and feel good for long.</p>
		<p>It is a scientific proven fact that our food choices affect and determine our health. The proverbial old saying ‘We are what we eat’ is true, and it is ultimately that matters. Every cell in our body is created from the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. In addition to nourishing our body, healing foods such as millet foods specific contribute to the quality of our lives, our appearance, moods, energy, weight and our overall health and well-being. </p>
		<p><strong>MILLET FOODS</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Millets have Medicinal Value &amp; Therapeutic Benefits</strong></p>
		<p>Among the healing foods, millets are one of the oldest foods known to humans, and possibly the first cereal grain to be used for domestic consumption. They are drought resistant crops grown in dry land, and are known to be cultivated thousand of years ago in Asia. While grains are classified as Positive, Neutral and Negative, the Millet range of grains constitute as Positive and Neutral grains. Among the Positive Millet Grains, which have dietary fibre from 8 % to 12.5 %, are Foxtail (Navane) ; Barnyard (Oodalu) ; Arka (Kodo) ; Little (Samai) ; and Brown Top (Korale). Whereas Millets / Grains, viz., Pearl (Sajje) ; Finger (Ragi) ; Proso (Baragu) ; Great Millet (White Jowar) ; and Corn / Maize (Mekke Jowar) are called neutral grains, having lesser fibre and other nutrients. </p>
		<p><strong>Table below provides the nutrient contents of various millets and grains&#160;:</strong></p>
		<figure class="img-center">
			<img src="images/008.jpg" alt="images" />
		</figure>
		<p>Unlike grains such as rice, wheat and jowar, the millet grains are nutritionally superior to many cereals, and have medicinal value because of high fibre content and higher amount of protein, including all essential amino acids. Besides, millets have less carbohydrates compared to rice and wheat. Due to its inherent low glycemic value, millets are ideal for combating cancer and other lifestyle diseases.</p>
		<p>Traditionally, most millets are used in the form of rice and rice dishes,. The millet grains can be used in the preparation of roti, pulao, dosa, idli, upma, and a variety of Indian vegetarian dishes.</p>
		<p>Most of the ailments and diseases plaguing our society today can be addressed and drastically reduced with specific nutrition available in millet foods, which are the healing foods. Millet range of grains are so important because of its uniquely high content of nutrients, including impressive starch levels, very high B Vitamin content, as well as iron, calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, not to mention of its being a healthy source of essential fats in the body. Furthermore, there are significant levels of protein and dietary fibre in these millets. </p>
		<p>Dr. D. Khadar, Scientist and Food Researcher, Mysore is an authority on Millet Foods, that are considered as Miracle Grains, and he describes them as ‘Siridhanya’ Millets. As a Crusader of Millet Foods, he is currently spearheading a campaign for revival and propagation of Millets Foods that can, and is able to, transform the health of our people, society and country. </p>
		<p><strong>Vegetable &amp; Fruit Juice </strong></p>
		<p>Beetroot, Carrot &amp; Apple Juices form a powerful, effective and therapeutic Drink Specific against Cancer </p>
		<p>Several cancer types can be prevented and contained by using natural resources, especially taking or drinking juices of particular fruits and vegetables. Beet root contains carotenoids and is a good source of folic acid, aside from its anti-cancer properties. This root-vegetable has an abundance of anti-oxidants, which protect our organs from free radicals ; insulate from premature aging ; and help fight several and different diseases. If you combine beetroot with carrot and apple to make  a health drink, you may rest assured that your body will be able to remove free radicals since the entire contents are loaded with anti-oxidants and anti-cancer properties.</p>
		<p><strong>Preparation Method:</strong></p>
		<p>Place the beetroot in a blender or mixer and grind it. Pour the beet root juice extract in a glass cup or tumbler, and let it be kept in the fridge for an hour. Thereafter, add the carrot and apple juices in the beet root juice. This powerful juice drink is ideal for strengthening the immune system, and for preventing and fighting cancer and kidney diseases. Drink it once a day, before breakfast for best results. </p>
		<p><strong>GARLIC </strong></p>
		<p>Garlic is a vegetable <em>(Allium Sativum) </em>that belongs to the allium class of Bulb shaped plants, which also includes onions, chives, leeks and scallions. Garlic is used for flavouring in cooking, and is unique because of its high sulphur content. In addition to sulphur, garlic also contains arginine, oligosaccharides, flavonoids and selenium, all of which may be beneficial to health.</p>
		<p>The characteristic odour and flavour of garlic comes from the sulphur compounds of allicin, a major precursor of garlic’s bioactive compounds, which are formed when garlic bulbs are chopped, crushed, or damaged. Bioactive compounds are defined as substances in foods or dietary supplements, other than those needed to meet the basic nutritional needs that are responsible for changes in health status.</p>
		<p><strong>Studies reported reduction in the risk of developing Cancer of different types with Garlic use</strong></p>
		<p>1. Studies observed that garlic consumption may reduce the risk of developing several types of cancer, especially cancers of the gastro- intestinal tract. Most of the studies evaluated different types of garlic preparations, and used them in varying amounts.</p>
		<p>2. If garlic consumption does reduce the risk of developing cancer, the amount needed to lower risk remains unknown.</p>
		<p>3. Although usual garlic consumption rarely causes problems, higher intakes can cause side effects, including gastrointestinal distress.</p>
		<p><strong>Findings from various Studies indicate that Garlic Use and Consumption reduces the Risk of Different Cancers </strong></p>
		<p>An analysis of data from several studies showed that the higher the amount of raw and cooked garlic consumed, the lower the risk of stomach and colorectal cancers.</p>
		<p>Findings from one study showed strong association between garlic consumption and colon cancer risk. Women who consumed highest amount of garlic had a 50 % lower risk of cancer of the distal colon compared with women who had the lowest level of garlic consumption. Likewise, it was observed that increased garlic consumption may reduce pancreatic cancer risk, and was 54 % lower in people who ate larger amounts of garlic compared to those who ate lower amounts. </p>
		<p>Further, a study in France found that increased garlic consumption was associated with a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer risk. Clinical trials in China also indicate that garlic consumption reduces the risk of incidence of many types of Cancer.</p>
		<p>The World Health Organization’s guidelines for general health promotion for adults among others is a daily dose of 2.5 g of fresh garlic ; 0.40 to 1.020 g of dried garlic powder ; 2 to 5 mg of garlic oil ; 300 to 1000 mg of garlic extract or other formulations that are equally effective.</p>
