		<p>On the first Sunday when Nandita entered her study, she encountered a group of bright, enthusiastic youngsters. All were Raju’s close friends. All of them knew that they had a mission to make things better but didn’t quite know how to go about it.</p>
		<p>Nandita settled in her chair and looked around. ‘Hello, everybody. In the first place, let me tell you how much I appreciate your enthusiasm and concern for your fellow students. If we want to better the quality of our life, we need to understand what we call ‘life skills’. I’ve given a list of concepts we need to be clear about so that we can go ahead’. She paused.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, any skill that is useful in your life can be considered a ‘life skill’. Right from birth, the child learns many things like learning to eat, putting on clothes, tying shoe laces, taking care of appearance and so on. All these may be called personal skills. Personal skills also include how to control emotions, anger, stress, and to have self-esteem and confidence in ourselves. Parents teach us how to speak when we are amidst people, how to behave with elders and others. All these are called social skills. Apart from these, when we are students we need to develop academic skills or study skills as well as time management’. Nandita looked at the earnest faces. </p>
		<p>She smiled and said, ‘In the first place we need to develop willingness to learn. Then, we need to develop professional skills like decision making, team spirit and leadership. If you learn these when you are a student it will help you when you are employed’.</p>
		<p>Hemant said, ‘So, it is learning and learning all the time!’</p>
		<p>Nandita smiled. ‘That’s right. Life is a great teacher. People learn from various experiences. We can also learn from others’ experiences’.</p>
		<p>Raju asked, ‘Where do we start? There’s a lot to know’.</p>
		<p>Nandita said, ‘OK. If you have understood what’s involved in life skills, let’s move on. First, let’s talk about self-esteem’. She continued.</p>
		<p>‘Self-esteem is about how we perceive and value ourselves. We should understand that unless we perceive ourselves as ‘good’ we cannot do anything well enough. We should know what we are capable of and should believe in ourselves’.</p>
		<p>Raju said, ‘My teacher in school used to say ‘we should respect ourselves first to get others to respect us’.</p>
		<p>‘Very true’. Nandita agreed.</p>
		<p>Anjali said, ‘Ah, I remember a Chinese story my teacher told me when I was in school. I like it a lot. Can I narrate it now?’</p>
		<p>‘Sure Anjali, go ahead’.</p>
		<p>‘So, I think it is a good beginning. We don’t have to wait for Saturday’. Amina clapped her hands.</p>
		<p>Anjali began the story...</p>
		<p><em>A water bearer in China had two pots, each hung on the ends of a pole which he carried across his shoulders. One of the pots had a crack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water. At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water to his house. Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream... </em></p>
		<p><em>‘I am ashamed of myself, because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The bearer said to the pot, ‘Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot’s side? That’s because I have always known about your flaw and I planted flower seeds on your side of the path. Every day while we walk back, you’ve watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house’.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali concluded the story.</p>
		<p>‘Beautiful. This pot had a low self-esteem. The farmer had to boost its self-esteem. Once we know our worth, then we can enjoy life and also contribute meaningfully to the society’. Nandita commented and continued. </p>
		<p>‘Low self-esteem leads to inferiority complex, self-doubt and anxiety. We torture ourselves with doubts, fail to assert ourselves when situation demands, punish ourselves or blame others for misfortunes. This may cause an abnormal emotional state called ‘depression’ that affects our thinking, emotions, perceptions and behaviour in pervasive and chronic ways. This in turn sometimes takes us to alcoholism and drugs and even drives us to commit suicide’. Nandita said. ‘I remember a small Sanskrit verse that I would like all of us to learn and recite.</p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>Amantram aksharam nasti</em><br />
			<em>Nasti moolam unaushadham</em><br />
			<em>Ayogyah purusho nasti</em><br />
			<em>Yojakah tatra durlabhah.</em>
		</p>
		<p>The meaning is, there is no letter in which a mantra is not embedded; no herb is devoid of medicinal values and no human being is completely useless. In fact, it is rare to find something in this world which is completely useless’.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, that’s why we always recycle things and find new use for the same thing in a different shape. Prime Minister Modi once said that we as a nation are great at recycling things in our day to day life – a sari once worn out is transformed into a quilt and a worn-out quilt is used as a rag to mop the house..’. Swapna said with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘Oh! I have a Buddha story to illustrate this. Somebody sent this to me on WhatsApp’. Anjali said and scrolled her mobile phone screen to read it aloud. Everyone wondered what the Buddha would have said about recycling.</p>
		<p><em>A disciple of Buddha, said, ‘Oh Master! I have a request to make’.Buddha: ‘What is it? Tell me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: ‘My robe is worn out. It is no longer decent enough to wear. Please, may I have a new one?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha looked at the disciple’s attire and found that the garment was absolutely in tatters and really needed replacement. So, he asked the store-keeper to give a new robe to this disciple.</em></p>
		<p><em>The disciple offered obeisance to the great master and left the room.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha kept thinking about the incident and felt that he had perhaps missed an opportunity to teach a valuable lesson to the disciple. So, he went to the disciple’s quarters to talk to him. Buddha: Are you comfortable in your new robe? Do you need anything else?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: Thank you Master. I am very comfortable and do not need anything else.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha: Now that you have a new one, what have you done with the old one?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: I have used it to replace my worn out bedspread.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha: What did you do with the old bedspread?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: Master, I am using it as a curtain on my window.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha: Did you discard your old window curtain?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: Master, I tore it into four pieces and am using them as napkins to handle the hot pots and pans in the kitchen.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha: What about the old kitchen napkins?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: We are using them as mops to wash and wipe the floor.</em></p>
		<p><em>Buddha: Where is the old mop?</em></p>
		<p><em>Disciple: Lord, the old mop was so tattered that the best we could do was to take all the threads apart and make wicks for your oil lamp. One of them is presently lit in your room’. Buddha was contented. He was happy that his disciples realized that nothing is useless. We can find a use for everything, if only we want to! Nothing should be wasted; not even time!</em></p>
		<p>Amina added, ‘Attitude to one’s self matters a lot, I think. That’s why sometimes we are asked to spell out our strengths and weaknesses’.</p>
		<p>‘Well, I think it’s a good beginning. We have already had two stories with us’. Nandita asked the group to look for more stories that can boost one’s self esteem.</p>
		<p>They brought their stories on Saturday.</p>
		<p>These are the stories. The first one was read out by Ashish.</p>
		<p><em>Viresh didn’t understand why his ayya was against selling away the previous year’s textbooks, even the tattered notebooks to the trash dealer.</em></p>
		<p><em>The eight-year-old Viresh was studying in class IV now. His father Obulayya was a rickshaw puller. When a son was born he named him ‘Viresalingam’ after the great social reformer and writer. He had seen the statues of great people on the Tank bund. There were several statues of great people there in Hyderabad. One day a gentleman who took a ride in his rickshaw told him the greatness of Viresalingam, how he fought several evils in the society and how he tried to bring about a change in the people through his powerful writings. That day Obulayya decided that if ever he had a son he would call him Viresalingam and educate him to become a writer.</em></p>
		<p><em>Obulayya worked hard so that he could save enough money to put his son in a good school. When Viresh was five, his father took him to the nearby school. A form had to be filled. The illiterate Obulayya didn’t know what to do. He hesitatingly asked the clerk there to fill it up for him.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Can you at least sign your name?’ the clerk asked him. Obulayya shook his head in the negative. That day the look on his son’s face made him long for the earth to open up and swallow him.</em></p>
		<p><em>When his son passed his first class, Obulayya preserved the book. The book would be taken out in the dim light later in the night, after his son had long gone to bed. His wife would turn the other side and pretend not to look. She would soon fall asleep.</em></p>
		<p><em>Viresh completed fifth class. It was time for him to quit that school and go to a bigger school, a little farther away.</em></p>
		<p><em>He was older and taller now.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Ayya, I’m going to school to get the form. My teacher asked me to take it to him so that he can fill it up for you’. Saying this, his son ran out.</em></p>
		<p><em>Obulayya got up and followed his son silently.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Give it to me’ he said when his saw the form in his son’s hand.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘But... ayya..’. the boy was puzzled.</em></p>
		<p><em>Obulayya took the form, took out a pen from his faded trouser pocket. He started reading each sentence slowly and carefully. He filled the dotted lines slowly and meticulously.</em></p>
		<p><em>Viresh’s eyes were wide with amazement and pride. His little head could now understand why his ayya didn’t want to discard his used books!</em></p>
		<p>Everybody clapped when Ashish concluded the story. ‘Wow! when you respect yourself you can also do things which will command respect from others’. Tejas commented.</p>
		<p>Anjali took out a sheet of paper and said ‘I am going to read this story first and then you can offer your comments’. She began her story.</p>
		<p><em>One day, a merchant was passing through a riverside. He saw a mahout had tied a huge elephant to a pole with a thin rope. The merchant was amused by this. He called the mahout and said, ‘Looks like you no longer want this elephant of yours. It will break the rope and run away anytime now’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The mahout smiled and said, ‘I need this elephant more than ever. I am going to get some wood from the jungle. I bet you that it will be still here when I come back’. The merchant was surprised by the mahout’s confidence and decided to stay and watch the mahout make a fool of himself. He knew the elephant would break rope the moment the mahout was out of sight.</em></p>
		<p><em>A few hours passed by and the elephant did not make any attempt to break free. The mahout returned and found his elephant still tied and the merchant looking perplexed.</em></p>
		<p><em>The merchant asked the mahout, ‘What sort of trick is this? Why did the elephant not break the rope?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Because the rope is not around the foot of the elephant, it is in the mind of the elephant,’ said the mahout. ‘You see, I used the same rope to tie the elephant when it was a young calf. Several times it tried to break the rope and run away. It failed all the time. Now, even though the elephant is bigger and stronger, its mind believes that the rope is unbreakable’.</em></p>
		<p>‘The elephant had a mindset’ Tejas commented. </p>
		<p>‘Sometimes we are bound by our own fears and beliefs. We fail to understand our own potential and ability. We develop a low self-esteem. Like the elephant we surrender to the situation. Then we won’t be able to perform’.</p>
		<p>‘So, in such situations we need somebody to tell us, wake us up, like Jambavan did to Hanuman’. Raju grinned recalling his aunt’s story.</p>
		<p>‘This story reminds me what my father once told me when I was teased by my friends in my new school. It’s a small story’. Hemant briefly narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In the room of 200, he asked. ‘Who would like this $20 bill?’ Hands started going up. He said, ‘I am going to give this $20 to one of you - but first, let me do this’. He proceeded to crumple the $20 note up. He then asked. ‘Who still wants it?’ Still the hands were up in the air. ‘Well,’ he replied, ‘what if I do this?’He dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. ‘Now, who still wants it?’ </em></p>
		<p><em>Still the hands went up.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times, in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless; but no matter what happens, you will never lose your value’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you. The worth of our lives comes, not in what we do or who we know, but by ... WHO WE ARE.</em></p>
		<p>‘If we remember this story we will never feel low but will get adequate courage to face any problem’. Raju said with a smile.</p>
		<p>Anjali came up with another story. ‘I think how we look at ourselves matters a lot in life. Just listen to this story someone sent me on WhatsApp’. She read the story to the group.</p>
		<p><em>Maria lived with her mother in a small apartment. </em></p>
		<p><em>She wasn’t too young or too old, not too short or too tall, not particularly beautiful nor ugly. She was just an average woman. She worked as a secretary at a large company and her life was pretty much boring and mundane. </em></p>
		<p><em>No one at workplace paid any attention to her. Those that did, considered her to be as boring as her life was. </em></p>
		<p><em>One morning, on her way to work, Maria saw a new hat shop that opened down the street. </em></p>
		<p><em>Out of curiosity she walked in!</em></p>
		<p><em>In the shop there was a little girl and her mother who came to pick the girl a hat and another customer who was trying on hats.</em></p>
		<p><em>Maria also tried on a few hats, until she found one she liked. She put it on and it looked nice!</em></p>
		<p><em>The little girl was the first one to notice: ‘Mommy, look how pretty that woman looks with the hat on!’</em></p>
		<p><em>The mother said:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Ma’am, I must say, this hat just looks wonderful on you!’</em></p>
		<p><em>The second buyer also came to look and said: ‘Ma’am, you look lovely with that hat on!’</em></p>
		<p><em>Maria went to the mirror. She looked at herself and for the first time in her adult life, she liked what she saw. Smiling, she went to the counter and bought the hat. </em></p>
		<p><em>As she walked outside, a new world revealed itself to her. </em></p>
		<p><em>She had never before noticed the colours of the flower, or the scent of the fresh air.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sound of the cars and the people sounded like a harmonious melody.</em></p>
		<p><em>She walked as if she was drifting on a cloud, with a song in her heart.</em></p>
		<p><em>When she passed by the coffee shop she walked by every morning, one of the young handsome man called out to her: ‘Hey darling…looking good! Are you new here? </em></p>
		<p><em>Can I buy you a cup of coffee?’</em></p>
		<p><em>She smiled shyly and kept walking, floating on cloud nine.</em></p>
		<p><em>When she got to the office building, the doorman opened the door and wished her ‘Good Morning’. Never before had he even noticed her!</em></p>
		<p><em>The people in the elevator asked her the floor she needed and pressed the button for her.</em></p>
		<p><em>The people at the office, as if seeing her for the first time, flattered her on how lovely she looked that day. The manager asked her out to lunch to talk about how she felt at work!</em></p>
		<p><em>When this magical workday was over, she decided to take a cab home instead of the bus. </em></p>
		<p><em>As soon as she put her hand up two taxis stopped!</em></p>
		<p><em>She took the first one and sat in the back seat. Thinking about the miraculous day she had and how her life changed!! Thanks to the new hat!</em></p>
		<p><em>When she got home, her mom opened the door. The sight of Maria took her breath away!</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Maria’ she said surprised ‘How beautiful you look! Your eyes are all lit up like when you were a little girl!’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Yes, mother ‘said Maria ‘It’s all thanks to my new hat, I had a most marvelous day!’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Maria’ said her mother ‘What hat??’</em></p>
		<p><em>Maria panicked.</em></p>
		<p><em>She touched her head and saw that the hat that changed her life was not there. She didn’t remember taking it off in the cab, or at lunch, or at the office…</em></p>
		<p><em>She thought back to the store where she had bought it, how she noticed it for the first time, she put it on, paying for it at the cashier’s... And she remembered painfully now. How she put it on the counter, to get her purse out to pay, and how she forgot the hat right there, on the counter...then she walked out to the street…</em></p>
		<p><em>Hat-less yet glowing!</em></p>
		<p><em>It wasn’t the hat that freed Maria, it was the quality of her thoughts!</em></p>
		<p>‘What a beautiful story!’ exclaimed Swapna. ‘If we have the right attitude towards ourselves we can be much better off’. </p>
		<p>Everyone agreed with her.</p>
		<p>Anjali was pleased that everyone appreciated her story.</p>
