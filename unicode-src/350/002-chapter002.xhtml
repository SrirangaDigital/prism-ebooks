		<p>Nandita looked very ‘cool’ in her beige colour sari that Sunday when the group met her. ‘Self-esteem is how we look at ourselves. All of us live in this society and we encounter people and situations day in and day out. Our surroundings invoke certain emotions in us which result in our behaviour in the society, towards people and situations. The interesting fact is that these emotions are controlled by what we call our ‘beliefs’ or ‘attitudes’. In the course of our life, we develop attitudes towards our surroundings, people and life in general. Attitudes can be positive or negative. Negative attitude results in making us, as well as people around us unhappy. If we take things positively we can cope with everything that comes our way easily. The next topic we are going to discuss is ‘positive attitude’. I would like us to begin with a small task’. Nandita took out a sheet of paper. All of them read the instructions.</p>
		<img src="images/LifeSutrasTakingaPers_fmt1.jpg" alt="images" />
		<p>Anjali was the quickest to give the answers. ‘Hard work is 98 Knowledge is 96 and attitude is 100 percent’.</p>
		<p>‘So, what we can conclude is, though hard work and knowledge do contribute a lot to success it is the attitude which matters’ Nandita commented.</p>
		<p>‘I can understand this. Unless we have the right attitude we neither work hard nor do we make an effort to acquire knowledge’. Raju said. </p>
		<p>Tejas asked, ‘How does one develop positive attitude?’</p>
		<p>‘Well, positive attitude manifests in your thinking, let us say, in your creative and constructive thinking. Also, it helps in developing optimism, to be motivated to accomplish goals. In general, it gives happiness, spreads happiness’. Nandita paused.</p>
		<p>‘Is it like looking at a glass of water and saying whether it is half full or half empty?’ Ashish grinned.</p>
		<p>‘Hmm, yes. This is a very common example we take to illustrate attitude’. Nandita said.</p>
		<p>‘So, our attitude is responsible for giving us confidence in our abilities to solve problems’. Raju observed.</p>
		<p>‘Absolutely. It includes attitude to self, attitude towards others which is responsible for the interpersonal relationship, attitude towards profession and attitude towards change. In a way our attitude helps in our career and shapes our life’. Nandita affirmed.</p>
		<p>‘Aren’t we born with our attitudes? Can we ‘develop’ attitude or change it?’ Swapna expressed her doubt.</p>
		<p>‘Well, it is a part of our personality. But there is always a scope to change our attitude. Exposure to life, reading good literature, learning from great people and how they have dealt with problems—all these certainly help us develop a positive attitude’. Nandita concluded the discussion with one more piece of information.</p>
		<p>‘Do you know that at Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the most popular and successful course teaches you how to learn to be happier? The Positive Psychology class taught by Tal Ben Shahar attracts 1400 students per semester and 20% of Harvard graduates take this elective course. This course is about the psychological aspects of life fulfilment and flourishing, by teaching about empathy, friendship, love, achievement, creativity, spirituality, happiness and humour. According to Tal Ben Shahar, the class - which focuses on happiness, self-esteem and motivation - gives students the tools to succeed and face life with more joy. He said, ‘Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness, therefore, is not about making it to the peak of the mountain, nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain: happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak’ </p>
		<p>‘He also gave five positive tips that work in building happiness. They are: </p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>accept painful emotions </em></li>
			<li><em>spend quality time with people we love and care for</em></li>
			<li><em>do physical exercise</em></li>
			<li><em>cultivate the habit of gratitude</em></li>
			<li><em>simplify, do less work and increase the quality of work that will enhance productivity.</em> </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Nandita handed over copies of the five tips to them and said, ‘You may go through it leisurely and reflect on how you can implement them in your life’.</p>
		<p>‘Wow! Wonderful tips. I wonder whether I can follow all of them’. Ashish said glancing through the tips.</p>
		<p>‘If we take ourselves and our happiness seriously we should try’. Anjali said wisely.</p>
		<p>‘OK. Now I think we have understood what positive attitude is. Let’s look for suitable stories’. With these words Raju got up. Others took the cue and thanked Nandita for her time before they dispersed.</p>
		<p>On Saturday when they met there were quite a few stories that were read out. Swapna read hers first.</p>
		<p><em>There was a King who offered a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture of peace. Many artists tried. The King looked at all the pictures but there were only two he really liked and he had to choose between them.</em></p>
		<p><em>One picture was of a calm lake. The lake was a perfect mirror for peaceful towering mountains were all around it. Overhead was the blue sky with fluffy white clouds. All who saw this picture thought that it was a perfect picture of peace. </em></p>
		<p><em>The other picture had mountains too. But they were rugged and bare. Above was an angry sky from which rain fell, in which lightening played. Down the side of the mountain tumbled a foaming waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all.</em></p>
		<p><em>But when the King looked, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird in her nest....</em></p>
		<p><em>The King chose the second picture.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Because,’ explained the King, ‘peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart. That is the real meaning of peace’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Well, I like this story. It sends the message very strongly that we should have a positive attitude towards life, especially when there are troubles galore. If we can find peace amid chaos, life becomes easier to live’.</p>
		<p>Though the story sounded a bit philosophical everyone agreed that it could be displayed on the notice board. </p>
		<p>Ashish said, ‘I found a story which is almost on similar lines. This is a story of a very old person. Let us hear what he tells us’. He started reading out. </p>
		<p><em>A man of 92 years, short, very well-presented, who takes great care in his appearance, is moving into an old people’s home today. After waiting several hours in the retirement home lobby, he gently smiles as he is told that his room is ready. </em></p>
		<p><em>His wife of 80 has recently died and he is obliged to leave his home.</em></p>
		<p><em>As he slowly walks to the elevator, using his cane, I describe his small room to him, including the sheet hung at the window which serves as a curtain.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I like it very much’, he says, with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old boy who has just been given a new puppy.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘You haven’t even seen the room yet, hang on a moment, we are almost there’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘That has nothing to do with it’, he replies.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘It is already decided in my mind that I like my room. It is a decision I take every morning when I wake up’. he says gently and continues.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Happiness is something I choose in advance. Whether or not I like the room does not depend on the furniture or the decor rather it depends on how I decide to see it’ he pauses and then adds, ‘I can choose. I can spend my day in bed enumerating all the difficulties that I have with the parts of my body that no longer work very well or I can get up and give thanks to heaven for those parts that are still in working order’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Every day is a gift, and as long as I can open my eyes, I will focus on the new day and all the happy memories that I have built up during my life’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Old age is like a bank account. You withdraw in later life what you have deposited along the way’.</em></p>
		<p>When Ashish concluded, Amina commented ‘So, his advice to us seems to be ‘deposit all the happiness you can in your bank account of memories’, what a beautiful idea<em>’</em>. </p>
		<p>‘Yes, we should start depositing when we are young, so that we can have a fat bank balance of happiness when we grow old’. Tejas commented with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
		<p>Then Amina read out her story.</p>
		<p><em>During a class at Fresno Pacific University, a speaker asked one of the spouses in the audience: ‘Does your husband make you happy?’</em></p>
		<p><em>At this moment, the husband stood up straighter, showing complete confidence. He knew his wife would say yes, because she had never complained about anything during their marriage. However, his wife answered the question with a resounding No. ‘No, my husband does not make me happy’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The husband was baffled, but his wife continued:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘My husband never made me unhappy and he does not make me happy. I am happy. My being happy or not is not dependent on him but on me. I am the only person on whom my happiness depends. I choose to be happy in every situation and every moment of my life, for if my happiness depended on another person, thing or circumstance, I would be in serious trouble. Everything that exists in this life constantly changes: the human being, the riches, my body, the climate, my boss, the pleasures, the friends and my physical and mental health. I could quote an endless list. I need to decide to be happy regardless of anything else that happens. Whether I own a lot or a little, I am happy! Whether I’m going out or staying home alone, I’m happy! Whether I am rich or poor, I am happy!’</em></p>
		<p><em>She continued:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I am married, but I was already happy when I was single. I’m happy for myself. I love my life not because my life is easier than anyone else’s, but because I have decided to be happy as an individual. I am responsible for my happiness. When I take this obligation from my husband and anyone else, I free them from the burden of carrying me on their shoulders. It makes everyone’s life much lighter. And that’s how I’ve had a successful marriage for so many years’.</em></p>
		<p>‘I think this story teaches that we and we alone are responsible for our attitude to life. We cannot give anyone else the responsibility to control our life. If we have positive attitude and take responsibility of our own lives, even if it’s hot, even if we’re sick, even if we do not have money, even if someone has hurt us, even if someone does not love us we should value ourselves’. Swapna commented.</p>
		<p>‘I wondered whether this story would fit in here at all. But now I think it will. Let’s listen to it and then you tell me what you think of it’. With that remark Anjali read out her story.</p>
		<p><em>This is a story of a mouse that lived in a small hole near a garbage dump in a big city. The mouse felt wretched as it lived in constant fear and anxiety. The reason for its anxiety was that it was terrified of the cat that lived near the same garbage dump. Once, when he was happily enjoying his meal of leftover cookies thrown in the garbage, the cat pounced on it. The mouse ran back towards the hole and had a narrow escape.</em></p>
		<p><em>One day a magician passed by the garbage dump. He could sense the anxiety of the mouse and asked it the reason for its distress. The mouse narrated its narrow escape from the cat. The magician pitied it and chanted a few magical words and turned the mouse into a cat. The mouse thanked the magician profusely. The magician walked away feeling happy for the mouse which is a cat now. But then the mouse became afraid of the dog. The next day when the magician was passing by he heard the plight of the cat and turned it into a dog. Then the dog began to fear the panther. So, the magician next changed it into a panther. So, the mouse which is a panther now started living in the jungle. However, it now started fearing the hunter. The magician was very puzzled. He reflected upon the entire series of episodes and understood he could not help it. He chanted a few magical words and turned the panther into a mouse again saying, ‘No matter what I do for you, I cannot save you because you have the heart of a mouse’.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali concluded the story and looked around for comments.</p>
		<p>Ashish was first to comment. ‘I think nobody can help us unless we want to be helped’.</p>
		<p>‘For that we need to mould our own thinking. We should be ready to receive suggestions for improvement and then try to implement them. Actually, we have to <strong>will</strong> it if we want a change’. Tejas commented.</p>
		<p>Hemant took out a small newspaper clipping from his pocket. ‘This is a regular column that appears in The Hindu. It is called ‘Conversations with self’. I’ll read an excerpt’ Hemant read it out:</p>
		<p><em>Instead of focusing on what we have, we always divert our attention to what we do not have. In so doing, we put in all our energies, engaging our thoughts with what we do not have, spend all our energy in attempting to alleviate our poverty and thus lose sight of the abundance we otherwise command.</em></p>
		<p><em>A teacher of mine, several years ago, admonished me for grovelling in my lack of success. He suggested I direct my efforts to building on what I have achieved rather than what I have lost. He said words that ring true for me even today: ‘What you focus on grows and what you ignore disappears. Focus on the ‘good’ you have and what is not good will diminish’. ‘Celebrate what you have,’ he said ‘harness your positivity and surely that which deplete you will vanish’. </em></p>
		<p>‘Wow, what a wonderful lesson in cultivating positive attitude!’ Tejas remarked.</p>
		<p>‘I think we should just be ourselves rather than trying to be someone else. There’s a difference between emulating and imitating, I think’. Ashish commented. ‘Most of us feel unhappy with ourselves looking at others and their abilities’.</p>
		<p>‘We should learn to build on our strengths and not feel low about weaknesses, right?’ Amina said. ‘This reminds me of the short lesson Azim Premji gave in the ‘Shaping Young Minds Programme’. Let me recall what he said,’ Amina continued with her brief narration of Azim Premji’s story.</p>
		<p><em>There is an imaginary story of a rabbit. The rabbit was enrolled in a rabbit school. Like all rabbits, it could hop very well but could not swim. At the end of the year, the rabbit got high marks in hopping but failed in swimming. The parents were concerned. They said, ‘Forget about hopping. You are anyway good at it. Concentrate on swimming’. They sent the rabbit for tuitions in swimming. And guess what happened? The rabbit forgot how to hop! As for swimming, have you ever seen a rabbit swim? While it is important for us to know what we are not good at, we must also cherish what is good in us. That is because it is only our strengths that can give us the energy to correct our weaknesses. </em></p>
		<p>‘Don’t we see a warning to parents who push their children to achieve beyond their capacity?’ Tejas grinned.</p>
		<p>‘Hey that reminds me of something I read recently. Here it is’ Raju started narrating. </p>
		<p><em>One day a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test. They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin. The professor handed out the question paper, with the text facing down as usual. Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone’s surprise, there were no questions.... just a black dot in the centre of the page. The professor seeing the expression on everyone’s face said: ‘I want you to write what you see there’. The students were confused but started writing.</em></p>
		<p><em> At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud. All of them described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. etc. etc. </em></p>
		<p><em>After he read them all, the professor began: ‘I am not going to grade you on this; I just wanted to give you something to think about. No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focussed on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy but we always focus on the dark spots. Our life is a gift given to us with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature is renewing itself every day, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see every day. However, we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on. The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life. Enjoy each one of your blessings, each moment that life gives you. Be happy and live a life filled with LOVE’.</em></p>
		<p>‘This supports the story Ashish read out’ everyone agreed.</p>
		<p>Swapna was next to read.‘I can give you a story which shows how to deal with adverse circumstances and come out of it’.</p>
		<p><em>One day a farmer’s donkey fell down into a well...</em></p>
		<p>‘Oh! donkey story’. Hemant laughed.</p>
		<p>‘Well, don’t underestimate a donkey’. Swapna retorted and continued.</p>
		<p><em>One day a farmer’s donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn’t worth it to retrieve the donkey.</em></p>
		<p><em>He invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone’s amazement he became quiet. </em></p>
		<p><em>A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. </em></p>
		<p><em>As the farmer’s neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off! </em></p>
		<p>Swapna looked around and looked at Hemant meaningfully.</p>
		<p>Everyone said Hemant should apologise to the donkey for underestimating its intelligence and attitude!</p>
		<p>‘It is my turn to read the story’ Amina said and began her story.</p>
		<p><em>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.</em></p>
		<p><em>Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse on the road where the boulder was. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand!</em></p>
		<p>At the end of the story Amina asked, ‘Well, what have we learnt now?’</p>
		<p>‘Don’t expect others to work for you. Do it yourself and get the reward’. Tejas grinned mischievously.</p>
		<p>‘There may be many obstacles in our path. If we can deal with them, every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition. Am I right?’ Ashish quipped.</p>
		<p>‘I think you are right. What matters is how we look at the obstacles and how we deal with them’. Swapna supported Ashish.</p>
		<p>‘I have a story which tells us about attitude to others’ Hemant said eagerly. He then read it out.</p>
		<p><em>There once was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon.</em></p>
		<p><em>One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbours.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbours when they are also entering corn in competition with yours each year?’ the reporter asked. ‘Why sir,’ said the farmer, ‘didn’t you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbours grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbours grow good corn’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Can we call this positive attitude to self in relation to others?’ Ashish asked.</p>
		<p>‘I think yes. He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbour’s corn also improves. We live in a society. Our well-being is very much related to others’ well-being’ explained Nandita, who had just walked in to listen to the story. Look at this picture and you will understand what I mean. She handed over a small piece of paper that made the entire group nod in agreement.</p>
		<img src="images/MetoWe_fmt.jpg" alt="images" />
		<p>‘Oh, that’s why in our culture we always pray <em>Sarvejana Sukhinobhavantu</em>, let everyone be happy’. Anjali remarked.</p>
		<p>‘Hey! ‘Let’s all be happy’ reminds me of Ubuntu’. Swapna said.</p>
		<p>‘What’s Ubuntu?’ all said in chorus.</p>
		<p>‘Listen to this then’. Swapna gave a very brief narration.</p>
		<p><em>UBUNTU - A very nice story from Africa ...</em></p>
		<p><em>The motivation behind the Ubuntu culture in Africa ...</em></p>
		<p><em>An Anthropologist proposed a game to the African tribal children. He placed a basket of sweets near a tree and made the children stand 100 metres away. Then he announced that whoever reaches first would get all the sweets in the basket. When he said ‘ready steady go!’ </em></p>
		<p><em>Do you know what these children did?</em></p>
		<p><em>They all held each other’s hands, ran together towards the tree, divided the sweets equally among themselves, ate the sweets and enjoyed it.</em></p>
		<p><em>When the Anthropologist asked them why they did so, they answered ‘Ubuntu’.</em></p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>Which meant -</em><br />
			<em>‘How can one be happy when the others are sad?’</em><br />
			<em>Ubuntu in their language means -</em><br />
			<em>‘I am because we are!’</em>
		</p>
		<p>‘This is an excellent message of achieving collective success. This message is given in one of the corporate games played to build attitude to success. The game goes like this – <em>a group is given a balloon each to blow and secure. Each one is given a toothpick. A time frame is given and the group is told that those who have the balloon in hand at the end of the set time are the winners. Surprisingly each one in the group tries to save his/her balloon and deflate the others’. This is the human mentality in general. In the end, none is left with a balloon. The tutor then explains that success does not mean others’ defeat. The actual instruction was only to keep the balloon intact and not to deflate that of a colleague</em>’. Raju informed the group.</p>
		<p>‘The group should learn a lot from the Ubuntu philosophy’. Amina commented. </p>
		<p>‘Can I present a story that depicts what <em>our attitude to others should not be like?’</em> Anjali said hesitatingly.</p>
		<p>‘Of course. We should know, so that we can be on guard against such an attitude and also correct ourselves’. Raju was emphatic in his view.</p>
		<p>Anjali said, ‘This is a story narrated by one of the characters in Dostoyevsky’s novel <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>’. </p>
		<p><em>Once upon a time there was a peasant woman who was very wicked. And she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So, her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember to tell God. ‘She once pulled up an onion in her garden,’ said he, ‘and gave it to a beggar woman’. And God answered: ‘You take that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake and let her take hold and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to Paradise but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is’. The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. ‘Come’, said he, ‘catch hold and I’ll pull you out’. And he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her right out when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her. ‘I’m to be pulled out, not you,’ she said. ‘It’s my onion, not yours’. As soon as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So, the angel wept and wept and went away.</em></p>
		<p>‘Whew! What a contrast to the farmer in the other story!’ Ashish said spontaneously.</p>
		<p>‘And also, Ubuntu!’ added Amina.</p>
		<p>‘Don’t you think our attitude may change once we look at the same thing from a different angle?’ Anjali asked.</p>
		<p> ‘I think so. I have a beautiful story telling us how we can change our <em>perspective</em> for the better’. Swapna didn’t wait before she started reading out the story. </p>
		<p><em>There was a family of pigeons which had made the top of a mosque as their abode. </em></p>
		<p><em>They were living happily for a while and when one day the mosque was being decorated for a festival and the pigeons had to think of relocating themselves. </em></p>
		<p><em>The head of the family discussed the migration with the others and they moved to a church. They settled down in their new abode and life was going on smoothly till the church was being decorated for a festival. The family got together and so they discussed this issue and planned another migration. This time around they migrated and made their new abode atop a temple. </em></p>
		<p><em>One baby pigeon had a doubt and asked its mother, ‘Please don’t mind if I ask you a question’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The mother pigeon said, ‘Go ahead’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The baby asked, ‘When we were in the mosque people who came to worship were all known as Muslims and they followed Islam. When we moved to the church, people who came to worship were all known as Christians and they followed Christianity. Now here, people who come are called Hindus and they follow Hinduism. How come the same people just because they go to different places of worship get called by different names, where as we are called pigeons everywhere we go’.</em></p>
		<p><em>To this the mother replied, ‘We are way ahead of them. Good doubt indeed, we stay at a height and we also fly, where as human beings are on the ground and they do not ever rise, it is just for that reason we are so elevated in our thinking and they are still on the ground. When perhaps a man rises to this level he will be able to see himself above all these minor divides’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Ah, a beautiful story indeed. It tells us that when we are on the same level, we can’t see very far, but when we raise our levels we see from the top and enjoy a broader vision’. Raju said with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘I wish those who act as a divisive force in our society get this view of the pigeons. It might solve so many problems’. Ashish was quick to add.</p>
		<p>‘Change of perspective changes perception’ commented Tejas.</p>
		<p>‘Hey, I have a story which illustrates what Amina said’ Anjali quickly pulled out a sheet of paper from her folder and started reading out. </p>
		<p><em>There was an old woman who was always in tears. One day a monk asked her why she was always sad. ‘It’s like this,’ said the woman. ‘I have two daughters. One is married to an umbrella seller and the other is married to a noodle maker. If it’s sunny I feel sorry for the daughter married to the umbrella seller as her husband won’t be able to sell any umbrellas that day and if it’s cloudy I feel sorry for my second daughter as noodles need to be dried in the sun and that day her husband won’t have any noodles to sell the next day. It is not possible for me to be happy as it is always either sunny or cloudy in these parts. That’s why I feel sad always’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The monk smiled. ‘In fact, you are one of the most fortunate people who can always be happy. The next time when it is sunny think of your second daughter whose husband is a noodles maker. When it is cloudy think of the daughter whose husband sells umbrellas. Imagine the joy she would feel that day. Take delight in their happiness in turns’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The old woman did as the monk advised. From that day nobody saw her sad.</em></p>
		<p>There was a smile on everyone’s face as Anjali concluded her story.</p>
		<p>When Raju showed the stories to Nandita in the evening she asked, ‘Hasn’t anyone got anything about attitude to work and responsibility?’</p>
		<p>‘Well, not yet’. Raju said.</p>
		<p>‘Share this with your friends’ she gave him a sheet of paper. Raju read it and smiled. ‘This is great to get us started on the topic’. Nandita had some engagement that Sunday. So, the brief story acted as food for thought for the group.</p>
		<p>This is what Nandita gave Raju. </p>
		<p><em>This is the story of four friends called Everybody, Somebody, Nobody and Anybody.</em></p>
		<p><em>An important work was assigned to them. Everybody thought Somebody would do it because it is a work Anybody could do. But in the bargain, Nobody did it. Since Nobody did it the work was not done. So, Everybody became angry and thought that Somebody had to be blamed and pointed to Anybody who came in the vicinity. Ultimately Nobody owned up the responsibility for the work not being carried out.</em></p>
		<p>The group could collect a few stories for the Saturday reading.</p>
		<p>‘The story of the four friends is an important message on the attitude of ‘passing the buck’. Tejas remarked.</p>
		<p>‘A sad state of affairs we see in many places of work where people shirk work’. Raju said.</p>
		<p>‘But work shirkers are always looked down upon, are they not? They are not performers’. Swapna said looking indignant.</p>
		<p>‘That is true. Let us have another story, which is a contrast’. Anjali said and took out her story.</p>
		<p><em>A traveller came upon three individuals working with stone. Curious as to what these workers were doing, the traveller approached the first worker and asked, ‘What are you doing?’ Without the slightest hesitation, the worker replied, ‘I am a stone cutter and I am cutting stones’. Still unclear of the workers’ task, the traveller approached the second worker and asked the same question. To this the second worker thought for a moment, gazed briefly at the traveller and said that he was cutting stones to make pillars. Perplexed by the two different responses, the sojourner approached the third worker and asked, ‘What are you doing?’Stopping for a moment, the worker stared at the stone in his hand, slowly turned to the traveller, and said, ‘I am a stone cutter and I AM BUILDING A CATHEDRAL!’</em></p>
		<p>‘Three men - all working at the same site, performing the same task - each had three very different perspectives of what they were working toward’. Raju wondered.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, look at their attitude to their work. While the first stone cutter had a very narrow view, the second one’s goal seems to be limited. The third stone cutter seems to have the right perspective of his work. I am sure he had a very positive attitude towards his job and will go a long way in his career’. Anjali said looking satisfied with her story.</p>
		<p>Ashish took out the story he brought and said ‘Let’s discuss the story after I read it’.</p>
		<p><em>An old farmer lived with his grandson. He read the Bhagavad Gita every morning and encouraged the boy to read the religious scripture. One day the grandson went to the farmer and said, ‘I read the Bhagavad Gita every morning just like you do, but I don’t understand it and whatever I understand I forget soon. What is the use of reading the book?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The old man quietly turned from putting the coal in the stove and said, ‘take this coal basket and fetch some water in it from the river’. The boy went to the river with the basket. But the all the water gathered in the basket leaked before he got back home. The farmer asked him to try again. This happened several times. Every time he filled the basket with the river water, it leaked out completely by the time he reached home. Finally, the frustrated boy cried out, ‘See grandpa, it is useless’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Do you really think it is useless?’ the old man smiled, ‘look at the basket’. The boy noticed that the dirty black coal basket now looked squeaky clean. ‘Son, that is what happens when you read the Bhagavad Gita. You may not understand it in the beginning or even remember details. But if you sincerely keep reading it, you will realise its benefit someday’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Ah! This story tells us about the sincerity with which we do whatever we do. Sincerity pays in the end’. Anjali commented.</p>
		<p>‘I think besides sincere effort it also tells us that perseverance pays. Is it not true in the case of our studies too?’ Amina added.</p>
		<p>‘True. Sincerity certainly pays off in both personal as well as professional life’. Swapna said. </p>
		<p>‘I have a story which I think will surely give us a message about our attitude to our work and profession’. Tejas started reading the story he had brought.</p>
		<p><em>A man once visited a temple under construction where he saw a sculptor making an Idol of GOD... Suddenly he noticed a similar idol lying nearby...</em></p>
		<p><em>Surprised, he asked the sculptor ‘Do you need two statues of the same idol?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No,’ said the Sculptor without looking up,</em> <em>‘We need only one, but the first one got damaged at the last stage..’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The gentleman examined the idol and found no apparent damage.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Where is the damage?’ he asked.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘There is a scratch on the nose of the idol’ said the sculptor, still busy with his work.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Where are you going to install the idol?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The sculptor replied that it would be installed on a pillar twenty feet high.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘If the idol is that far who is going to know that there is a scratch on the nose?’ the gentleman asked.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sculptor stopped work, looked up at the gentleman, smiled and said, ‘I will know it..’. </em></p>
		<p>‘Wow! This story for sure stands as an example of what a true professional is; who believes that excellence is a drive from inside, not outside’. Raju said and all of them agreed with him.</p>
		<p>‘I think we can call this ‘accountability’ I learnt this word recently’. Tejas added with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘No work is inferior. Whatever we do we must excel in it. This episode from Abraham Lincoln’s life tells us this’. Amina read out what she brought.</p>
		<p><em>On the first day, as President, Abraham Lincoln entered to give his inaugural address, just in the middle, one man stood up. He was a rich aristocrat. He said, ‘Mr. Lincoln, you should not forget that your father used to make shoes for my family’. And the whole Senate laughed; they thought they had made fun of Abraham Lincoln.</em></p>
		<p><em>Lincoln looked at the man and said, ‘Sir I know that my father used to make shoes in your house for your family and many others here…. Because the way he made shoes; nobody else could. He was a creator. His shoes were not just shoes; he poured his whole soul in it. I want to ask you, have you any complaint? Because I know how to make shoes myself. If you have any complaint I can make another pair of shoes. But as far as I know, nobody has ever complained about my father’s shoes. He was a genius, a great creator and I am proud of my father’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The whole Senate was struck dumb. They could not understand what kind of man Abraham Lincoln was. He was proud because his father did the job so well that not even a single complaint had ever been heard.</em></p>
		<p>‘This also speaks for the self-esteem of Lincoln’. Amina commented.</p>
		<p>All these stories were placed on the college notice board. This time the group found that the students were discussing the stories in the canteen over a cup of tea!</p>
