		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose and in the right way - that is not within everybody’s power and is not easy.</em></strong></p>

		<p>When she entered her study Nandita noticed that Swapna and Anjali were sitting next to each other as usual but were not really together. She also noticed that Anjali’s eyes were red. It was obvious that she was crying. Swapna looked upset too. Nandita sensed the tension in the air. But none in the group told her anything about it. May be there was some misunderstanding and they would clear it up soon, she thought. </p>
		<p>‘Today we are going to talk about emotions’ Nandita announced. ‘What do we understand by ‘emotions’? I am sure all of us know the word ‘<em>emoticons</em>’’ Nandita smiled.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, of course, the smiley that we send to express our happiness, and also those funny faces depicting anger, amusement, sadness and so on..’. Ashish was quick to answer.</p>
		<p>‘Correct. It’s a portmanteau word. The word is a blend of ‘emotion’ and ‘icon’’. Nandita explained and continued. ‘Anger, fear, sadness, happiness and so on, are emotions or feelings. Controlling feelings in ourselves and sometimes in others in our daily life as well as workplace is called <strong>emotion management skill</strong>’. Nandita paused.</p>
		<p>Everyone looked thoughtful. Raju said, ‘But at times it is so difficult a task to do so. Much depends on how others talk, behave and relate with you. If we have no emotions and reactions we will be like dead wood’.</p>
		<p>‘Quite right. That’s why this skill assumes so much importance. We live in a society and interact with people around us almost all our waking hours. We are subject to so many emotions. Controlling emotions does not mean to become ‘emotionless’ but to have balance in expressing emotions’. Nandita explained.</p>
		<p>‘It is so difficult at times’ said Hemant.</p>
		<p>‘I agree. The first thing we need to remember in interpersonal relations is ‘don’t <strong>react</strong> but <strong>respond</strong>’’.</p>
		<p>Anjali and Swapna were silent all along the conversation. But in the end, with the words that came from Nandita they looked up as if startled.</p>
		<p>‘Anger is one emotion that can create a lot of damage. I will give you a small story as an example’. Nandita narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>A man was polishing his new, expensive car. His four-year-old son was playing around and picked up a stone and scratched on the side of the car. In anger, the furious man took his child’s hand and hit it many times, not realizing he was using a wrench. </em></p>
		<p><em>At the hospital, although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers. The child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures. When the child saw his father, he asked ‘Daddy, I’m sorry about your car, but when will my fingers grow back?’ The man was speechless. He went back to the car and kicked it many times. Devastated by his own actions, sitting in front of the car he looked at the scratches. His son had written ‘LOVE YOU DAD’.</em></p>
		<p>At the end of the story there was a stunning silence in the room. Nandita saw Anjali quietly reaching out and pressing Swapna’s hand.</p>
		<p>Raju was thinking about the news that appeared from time to time about the angry teacher’s cane blinding a child or fracturing the skull.</p>
		<p>After a few seconds, Nandita said, ‘I know that this little story which was based on a real-life incident has touched your heart. You must now be wondering how to control anger. This story, though a little philosophical, will give you a sound message. Now she took out her notebook and started reading the story.</p>
		<p><em>A sage was walking along the path. Some youngsters of the village followed making fun of him. They stood in his way and tried to provoke his anger. The holy man didn’t react to their actions and took the sidewalk. Again, the young men stood in his way and he silently walked along the narrow space left. This continued till he reached the outskirts of the village. There was no change in the demeanour of the sage. His bright face didn’t show any signs of anger. He looked like a mother amused by her naughty kids.</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth felt hurt and angry as they couldn’t achieve what they wanted. Then they asked him, ‘We troubled you so much but you didn’t lose your temper. How could you retain the smile on your face?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The sage told them, ‘To get provoked and to strike back does not happen where there is love. I am like a river. Can anyone stop the river from flowing? You may build a barrage and divert its flow or stop it for a while and feel triumphant. However, the river takes a pause and rests. Again, it flows with fresh force. It flows changing its course. It understands the truth that there are several paths for onward journey in this vast world. Look at the sapling that emerges out of the earth. Keep a small boulder and watch. The sapling seeks the small space under the boulder and slowly emerges next to the boulder. It is aware of its existence. Only when you are completely aware of your existence are you filled with love for yourself and everything around you. Then you will not reject, resist or rebel. There will be no violence’. So, saying, the sage walked away. </em></p>
		<p>‘I get two powerful messages from this story’. Raju remarked. ‘Many a time we get teased by others. Sometimes the teasing becomes painful. We should not become depressed by it. If we don’t resist or retort it is not cowardice. Secondly, if we have self-esteem and love for ourselves, we can face the troublemakers’.</p>
		<p>‘I see another point there. If a door is closed, we need to seek some other. There are always alternative ways’. Ashish observed.</p>
		<p>Nandita appreciated both the observations and said, ‘Anger is a perfectly normal human emotion. We have to learn to deal with it appropriately. We feel angry from time to time, yet this feeling can lead us to say or do things that we later regret. Anger can reduce our ability to think and make us act inappropriately. Anger is not something you cannot control. Getting angry is not like getting thirsty or hungry over which you have little control. It is not a phenomenon which is involuntary. You can <strong>will</strong> to control it’.</p>
		<p>She continued after a pause, ‘There are many anger management techniques that you can learn and practise or teach others. However, you should seek professional help if anger is resulting in a long-term negative impact on your relationships, is making you unhappy, or is resulting in any dangerous or violent behaviour’.</p>
		<p>She then left the room saying they should look for more stories with evidence of emotion management.</p>
		<p>On that Saturday when they pooled the stories they found each one with a strong message as to how damaging anger could be and offered various strategies to control it.</p>
		<p>This was the story Anjali read out:</p>
		<p><em>There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy drove 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence.</em></p>
		<p><em>Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and his father suggested that the boy should pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper.</em></p>
		<p><em>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.</em></p>
		<p><em>The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, ‘You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say sorry, the wound is still there’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The little boy then understood how powerful his words were. He looked up at his father and said ‘I hope you can forgive me father for the holes I put in you’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Of course, I can’ said the father. Forgiveness comes easy for many people but the scars of the past, they never go away.</em></p>
		<p>‘Whenever we talk about forgiveness I remember this story of the Buddha’. Tejas said. Everyone wanted to listen to it as the entire group liked the Buddha stories as each story had a very good message. Tejas then gave the story from his memory.</p>
		<p><em>Once, the Buddha was in an assembly when a man walked in, looking furious. He was a restless businessman. He thought that his children were spending hours with the Buddha when they could have engaged themselves in business, making more and more money. This was what had upset the businessman.</em></p>
		<p><em>So, he walked straight up to the Buddha and spat on his face. The Buddha showed no anger, though the disciples around him were angry. They would have liked to react but could not because the Buddha was there. The Buddha simply smiled. The businessman saw that his action was not drawing a reaction, so he walked away in a huff.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Buddha did not react or say anything. He just smiled. And that was enough to shock the angry man. For the first time in his life, the man had met someone who would just smile when he spat on his face. That man could not sleep all night. The next day he went and fell at the Buddha’s feet and said, ‘Please forgive me. I did not know what I did’. To which the Buddha replied, ‘I cannot excuse you!’</em></p>
		<p><em>Everyone including the man was surprised. The Buddha then explained the reason for his statement. He said, ‘Why should I forgive you when you have done nothing wrong?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The businessman looked more surprised and told the Buddha that it was he who had wronged him by spitting on him. The Buddha simply said, ‘Oh! That person is not here now. If I ever meet that person whom you spat on, I will tell him to excuse you. To this person who is here, you have done no wrong. Nor are you the same angry man who spat yesterday’.</em></p>
		<p>When the story was concluded Anjali looked at Swapna who reached out to her with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes we mix up people with their actions and develop an opinion or attitude towards them. This small piece tells us it may not always be correct’. Ashish read out from the clipping he brought. </p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>I have an aunt, </em><br />
			<em>My aunt loves eating brinjal,</em><br />
			<em>I hate eating brinjal,</em><br />
			<em>So, I hate my aunt.</em>
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>What I did is I mixed my aunt with brinjal. </em><br />
			<em>I must understand that my aunt is not brinjal. </em><br />
			<em>Similarly,</em>
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>Ganpat is my peon,</em><br />
			<em>Ganpat comes late to office,</em><br />
			<em>I do not like people coming late,</em><br />
			<em>I do not like Ganpat.</em><br />
			<em>I have mixed Ganpat as a person with his negative quality.</em>
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>My boss is nagging,</em><br />
			<em>I do not like nagging,</em><br />
			<em>I hate my boss.</em>
		</p>
		<p>None of them noticed when Nandita came in until she spoke. ‘I think this is very important in our work front. One quality of professionalism is ‘objectivity’. Whatever be our personal differences it should not come in the way of our work when we are a team’.</p>
		<p>‘But it is so difficult to separate people and their behaviour’. Hemant said.</p>
		<p>‘I know, but we can at least tone down our attitude towards such people’. Amina said. ‘So, can we call it ‘hatred management?’ Tejas said with a twinkle in his eyes. Everyone laughed at the new expression.</p>
		<p>Raju said, ‘I think for developing emotion management skills, we need to work on changing our thoughts and feelings that are generated whenever our values are touched by the actions of a person or an event. We need to separate people from their qualities and should work on the positive qualities. This is important because the change in our thoughts and feelings is what helps change our emotions, preventing from reactive outbursts’.</p>
		<p>‘I have with me a beautiful analogy given by His Highness Bhakti Tirth Swami which may help us understand managing emotions’. Ashish said and started reading. </p>
		<p><em>What’s inside us and the deep-rooted senses?</em></p>
		<p><em>‘If I were to squeeze this orange as hard as I could, what, do you think would come out of it?’ I asked him.</em></p>
		<p><em>He looked at me like I was a little crazy and said, ‘Juice, of course’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Do you think apple juice could come out of it?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No!’ he laughed.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘What about grapefruit juice?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No!’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘What would come out of it?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Orange juice, of course’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Why? Why when you squeeze an orange does orange juice come out?’</em></p>
		<p><em>He may have been getting a little exasperated with me at this point.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Well, it’s an orange and that’s what’s inside’.</em></p>
		<p><em>I nodded.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Let’s assume that this orange isn’t an orange, but it’s you. And someone squeezes you, puts pressure on you, says something you don’t like and offends you. And out of you comes anger, hatred, bitterness, fear, why?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The answer, as our young friend has told us, is because that’s what’s inside’.</em></p>
		<p><em>It’s one of the greatest lessons of life. What comes out when life squeezes you? When someone hurts or offends you? If anger, pain and fear come out of you, it’s because that’s what’s inside you. It doesn’t matter who does the squeezing, your mother, your brother, your children, your boss, the government. If someone says something about you that you don’t like, what comes out of you is what’s inside. </em></p>
		<p><em>And what’s inside is up to you, it’s your choice.</em></p>
		<p><em>When someone puts pressure on you and out of you comes anything other than love, it’s because that’s what you’ve allowed to be inside. </em></p>
		<p><em>Once you take away all those negative things you don’t want in your life and replace them with love, you’ll find yourself living a highly functioning and fruitful life’.</em></p>
		<p>‘It is not that easy to fill ourselves with only love. We are humans. However, there must be some strategies to control one’s anger so that the damage it does can be contained’. Anjali said.</p>
		<p>‘I agree. It is natural but to get angry sometimes. But what is appreciable is the change in our perspective to better ourselves’. Amina said, ‘Well. I have read a story recently to illustrate this’. Amina narrated the story. </p>
		<p><em>A young and successful executive was travelling down a neighbourhood street, going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar. He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something.</em></p>
		<p><em>As his car passed, no children appeared. Instead, a big stone smashed into the Jag’s side door! He slammed on the brakes and backed the Jag back to the spot where the brick was thrown.</em> <em>The young man became furious</em>.</p>
		<p><em>He then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car shouting,</em> <em>‘What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing? That’s a new car and that stone you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?’ The young boy was apologetic. ‘Please, mister... please, I’m sorry but I didn’t know what else to do,’ He pleaded. ‘I threw the stone because no one else would stop...’. With tears rolling down his face and off his chin, the boy pointed to a spot just around a parked car. ‘It’s my brother,’ he said, ‘He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can’t lift him up’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Now sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, ‘Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He’s hurt and he’s too heavy for me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat... He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out a linen handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay. ‘Thank you and may God bless you,’ the grateful child told the stranger. </em></p>
		<p><em>Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.</em> <em>It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was very noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door.</em></p>
		<p>‘The dent, like the holes in the fence, would be a constant reminder to control one’s anger’. commented Swapna thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>‘If only the father in the first story listened to his son before punishing him..’. Anjali said regretfully thinking of Nandita’s story. </p>
		<p>‘It might have helped him change his attitude to others as well as made him control his anger’. Hemant added.</p>
