		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>I will come again </em></strong>and conquer you  Because as a mountain you cannot grow, But as a human I can !!</p>
		<p class="quote-author"><strong><em>[After failing to climb Everest, the reply of a great man...Sir Edmund Hillary]</em></strong></p>
		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake. What’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right..... Don’t look into the past and regret anything that you did. Because, at that point in your life that’s what you wanted...Your struggles develop your strengths.</em></strong></p>

		<p>‘Do you know the story of Arjuna?’ Nandita asked as she settled down in her seat, when they met the following Sunday.</p>
		<p>‘There are so many stories about Arjuna in Mahabharata...He passed a very difficult test in archery to win the hand of Draupadi’. Raju wanted to know which one she meant.</p>
		<p>‘Well, this episode happened in his childhood. In fact, he could pass the test later because of his attitude right from his childhood. Listen to this episode’. Nandita began the story.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>Once, Dronacharya wished to test his disciples’ skill in archery. He hung a wooden bird from the branch of a tree and then summoned his disciples. He called each of them one by one and asked to aim for the eye of the wooden bird and be ready to shoot. But, when he was ready, he would ask the disciple to describe all that he was able to see. All of them, including Yudhishtra described the garden, the tree, flowers, the branch from which the bird was suspended and the bird itself. Guru Dronacharya then asked them to step aside. He called upon Arjuna and asked what he could see. Arjuna aimed his arrow carefully and told his Guru that he could see only the eye of the bird.</em></p>
		<p>Nandita concluded her story and looked around with a smile. ‘Can you guess what this week’s topic is?’</p>
		<p>‘Concentration?’ Hemant ventured a guess.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, but not quite right. It is <strong><em>goal setting and meeting the challenges</em></strong>’. Nandita answered and continued.</p>
		<p>‘Everything we do in life should have a purpose. At every stage in life, in every field we set some goal to achieve; whether we are sportspersons, students or employees in a firm. Goal setting is very important for achieving success’.</p>
		<p>‘Isn’t it rather boring to set goals for everything you do?’ Anjali asked.</p>
		<p>‘Well, as I told you earlier, we do everything with a reason. For example, if you are in a new place and if you have to reach a particular place, you ask for directions…’ </p>
		<p>‘I will use a Google map or GPS’ blurted out Tejas.</p>
		<p>Nandita smiled ‘Oh, I forgot that I’m speaking to techno-savvy youngsters. Well, you do use a GPS with a purpose to reach a particular place easily, don’t you?’</p>
		<p>‘Sure, we do’ </p>
		<p>‘So, that’s the goal and you are working towards a goal. Similarly, you study to do well in the exam, so that you get a good job’</p>
		<p>‘I see the whole point now’. Tejas said.</p>
		<p>‘Hmm, there are a few simple principles in setting goals- like clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback and complexity of task.<strong> First</strong>, you need to ask yourself ‘why am I doing this? What it will look like once the goal is completed?’ </p>
		<p><strong>Second</strong>, the goal must be challenging, achievable and realistic. It should be attainable, but at the same time challenging enough. I say this so that you do not underestimate yourself and put easily reachable goals before you. Nor should you set a very difficult, unrealistic task for yourself. What is needed here is a proper assessment of yourself. </p>
		<p><strong>The third</strong> principle to follow is to work towards the goal with commitment and dedication.<strong> Fourth</strong>, is a periodical review and feedback. Again, this need not come from others but you can go back to your plan and see for yourself whether you are going in the right direction.</p>
		<p><strong>Fifth</strong> and a very important principle is the task complexity. This can be met by chunking or setting milestones’.</p>
		<p>‘What is chunking?’ Hemant looked puzzled.</p>
		<p>‘That means breaking the big task into smaller parts or sub-goals like you break a big essay into sections. You work out the sections and then concentrate on each one till you complete the entire essay. Once when I had a number of targets to cover and poured out my worry to a friend. He said, ‘Simple. Prioritize your tasks, complete them one by one’. I follow this useful advice’. Nandita looked around for comments. The entire group looked very thoughtful.</p>
		<p>Raju quickly summarized the principles and said, ‘So these are the five principles:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Purpose</li>
			<li>Adequate challenge</li>
			<li>Commitment or dedication</li>
			<li>Review or feedback </li>
			<li>Task complexity</li>
		</ol>
		<p>‘Wow, how quick you are!’ all of them said almost as a chorus. At that Raju looked a bit shy but happy.</p>
		<p>‘Well, listen to this story Azim Premji gave us and let’s discuss if the five basic principles are followed or not’. Nandita gave the story.</p>
		<p><em>A friend of mine shared this incident with me. His eight-year old daughter was struggling away at a jigsaw puzzle. She kept at it for hours but could not succeed. Finally, it went beyond her bedtime. My friend told her, ‘Look, why don’t you just give up? I don’t think you will complete it tonight. Look at it another day’. The daughter looked with a strange look in her eyes, ‘But, dad, why should I give up? All the pieces are there! I have just got to put them together!’ </em></p>
		<p>‘I can see the challenge and the girl is clear about her goal. She also has commitment to complete the task...’. Raju offered his comment.</p>
		<p>Ashish was quick to add, ‘But when it comes to feedback from the father it was negative. He thought the task complexity was too challenging for the girl, but the girl had a positive attitude and also her own view of the puzzle was that she could do it as she had all the required resources with her’. </p>
		<p>‘Yes. If we persevere long enough, we can put any problem into its perspective. We know that Thomas Alva Edison did not stop with just developing an effective filament light bulb. His goal was to light the planet at night. In his lifetime he registered a record breaking 1093 patents achieving his big goal’. Nandita added.</p>
		<p>‘So, we are adding one more quality required for achieving the goal successfully, <em>perseverance</em>’. Tejas remarked.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, the big difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is, successful people have their goals in mind. They know where they want to go and finally they get there. So, you need to start with a target, a destination, a goal’. Nandita explained.</p>
		<p>‘Our teachers talk about the importance of goals in our career and life’. Raju added.</p>
		<p>‘That reminds me of a beautiful story in the school context. I will give you one more story of a student and then leave you to yourselves. Here it is’. Nandita narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>A boy went to the Principal and said ‘Madam, I won’t be coming to school anymore’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Principal asked ‘But why?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The boy said ‘Ah! I saw a teacher speaking bad of another teacher; You have another teacher who can’t read well; the staff is not good; students look down upon their fellow students and there are so many other wrong things happening in the school’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Principal replied ‘OK. But before you go, do me a favour: Take a glass full of water and walk three times around the School without spilling a drop on the floor. Afterwards, leave the school if you desire’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The boy thought: Now that’s quite easy!</em></p>
		<p><em>And he walked three times around the school as the Principal had asked. When he finished, he told her he was ready.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Principal asked ‘When you were walking around the school, did you see a teacher speaking bad about another teacher?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth replied ‘no’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Did you see any student looking at other students in a wrong way?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘You know why?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘You were focused on the glass to make sure you didn’t tilt it and spill any water. It’s the same with our life. When our focus is on our priorities, we don’t have time to see the mistakes of others’.</em></p>
		<p>‘I am sure now you understand the relevance of focussing our energies in achieving our goal and how Arjuna could do it with success’. Nandita left the room with these words.</p>
		<p>That day the entire group got motivated to look for as many good stories in goal setting as they could. When they met on Saturday, there were quite a few stories to listen to.</p>
		<p>This is Raju’s story:</p>
		<p><em>One man decided to reach for his dream. But he didn’t have enough strength to do it. So, he turned to his mother: ‘Mother, help me! Give me some strength’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Darling, I would be glad to help you, but I don’t have it. And everything I have, I have already given it to you…’</em></p>
		<p><em>He then asked a wise man:</em></p>
		<p><em>Master, tell me, where can I get strength?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘It is said that, it is on the Everest. But I couldn’t find anything there, except the snowy winds. And when I came back, the time was irretrievably lost…’.</em></p>
		<p><em>He asked the hermit:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Holy Father, where do I find the strength for realization of my dream?’ ‘In your prayers, my son. And if your dream is false, you will understand it and find peace in your prayers…’ The person asked everyone but the only result of his search was confusion.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Why are you so confused?’ asked an old man passing by. ‘I have a dream, good man. But I don’t know where to find strength for its realization. I asked everyone, but there was no one who could help me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No one?’ a light flashed in the old man’s eyes, ‘And did you ask yourself?’</em></p>
		<p>When Raju read it out Tejas said, ‘Well, I have one which almost takes off from where you have left and continues the point. Here it is’.</p>
		<p><em>A friend’s grandfather came to America from Eastern Europe. After being processed at Ellis Island, he went into a cafeteria in lower Manhattan to get something to eat. He sat down at an empty table and waited for someone to take his order. Of course, nobody did. Finally, a woman with a tray full of food sat down opposite him and informed him how the cafeteria worked.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Start out at that end,’ she said. ‘Just go along the line and pick out what you want. At the other end they’ll tell you how much you have to pay’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I soon learned that’s how everything works in America,’ the grandfather told a friend. ‘Life’s a cafeteria here. You can get anything you want as long as you are willing to pay the price. You can even get success but you’ll never get it if you wait for someone to bring it to you. You have to get up and get it yourself’.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, these stories very clearly tell us that we have to set our own goals and also find strength within us to achieve the goal’. Anjali commented. ‘Let me read out what I have brought’ </p>
		<p><em>Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks.</em></p>
		<p><em>They began with enthusiasm and no one said a word the whole day. By nightfall of the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went off.</em></p>
		<p><em>At that the first monk blurted out, ‘Oh, no! The candle is out’. The second monk said, ‘Hey! We are not supposed to speak!’ The third monk said in an irritated voice, ‘What is this? Why did you both break the silence?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The fourth monk smiled and said, ‘Wow! I’m the only one who hasn’t spoken’.</em></p>
		<p>Everyone had a smile on their lips as Anjali concluded the story.</p>
		<p>‘So, no one achieved his goal!’ commented Tejas.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, each monk broke the silence for a different reason. Each reason is a stumbling block in our journey towards the goal - distraction, hasty judgement, anger and pride’ commented Hemant.<em></em></p>
		<p>‘You are right. The first monk got distracted by one aspect of his experience (the candle) and forgot what was more important. The second monk was more worried about others following the rules than in actually practising it himself. He was hasty in his judgement. The third monk let his anger towards the first two monks. The singular burst of anger ruined the effort of the day. The fourth monk lost his way because of pride. He was convinced he was superior to the others, proving his ignorance’. Swapna analysed the behaviour of all the monks<em>.</em></p>
		<p>‘This means it is important to take control of your life. This parable will help us see the point. Some people keep complaining that life is not fair to them and so they are not successful. I have this beautiful conversation between Krishna and Karna which will reinforce the message of the parable’. Ashish read out from his notes.</p>
		<p><em>Karna asks Krishna –‘My mother left me the moment I was born. Is it my fault I was born an illegitimate child? I did not get education from Dronacharya because I was considered a non-Kshatriya. Parashuram taught me but then gave me the curse to forget everything since I was not a Kshatriya. A cow was accidentally hit by my arrow and its owner cursed me for no fault of mine. I was disgraced in Draupadi’s Swayamvar. Even Kunti finally told me the truth only to save her other sons. Whatever I received was through Duryodhana’s charity. </em></p>
		<p><em>So, how am I wrong in taking his side?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Krishna replies,</em></p>
		<p>‘<em>Karna, I was born in a jail. Death was waiting for me even before my birth. The night I was born, I was separated from my biological parents. From childhood you grew up hearing the noise of swords, chariots, horses, bow and arrows. I got only cow herd’s shed, dung and multiple attempts on my life even before I could walk! No army, no education. I could hear people saying I am the reason for all their problems. When all of you were being appreciated for your valour by your teachers, I had not even received any education. I joined gurukula of Rishi Sandipani only at the age of sixteen! You are married to a girl of your choice. I didn’t get the girl I loved and rather ended up marrying those who wanted me or the ones I rescued from demons. I had to move my whole community from the banks of Yamuna to the far-off Sea shore to save them from Jarasandha. I was called a coward for running away. If Duryodhana wins the war you will get a lot of credit. What do I get if Dharmaraja wins the war? Only the blame for the war and all related problems.</em></p>
		<p><em>Remember one thing Karna.... Everybody has challenges in life. Duryodhana also has a lot of unfairness in life and so has Yudhishtir. But what is right is known to your mind. No matter how much unfairness we got, how many times we were disgraced, how many times we were denied what was due to us, what is important is, ‘How’ you REACTED at that time...!</em></p>
		<p><em>Stop whining Karna. Talking about unfairness does not give you license to walk the wrong path’.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, it will not help just complaining and protesting. We should be able to take the initiative and mould our life as we want’. Hemant concluded with his remarks.</p>
		<p>‘I have a story of someone in more recent times to support what Hemant said,’ Anjali took out her story to read.</p>
		<p><em>A girl was born in Gloucestershire, England into a family with meagre income. Her mother suffered from multiple sclerosis and she had a strained relationship with her father. She grew up to be an unhappy teenager because of the family squabbles. </em></p>
		<p><em>She moved to London and took up various jobs. Soon after, her mother, who was battling for life for many years, died at the age of 45 leaving the grieving young girl. To escape her sadness, she took on the job of a teacher. She met a journalist and later got married to him. She gave birth to a beautiful daughter. But the marriage soon turned sour and ended in a divorce. She suffered from depression and was burdened by the responsibility of bringing up a child as a single parent. The young woman was almost penniless and survived on social welfare. However, she decided to take all problems in her stride and directed her energy in doing something she loved – writing. She wrote a children’s fantasy book. After several publishers rejected her book, Bloomsbury, a small publishing house agreed to publish her book. This book was </em><strong><em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em></strong><em>. Within four years she was awarded the ‘Author of the Year’. She is now Britain’s 13th wealthiest woman, wealthier than even the Queen. The woman is none other than Joanne Kathleen Rowling.</em></p>
		<p>‘It’s indeed a story of perseverance and determination to achieve the goal. I have another real-life story from nearer home which is no less tough, though not so much a success’. Anjali took out the newspaper clipping and started reading out. </p>
		<p><em>Damayanthi belongs to a small village in Odisha in the Ganjam district. She was married off at the age of fourteen. Even before she was twenty, her husband died. She became a burden for her in-laws. She went back to her father’s place and started eking out a living as a daily wager in the farms. In 2013 her mud hut was razed to the ground by the Pylon cyclone. She got a compensation of three lakh rupees from the government to rebuild her house but she had to buy the materials as well as build the house herself. She had no skill and except her old father she had none to help her. So, she learnt the job in three months and built her house brick by brick. Then there came the question of making a living. She wanted to utilise her skill as a mason. No contractor accepted a woman as a mason as it was entirely a male dominated arena. So, she accepted the work of a labourer and did everything from digging the foundation to laying the bricks to cementing the walls. She did so for six months and won the confidence of people around. Now she had earned a name as the only woman mason in the entire district.</em></p>
		<p>When Anjali concluded reading the news clipping Amina and Swapna clapped saying, ‘Woman power!’ Anjali said, Damayanthi’s case might not be a great success story but in her own way we can say that she has achieved independence with perseverance’.</p>
		<p>‘Indeed! it is really appreciable. I think apart from our own effort, it is important to understand that there is an invisible force that helps us when we are in trouble. Some call this force God. I would like to read out a story which tells that this force sustains us when all other things fail’. Hemant looked around for the group’s acquiescence. ‘Of course, do read’. They said almost in one voice.</p>
		<p><em>A pious man well behaved, sincere, devoted to his work and cared for people, once had a dream. In the dream he saw an image of himself walking along the beach. ‘Ah, this seems to be my life’ he thought. As he walked and glanced behind him, he saw another pair of footprints beside his on a long trail. ‘Seems God is with me’ he thought. Then, one pair of footprints disappeared for a while. ‘Oh, that was when I was a teenager and failed the exam. I had to face many taunts and feared about my future’ he remembered. Again, there were two pair of footprints for a while. Later, for another length of the trail the second pair of footprints disappeared. ‘Oh, I was thirty-two when I was seriously ill and almost lost my job. God seemed to have forsaken me then too’ he thought dejectedly and walked along. Suddenly he encountered the Creator. The dejected man complained bitterly. The Creator gave him a patient hearing and smiled. ‘When you saw two sets of footprints they were during your happy times in your life. I held your hand and danced along with you. What makes you think that the only footprints are yours? When you were in trouble I carried you on my shoulders and walked ahead. They are my footprints and not yours’ He said gently.</em></p>
		<p>All of them looked happy when Hemant concluded his story. ‘How beautiful! This story certainly tells us that when we are faced with challenges we should not give up but have confidence that the troubles will pass’. Amina commented.</p>
		<p>‘Yes. At the same time, there is also a saying that even God does not help those who do not help themselves’. Tejas grinned. </p>
		<p>‘Yes. All of us like to stay in our comfort zone. We should learn to come out of it to understand our potential. I have a story to illustrate this’. Swapna pulled out her story.</p>
		<p><em>Once upon a time there was a king who was very fond of birds. A merchant from a far-off land heard about the king’s passion and gifted him two Peregrine falcons. The falcons looked magnificent. The king had never seen such royal birds. He was elated and rewarded the merchant and sent the birds to his falconer to train them. </em></p>
		<p><em>The falcons were trained for months. One of them started flying majestically, soaring high in the sky, but the other did not even move from its branch since the day it arrived. The king summoned all the falconers and healers in his kingdom to tend the falcon, but no one could make the falcon fly. The king decided to reward whoever made the falcon fly. </em></p>
		<p><em>A poor farmer appeared in the court. The king was surprised. ‘How can a simple farmer train a majestic bird like a falcon?’ But the farmer was very confident and told the king that he could be executed if he failed. But if he was successful he should be given six acres of farming land. The king agreed.</em></p>
		<p><em>The next morning when the king looked out of his window he saw his second falcon taking flight high above the palace gardens. He summoned the farmer and asked him how he could make the falcon fly. The farmer smiled and replied. ‘It was very simple, your majesty. I simply cut the branch on which the bird was perched’.</em></p>
		<p>Swapna concluded the story.</p>
		<p>‘True. Many a time, we prefer sitting on a branch, clinging to things we are familiar with. But we need to overcome our fears, eliminate our stereotypical views, break our routine to understand our potential. A new challenge thrown to us helps us meet it boldly’. Raju commented. He continued, ‘I have a real story, an example from a species of geese. In Swapna’s story the farmer pushed the bird with a challenge. But here it happens naturally. I watched a documentary presented by BBC Earth and learnt how it happens’. He then narrated the process.</p>
		<p><em>Barnacle geese build their nests at high ranges to save their eggs and the hatchlings from foxes. However, the chicks would starve to death if they continue to be there on the high ranges. The barnacle geese don’t feed their chicks. So, the barnacle goslings only a few days old, compelled by pangs of hunger, push themselves from the comfort zone and take a 400 feet dive from the cliff.</em></p>
		<p>‘Wow, we have so much to learn from Nature, from other living creatures!’ Anjali commented.</p>
		<p> It was Amina’s turn now to give a story. </p>
		<p><em>High on a hilltop overlooking the beautiful city of Venice, Italy, there lived an old man who was a genius. Legend had it he could answer any question anyone might ask of him. Two of the local boys figured they could fool the old man, so they caught a small bird and headed for his residence.</em></p>
		<p><em>One of the boys held the little bird in his hands and asked the old man if the bird was dead or alive. Without hesitation the old man said, ‘Son, if I say to you that the bird is alive, you will close your hands and crush him to death. If I say the bird is dead, you will open your hands and he will fly away. You see, son, in your hands you hold the power of life and death’.</em></p>
		<p><em>In your hands you hold the seeds of failure or the potential for greatness. Your hands are capable but they must be used - and for the right things - to reap the rewards you are capable of attaining. </em></p>
		<p>‘If we think it is possible, ‘we can achieve anything in life’ said Gandhiji’ Amina concluded her story with this remark.</p>
		<p>Now Ashish gave the story he had brought.</p>
		<p><em>A young man asked Socrates what the secret to success was. Socrates asked the young man to meet him near the river the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the river. When the water got up to their neck, Socrates took the young man by surprise and ducked him into the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue.</em></p>
		<p><em>Socrates pulled the young man’s head out of the water and the first thing he did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked: ‘What did you want the most when you were there under the water?’ The boy replied: ‘Air’. Socrates said: ‘That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret’.</em> </p>
		<p>‘There is another aspect to this. Setting up a goal is one thing and making an effort is quite another. We need to work towards it’. Raju said. ‘Let me read out my story’. </p>
		<p><em>A young man went to a wise man and poured out his woes. He said, ‘I don’t find happiness in this world as I am not able to fulfil whatever I desire. I thought of buying a car when I would get a job. But by the time I got a decent job my old father passed away. I thought of taking my children on a holiday when I would get a promotion in my job. But promotion eluded me. There are several instances in my life that made me very unhappy. I wonder if I would be able to do what I want and will ever get some happiness in life’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The wise man smiled and took the young man into a nearby garden. There were long rows of roses planted. He said, ‘Look, go along one row of roses and pluck a best rose. But once you pass by a rose and go ahead, you cannot turn back’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The young man walked along the row of flowers. He saw big and small flowers, roses which looked fresh and colourful. He did not pluck any as he hoped to find better ones ahead. He almost came to the end of the row passing by all the flowers. The roses towards the end looked a little wilted and dry compared to what he passed by earlier. Since he was not supposed to go back, he chose whatever he thought was the best rose from among the roses at the end of the row. He returned to the wise man with the not-so-fresh a flower in hand. ‘Sir, I saw many beautiful fresh roses on my way but I walked ahead with the hope that I would get better ones ahead of me. With that hope I walked on without plucking any and towards the end I found only some wilted flowers. This was the best I could get from among those at the end of the row’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The wise man said, ‘Son, you left behind beautiful fresh roses and got only this not so fresh one at the end of the row. This row of flowers is like your life. And each rose is an opportunity of happiness for you. In the hope of better future, you let go of what was within your reach. In the bargain you reach the end of your life without enjoying the available happiness and are left with regret’.</em></p>
		<p>Raju concluded and looked around. Hemant said, ‘I think the story gives us several lessons. One is to set the goal and recognising the opportunity to achieve it. Second is, not to postpone something in the hope of getting better opportunity’.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, a bird in hand is better than two in the bush!’ Ashish grinned.</p>
		<p>‘And the third lesson is to have a strong desire to succeed should be coupled with timely action to achieve the goal’ said Hemant.</p>
		<p>‘Set small and big achievable goals in life and enjoy each one’. Raju smiled as he said.</p>
		<p>‘I now understand that motivation to succeed comes from the burning desire to achieve a goal. ‘Whenever the mind of man can conceive and believe the mind can achieve’. wrote Napoleon Hill which is something similar to what Gandhiji said. You have the power to achieve what you need, no matter how impossible it may seem. You just need to condition your mind and have belief that you can’. Ashish remarked before he concluded.</p>
		<p>‘So, what is important is the desire. A compelling, burning desire is the starting point of success. I think, just like a small fire cannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results’. Tejas looked pensive when he said this. </p>
		<p>‘Sometimes our parents have this burning desire for their children and push them to achieve their dreams’. Raju reflected on the death of his junior.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, there are so many pressures we have to meet in the process of achieving our targets..’. Anjali offered her comment and became a little pensive.</p>
		<p>‘Let us ask your aunt to talk about stress and coping with stress when we meet her next week’. Hemant suggested.</p>
