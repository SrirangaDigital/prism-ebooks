		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step’.</em></strong></p>
		<p class="quote-author"><strong><em> Jr. Martin Luther King </em></strong></p>
		<p>Nandita looked particularly relaxed when she met the group that Sunday.</p>
		<p>‘Stress? What is stress?’ she smiled. ‘Well, when you encounter something you think you cannot handle, you feel stressed out. For example, when you have a number of assignments with deadlines, a performance you will be rated on, meeting somebody who will be assessing you, encounter change in life and there are many such situations when you feel stressed. Examination is a big stress factor in a student’s life’. When she said the last point, everybody nodded their heads in agreement.</p>
		<p>‘Stress is a physical response to a situation. The heart beats increase, you get cramps, you feel butterflies in the stomach because the digestive function gets disrupted, you sweat profusely and you lose sleep and so on. The challenge is when this leads to an inability to ‘think straight’; a state that is a great hindrance in our work and if we are kept in a state of stress for long periods, it can also affect our health’.</p>
		<p>When Nandita mentioned this, all of them agreed. Raju said, ‘Yes, we have experienced this. While making a presentation or writing an examination we forget and our mind becomes blank’.</p>
		<p>‘I understand. When your body goes into a state of stress, you may feel agitated and aggressive towards others due to your body’s natural reaction to fight. This can negatively affect relationships and ruin your reputation’.</p>
		<p>‘And sometimes lead you to take your life’. Raju said ruefully.</p>
		<p>There was a moment’s silence at that remark as the same thought was passing in everyone’s mind.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, all stress is not bad. There is good stress and bad stress’. </p>
		<p>When she said that, all the youngsters exchanged glances in puzzle. Nandita continued to explain. ‘If there was no stress and without the brilliant ability to feel stress, humankind wouldn’t have survived and progressed. So, it’s good to feel some kind of compulsion or pressure to carry out a work successfully. That’s why we have deadlines which create a mild tension in us which in turn goads us to complete a task’.</p>
		<p>‘So, a little pressure is good. But sometimes, we feel it is too much..’. Hemant said hesitantly.</p>
		<p>Nandita smiled. ‘I understand. I read this episode somewhere but I don’t know who wrote it. Listen to what a speaker said once.</p>
		<p><em>He raised a glass of water to an audience and asked them ‘How much does this glass weigh?’The answers ranged from 50 grams to 200 grams. He then said, ‘the absolute weight does not really matter. What matters is how long you try to hold the glass. If you hold it for a minute it does not matter at all. If you hold it for an hour, you’ll have an ache in your arm. If you hold it for a day, an ambulance needs to be called. In each case it is the same weight. But the longer you hold it the heavier it becomes. It is the same with stress management. If we carry the burden for too long it becomes too heavy and you won’t be able to carry on.’ He further advised that just like the glass of water needs to be put down for a while and taken up after you refresh a bit so that the weight doesn’t become a burden you need to shift your worries’.</em></p>
		<p>Nandita looked around at the serious faces as she completed the sentence.</p>
		<p>‘Can we say that putting down the weight means not to do the work for a while and play truant?’ Tejas asked as his eyes twinkled mischievously. Everyone laughed at that.</p>
		<p>‘That’s it. It means manage the stress by relaxing for a while. There are various ways to de-stress. One sure way is to talk about the cause of stress. Just speak up. It helps’.</p>
		<p>‘I know how it works. Bottling up is the most dangerous thing, I have learnt’. Raju said. ‘I think one important thing in any relationship is not to bottle up emotions but to speak out’ Nandita said. ‘All of us feel low sometime or the other, for some reason or the other. But I would like to tell you all one thing. When you feel low in spirit don’t sit in your room and brood. A chain of negative thoughts would encircle you and pull you down further. You must come out, take a walk and speak to people around you. It would certainly help you’. </p>
		<p>‘Well, now we can look for ways of stress management illustrated in stories’. Nandita rose to leave.</p>
		<p>On the following Saturday, Amina was the first to read her story.</p>
		<p>‘All of you remember what the speaker said about holding the glass. Don’t you? I have a folk tale as a sequel to it’. She read her story.</p>
		<p><em>There was an aged widow in a village. She had four sons. She was not treated well in her old age by her sons and daughters-in-law. Her pride and self-respect did not allow her to speak to anyone about it. She kept her grievances to herself locked up inside her. Soon these woes turned into fat and she grew fatter and fatter. This became another cause for her family to taunt and ridicule her. </em></p>
		<p><em>One day she left home and came across an old and dilapidated roofless house on the outskirts of the village. She went in, turned to one wall and started speaking to her first son pouring out her grievances against him. The wall, unable to bear her grief, collapsed. Then she turned to the second wall and spoke out to her second son and related all her complaints she had. The second wall also collapsed. She turned to the third and fourth walls and grieved and grieved. All the four walls collapsed under her grief and the whole house came crashing down. Along with it the fat on her body also melted down and she became thin and light. She stepped out light and free.</em></p>
		<p>‘Oh. This story gives a powerful message that bottling up emotions and stress is harmful both to our body and mind’. Anjali observed.</p>
		<p>‘You are right. I learnt from my aunt that we have to speak up and seek help whenever we feel stressed out’. Raju offered his comment.</p>
		<p>Anjali took out her story. ‘I don’t know who wrote this story but I liked it very much’ she started reading it out.</p>
		<p><em>The carpenter I hired to help me restore an old farmhouse had just finished a rough first day on the job. A flat tire made him lose an hour of work, his electric saw quit working and now his ancient pick-up truck refused to start.</em></p>
		<p><em>While I drove him home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving, he invited me in to meet the family. As we walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches with both the hands.</em></p>
		<p><em>After opening the door, he underwent an amazing transformation. His face was wreathed in smiles, and he hugged his two small children and then gave his wife a kiss. Afterwards, he walked me to my car. We passed the tree and my curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen him do earlier.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Oh, that’s my worry tree,’ he replied. ‘I know I can’t help having worries on the job, but one thing for sure, worries don’t belong in the house with my wife and children. So, I just hang them up on the tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning, I pick them up again’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Funny thing is,’ he smiled, ‘when I come out in the morning to pick them up, there aren’t nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before’.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, this supports the speaker who said you put the stress down. Here the carpenter hangs it outside his home on the tree like we leave our footwear’. Hemant quipped. ‘I have another story which gives us some tips about coping with stress. Here it is’. Hemant read out his story.</p>
		<p><em>Once, a sage was travelling from one village to another along with his disciples. While they were travelling, they happened to pass by a river. They stopped near it and the sage said to one of his disciples, ‘I am thirsty. My throat is almost parched. Please get me some water from the river’</em></p>
		<p><em>The disciple walked up to the river. He noticed that the water was not clean. Some women were washing clothes and a buffalo was being given a good scrub by his master in the water. So, the water had become muddy and murky. The disciple didn’t feel like collecting that water and he walked back to the sage and said, ‘The river water is very dirty and muddy. I don’t think it is safe to drink it’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sage simply smiled.</em></p>
		<p><em>After about half an hour, the sage once again asked the disciple to go back to the river and fetch water. The disciple went to the river with the pitcher. This time he found the water clear. The mud had settled down and the water looked good to drink. He collected the water in the pitcher and took it to the sage.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sage looked at the water and said, ‘How did you clean the water?’ The disciple said ‘I just let it be’. The sage smiled once again. He knew that the disciple understood the meaning of ‘just let it be’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The mind is similar to the muddy water in the river. When it is disturbed or plagued by negative thoughts, just stay calm and ‘let it be’. Do not put undue effort to calm it down. Restoration of the calm is a process that happens naturally. When we are bogged down by some problem we should learn to ‘let it be’.</em></p>
		<p>Hemant stopped and took a deep breath and looked around.</p>
		<p>‘I think it is sensible to take a break when we feel too much stress’. Anjali said. </p>
		<p>‘But mind you, the breaks should be short..’. Tejas laughed.</p>
		<p>Swapna waved the sheet of paper in front of the group and grandly said, ‘Here, I have a wonderful story with me. I’ll read it out, of course. But I’ll ask a question after that. Now listen’.</p>
		<p>She started reading out.</p>
		<p><em>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had a few things in front of him.</em></p>
		<p>‘Oh, the story is philosophical I presume..’. Tejas interrupted her.</p>
		<p>‘Shh, listen first, don’t jump to conclusions’ Anjali glared at him as Swapna continued to read.</p>
		<p><em>When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full.</em></p>
		<p><em>They agreed that it was.</em></p>
		<p><em>The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly.</em></p>
		<p><em>The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.</em></p>
		<p><em>The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.</em></p>
		<p><em>Of course, the sand filled up everything else.</em></p>
		<p><em>He asked once more if the jar was full.</em></p>
		<p><em>The students responded with a unanimous ‘yes’. The professor then produced a glass of water from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.</em></p>
		<p><em>The students laughed.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Now,’ said the professor as the laughter subsided, ‘I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.</em></p>
		<p><em>The golf balls are the important things—your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favourite passions—and if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.</em></p>
		<p><em>The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house and your car.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sand is everything else—the small stuff.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘If you put the sand into the jar first,’ he continued, ‘there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.</em></p>
		<p><em>The same goes for life.</em></p>
		<p><em>If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Spend time with your children.</em></p>
		<p><em>Spend time with your parents. Visit the grandparents. Take your spouse out to dinner.</em></p>
		<p><em>There will always be time to clean the house, fix the disposal or deal with things from your job. Take care of the golf balls first—the things that really matter.</em></p>
		<p><em>Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.</em></p>
		<p>‘OK. The story is about setting priorities in life, if that is your question’. Tejas offered the answer before Swapna asked her question.</p>
		<p>‘That’s fine. The professor talks about people in general. But my first question is what should be our priorities as students?’</p>
		<p>‘Simple. Studies’. Hemant was quick to answer.</p>
		<p>‘Well, the second question is, if you are asked to make a list of your priorities, what will your list look like?’ Swapna asked.</p>
		<p>‘I got an idea. This time, when we put this up on the notice board let’s make it a little interactive. Let’s ask what Swapna asked us and see what the general opinion will be’. said Raju.</p>
		<p>They all agreed with him.</p>
		<p>They wrote down the two questions below the story that Swapna read out and decided to post the sheet on the notice board assigned to them.</p>
		<p>It was Raju’s turn to read his story.</p>
		<p><em>Once there was a picturesque village in a beautiful valley. The village was blessed with ample sunshine and rain throughout the year. People from the village used to grow the sweetest and most fragrant mangoes.</em></p>
		<p><em>As fate would have it, it did not at all rain for a year. The orchards started drying up leaving all the villagers worried and parched. Perturbed by their precarious situation, the villagers decided to go to the sage who was camping outside their village.</em></p>
		<p><em>The sage met all the villagers with great benevolence. He offered them water and heard their problem. He then told them a joke. It was a funny joke and the villagers roared in laughter. Then the sage asked them to come back the next day.</em></p>
		<p><em>The next day too, the villagers gathered and recounted their problem to the sage. The sage told them the same joke. This time only a few people smiled.</em></p>
		<p><em>On the third day the discouraged villagers repeated their problem to him again. The sage repeated the joke he had told them earlier for a third time. This time no one laughed at all.</em></p>
		<p><em>Then the sage smiled and said, ‘You don’t laugh at the same joke over and over, then why do you always worry about the same problem?’</em></p>
		<p><em>He then encouraged the villagers to dig a stream from the mountain to the valley which got the much-needed water to their orchards.</em></p>
		<p>‘If we worry over a problem over and over then it gets magnified and we feel more stressed out. Instead we should learn to focus our energies in resolving the problem and move on’. Raju concluded with his observation.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, the holy man directed the villagers to think practically and work out a solution rather than ruing over the problem’.</p>
		<p>‘I was thinking of the story where the magician tried to help the mouse and changed it several times into bigger animals and ultimately changed it back into a mouse. It is better if we concentrate on how to overcome a problem rather than worrying and getting anxious’. Tejas said softly.</p>
		<p>‘So, if we don’t develop the inner strength, any amount of help from others will not really take us out of a difficult situation’. Tejas concluded the story with his remarks.</p>
		<p>‘Otherwise we have to develop what they call <strong><em>coping strategies</em></strong> if we cannot change the situation immediately<strong><em>’</em></strong> Raju offered his comment.</p>
		<p>Amina said, ‘I will give you a more contemporary story about the great violinist Itzhak Perlman. <em>Polio in his childhood crippled Isaac Perlman. He was able to walk only with braces and crutches. One evening, Perlman was scheduled to play a difficult, challenging violin concerto. In the middle of the performance one of the strings on his violin snapped with a loud noise that filled the entire auditorium. The orchestra immediately stopped playing and the audience held its collective breath. The assumption was that he would have to put on his braces, pick up his crutches and leave the stage or someone would have to come out with another string or replace the violin. After a brief pause, Perlman set his violin under his chin and signalled to the conductor to begin.</em></p>
		<p><em>One person in the audience reported what happened: ‘I know it is impossible to play a violin concerto with only three strings’. But that night, Perlman refused to know it. You could see him modulating, changing and recomposing in his head. At one point it sounded as if he were re-tuning the strings to get a new sound that had never been heard before. When he finished, there was an awesome silence that filled the room. Then people rose and cheered. Perlman smiled, wiped his brow, and raised the bow of his violin to quiet them. He spoke, quietly in a pensive tone, ‘you know, our job is to make music with what remains’</em><strong>.</strong></p>
		<p>‘I have read this story earlier. Actually, we have no proof that Perlman’s brilliant improvisation actually happened. However, the message in the episode is loud and clear. There is no point in getting distressed when the unexpected happens. We need to cope with what we have, and we may end up with brilliant results if we really try’. Raju completed his sentence with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, I think this also speaks for Perlman’s positive attitude’ commented Amina.</p>
		<p>‘I’ll give you a story which is like a parable. But surely you’ll like it’. Anjali was confident that her story would appeal to all. She then read her story out.</p>
		<p><em>In a forest, a pregnant deer is about to give birth. She finds a remote grass field near a strong-flowing river. This seems a safe place. Suddenly labour pains begin. At the same moment, dark clouds gather around above and lightning starts a forest fire. She looks to her left and sees a hunter with his bow extended pointing at her. To her right, she spots a hungry lion approaching her. What can the pregnant deer do? She is in labour! What will happen? Will the deer survive? Will she give birth to a fawn? Will the fawn survive? Or will everything be burnt by the forest fire? Will she perish to the hunters’ arrow? Will she die a horrible death at the hands of the hungry lion approaching her? She is constrained by the fire on the one side and the flowing river on the other and boxed in by her natural predators. What does she do?</em></p>
		<p><em>She focuses on giving birth to a new life. The sequence of events that follows are - Lightning strikes and blinds the hunter. - He releases the arrow which zips past the deer and strikes the hungry lion. - It starts to rain heavily and the forest fire is slowly doused by the rain. - The deer gives birth to a healthy fawn. </em></p>
		<p>‘This story teaches us so many lessons on exercising choices, setting up priorities and positive thinking. In our life too, there are moments of choice when we are confronted on all sides with negative thoughts and possibilities. Maybe we can learn from the deer. The priority of the deer, at that given moment of stress and anxiety, was simply to give birth to a baby. She concentrated on her creation, on continuation of life against all adversities’. Anjali herself gave the concluding remarks. Everyone nodded in assent.</p>
		<p>Raju took out his story with this observation. ‘There are challenges in life. How we encounter the challenges depends on how we look at them and how we deal with them’. Then he read the story.</p>
		<p><em>Once an unhappy young man came to an old master and told he had a very sad life and asked for a solution. The old Master instructed the unhappy young man to put a handful of salt in a glass of water and then to drink it. ‘How does it taste?’ the Master asked. ‘Not good at all,’ spat the apprentice.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Master chuckled and then asked the young man to take another handful of salt and put it in the lake. The two walked in silence to the nearby lake and when the apprentice swirled his handful of salt into the lake, the old man said, ‘Now drink from the lake’.</em></p>
		<p><em>As the water dripped down the young man’s chin, the Master asked, ‘How does it taste?’‘Good!’ remarked the apprentice. ‘Do you taste the salt?’ asked the Master. ‘No,’ said the young man.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Master sat beside this troubled young man, took his hands, and said, ‘the challenges of life is pure salt; no more, no less. The amount of challenges remains the same. But the amount we taste depends on the container we put it into. So, when you encounter adverse circumstances, the only thing you can do is to enlarge your sense of things... stop being a glass. Become a lake!’</em></p>
		<p>‘Hmm... isn’t it too philosophical?’ grumbled Hemant. ‘Well, we have to learn to expand our sense..’. Tejas said mischievously spreading his hands wide.</p>
		<p>Ashish then read out his story.</p>
		<p><em>Long, long ago, there was a king when no one ever knew that something like a footwear existed. Even the king had to walk barefoot. Because of this he was forever bruising and scraping his feet over hard rocky soil or would slip and fall on damp soil. One day, completely exasperated with this problem, he turned to his trusty minister and ordered: ‘I want you to carpet the entire kingdom with leather, or it’s off with your head!’</em></p>
		<p><em>The poor minister sat up half the night thinking about this impossible task and knowing that he would surely lose his head if he does not come up with a right solution. Suddenly, just as the sun began to rise, his fear turned to joy. He had an idea. Bounding from his bed, he ran to the leather shoe maker.</em></p>
		<p><em>When the king awoke the next morning, he jumped quickly out of bed and hurried to the royal window to view his leather carpet at least around his palace. Seeing not one inch of leather carpet anywhere he began bellowing for the minister roaring wildly. ‘Minister, Where’s my minister? I’ll have his head!’</em></p>
		<p><em>At that very moment, the minister appeared at the king’s door clutching a pair of well-designed leather slippers in his hands. ‘Oh! your highness, please be so kind as to try these first,’ he begged. The king agreed and in the wink of an eye the minister had slipped the world’s first pair of leather slippers onto the king’s royal feet.</em></p>
		<p><em>Instantly the king’s anger turned to delight. Shuffling around the room with the softness of the finest leather in the kingdom beneath his feet, all he could do was smile with every step.</em></p>
		<p>‘What a clever way to tackle the difficult king!’ Anjali giggled.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes we may find very simple answers to problems which look very complex’. Raju commented.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, we just have to look for them’. Swapna added.</p>
		<p>Amina said, ‘I have another very contemporary story. The story and the commentary on the story were given by Sunder Pitchai’. At the mention of the name Sunder Pitchai, everyone became alert and got ready to hear the story.</p>
		<p><em>At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and sat on a lady. She started screaming out of fear. With a panic-stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach. Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky. The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ... it landed on another lady in the group. Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.</em></p>
		<p><em>The waiter rushed forward to their rescue. In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter. The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt. When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.</em></p>
		<p>Amina paused, ‘After narrating this incident Sundar Pichai, Head of Google Chrome, offered his observations’. And she read on.</p>
		<p><em>Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach responsible for their histrionic behavior? If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed? He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos. It is not the cockroach, but the inability of those people to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach, that disturbed the ladies.</em></p>
		<p><em>I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it’s my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.</em></p>
		<p><em>It’s not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.</em></p>
		<p><em>More than the problem, it’s my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘</em>Excellent. We often find ourselves in situations we don’t like and can’t change. We can, however, learn to think not in a conventional way but a little differently to cope with the situation’ said Nandita who came in quietly as Ashish was reading out his story and also listened to Amina’s narration of Sundar Pichai’s speech.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, if we learn to plan and manage our time efficiently, we can be free of tensions and stress to a large extent. Our next topic for discussion will be Time Management’. She announced before she left.</p>
		<p>[The questions they put up on the notice board were: </p>
		<p>‘What should be our priorities as students? If you are asked to make a list of your priorities what will your list look like?’</p>
		<p>The questions attracted a large number of responses from students. Almost all students put studies as the first priority. That was followed by looking after parents, giving back to society, getting a job, earning money, raising a family and so on.]</p>
