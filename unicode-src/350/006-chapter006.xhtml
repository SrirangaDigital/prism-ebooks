		<p class="quote-author"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Dwight D. Eisenhower</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
		<p>When Nandita entered the study, she noticed that the group was not complete. Hemant was not there. ‘He said he may not come today as he has to complete the assignment and submit it on time’. Raju offered an explanation. Just as Raju was completing his sentence Hemant breezed in. ‘Oh, I didn’t want to miss this session as I very much need tips to manage my time’ he said rather sheepishly.</p>
		<p>Nandita smiled. ‘First have a glass of water and relax. I know time management is very important for all of us. It is specially so in a student’s career. As I said earlier, if we manage our time well there will be almost no room for stress and the need for stress management. Planning is what we should learn. A bit of planning and preparation gives us confidence and also helps us to utilise our time maximally. Planning helps in everything we do’ She stopped, as she caught Tejas looking askance.</p>
		<p>‘Isn’t it very boring to plan <strong><em>everything</em></strong> in life? It will make us so robot-like..’. Tejas ventured to say.</p>
		<p>‘Of course, it is very true. Planning should also include a margin for relaxation for you to sometime let your hair down and not to care..’. everyone laughed as Nandita responded.</p>
		<p>‘Let us take a very simple example. How many of you have said ‘lack of time’, and not answered a question or two in the exam, sometime or the other?’</p>
		<p>Everyone’s hand went up.</p>
		<p>‘You see that’s because of lack of planning and time management and not because of ‘lack of time’. You need to learn to ‘budget’ time given the number of answers to write. Allot time for each answer and try not to overshoot’.</p>
		<p>‘But I always overshoot time for my first answer’. Hemant said honestly.</p>
		<p>‘Well, let me give you a specific example. Let’s say you have a three-hour exam and you have to answer six questions. So, each question gets thirty minutes. But when you budget you should give yourself only twenty five minutes for each question. Then you have a margin of thirty minutes. These thirty minutes should be kept for reading and editing, correcting and adding points. So even if you overshoot the time for a couple of questions you can adjust the reminder of the time for the editing etc’.</p>
		<p>‘It makes a lot of sense to me’. Swapna said.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, when you get the question paper in hand, run through all the questions, go through the instructions carefully and mark the questions you decide to answer if there are choices given. Prioritise the questions you would like to answer first, second and so on. This will take about five minutes. Then think of the points you would like to present and go ahead and write. You may rehearse this pattern with a model question paper’.</p>
		<p>‘The problem comes when there are a hundred objective types of questions and a limited time’. Anjali said.</p>
		<p>‘The same strategy should work. Only the time and the number of questions are different. Again, it’s planning that matters. Time management and planning and preparation go hand in hand’. ‘Have you ever thought how your mother entertains so many guests to dinner so many times? Have you observed how she plans the menu, readying the ingredients and actual time of cooking and laying the table and so on so effortlessly? It’s all because of a perfect planning’. </p>
		<p>‘Yes, when my mother is in the kitchen everything is in order. But once my dad decides to cook for the day... it looks like a battlefield’. Ashish said as everyone laughed.</p>
		<p>‘When we read a recipe, it mentions all the ingredients required: quantity, procedure, preparation required and the cooking time as well as number of servings’. Anjali offered her observation.</p>
		<p>‘Well, from the kitchen to spacecraft, everything depends on planning, preparation and time management. When you see the launch of any rocket you must have observed the precision with which they work. They plan even a fraction of a second’. Nandita recalled her visit to Satish Dhawan Space Research Centre SHAR, with a lot of satisfaction and pride for the scientists.</p>
		<p>My mother always keeps a ‘to-do’ list posted on the fridge door’. Ashish said.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, a task-list is always useful. Task lists are used in most of the fields like self-management, business management, project management and software development. In fact, it may involve more than one list’. Nandita said.</p>
		<p>‘I do plan my time but sometimes I have more work than I can manage and on some other days I am totally free’ Ashish looked a little troubled.</p>
		<p>‘Well, enjoy it when you are free’ Tejas offered his lofty opinion.</p>
		<p>‘That’s because perhaps you need to relook at your planning’. Nandita said. ‘The most dreaded word you should remember when you want to manage time is ‘procrastination’. In the epic ‘Mahabharatha’, addressing King Yudhishthira, Bhishma said, ‘the one that provides for the future and the one who possesses the presence of mind, always enjoys happiness. The man of procrastination, however, is the looser’. With these words Nandita left after suggesting that they should collect some more stories on this theme.</p>
		<p>The group collected some stories on time management.</p>
		<p>Ashish said, ‘This is a story we all read when we were children. But now when we read it we can draw lessons on time management’ and he proceeded to read.</p>
		<p><em>In a field one summer day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Why not come and chat with me,’ said the Grasshopper, ‘instead of toiling and moiling in that way?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I am helping to lay up food for the winter,’ said the Ant, ‘and recommend you to do the same’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Why bother about winter?’ said the Grasshopper; ‘We have got plenty of food at present’. But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.</em></p>
		<p><em>When the winter came, the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger - while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper knew: It is best to prepare for days of need.</em></p>
		<p>‘This is not only about time management. It also speaks a lot about planning and preparation’. Tejas offered his comment.</p>
		<p>‘But don’t you think all the three are interknit, one depending on the other?’ Hemant commented.</p>
		<p>‘I agree. In fact, goal setting, planning, preparation and managing time, all these are interconnected’. Raju said, ‘Let’s look at Time Management and Goal Setting first’.</p>
		<p>Swapna stood up and held a sheet of paper up. ‘I have two stories here. I’ll read them out one after the other. Then I want us to discuss the stories vis-a-vis time management, planning and preparation and also what our goals in life should be’.</p>
		<p>Everyone in the room looked interested and prepared themselves to listen to her. </p>
		<p>Swapna read the stories.</p>
		<p><strong>1.</strong><em> A corporate executive, on a holiday in a small, Greek sea-coast village, was strolling by the docks and taking in the local colour. He complimented one fisherman on the quality of his catch.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘How long did it take you to get all those fish?’ he asked.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Not very long,’ answered the Greek. ‘An hour or two’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Then why didn’t you stay out longer to catch more?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Shrugging, the Greek explained that his catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.</em></p>
		<p><em>The executive asked, ‘But what do you do with the rest of your time?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children and take a nap with my wife. In the evening, I go to the village to see my friends, dance a little, play the bouzouki and sing songs. I have a full life’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The executive said, ‘Well I have an MBA from Harvard and I’m sure I can help you. You should start by fishing longer every day. You’ll catch extra fish that you can sell. With the revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring you, you can buy a second boat and a third one and so on, until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.</em></p>
		<p><em>You can ship fish to markets all around the world. In time, you can then move to New York City to direct your huge enterprise’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘How long would that take?’ asked the Greek.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,’ replied the executive.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘And after that?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘When your business gets really big, you can sell stock and make millions!’ exclaimed the executive with zeal.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Millions? Really? And after that?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘After that you’ll be able to retire, live in a small village near the coast, sleep late, play with your grandchildren, catch a few fish, take a nap with your wife and spend your evenings singing, dancing, and playing the bouzouki with your friends’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The fisherman said, ‘I am already doing it all,’ and went his way, leaving the Management graduate gazing at him. </em></p>
		<p><strong>2.</strong><em> There was a rich person living in a small town. All his life he kept on accumulating wealth and within twenty years, he had treasured enough money. He had enough money to buy the whole town, but he never helped anybody in life. He used to be very happy and proud about his bank balance. But he never used his money; he never tried to spend even a paisa on his wishes, clothes or food. He spent all his life in accumulating wealth.</em></p>
		<p><em>He was so busy in earning money that he never realized that he had become old now. His whole life had passed away. He never enjoyed or celebrated and spent happy moments with his family.</em></p>
		<p><em>One night, the Yamraj (God of Death) came.</em></p>
		<p><em>Yamraj said, ‘Your time is over. You have to come with me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The man replied, ‘But, I have not lived my life. I was busy working. I need some time to use my wealth that I have accumulated over the years through hard working’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Yamraj said, ‘No, I can’t give you any more time. It is limited and can’t be granted more than what is specified’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The man said, ‘See, I have so much of wealth. I will give you half of my wealth. Will you give me one more year?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The Yamraj said, ‘No, that is not possible’</em></p>
		<p><em>The man said – Ok, I will give you 80% of my wealth. Will you give me at least a month?</em></p>
		<p><em>The Yamraj said – No.</em></p>
		<p><em>The man said, ‘Ok, I will give you all my wealth, can I get one hour in return?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The Yamraj said, ‘You can’t buy time with your wealth’.</em></p>
		<p><em>At last the man said, ‘Give me few minutes, I want to write a letter. Please grant it as my last wish’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Yamraj agreed.</em></p>
		<p><em>The man wrote a letter to the people of his town. In his letter he wrote –</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Whosoever gets this letter should pass on my message to others. For the whole of my life, I worked really hard to get rich. Today I have a huge amount of wealth. But today I could not even borrow an hour of my life with the whole of my wealth. So, I want to convey to all to value your time and life. Live in present. It is good to work hard, but don’t forget to live your life. Wealth cannot buy you time in life. It cannot buy your past. Time that is lost is lost forever. Time is precious, don’t waste it. Life is a beautiful gift of God. Live it fully. Help others’</em></p>
		<p>The room was filled with pensive silence when she concluded the second story. </p>
		<p>Raju was the first to break the silence. ‘Don’t these stories speak about planning and management and also more importantly what our priorities should be in life? We should understand what we should do with our time on hand, in the second story. You should spend time with your loved ones, your faith, your education, your dreams, a worthy cause, teaching or mentoring others’</p>
		<p>Amina said, ‘I agree. We could link this up with the story of the professor who put these big rocks first in the jar or you’ll never be able to get them in at all. Plan time-slots for your big issues before anything else, or the inevitable issues like sand and water will fill up your days and you won’t fit the big issues in’.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, the first story needs to be read very carefully. Otherwise we might be misled to think that all the efforts, management of resources and time lead to nothing’. Tejas offered his observation.</p>
		<p>‘Very true. A superficial reading may make us think that both the fisherman and the corporate person have the same goal and what he says seems frivolous as both of them talk about the result. But the difference is, while the corporate person speaks about security, the fisherman achieves it without the security for future. What is important is to know where to stop’. </p>
		<p>As the discussion was going on, Nandita quietly entered the room and sat in a corner thinking how mature the youngsters’ discussion sounded. This mindset should get transferred to the youth at large, she thought.</p>
		<p>‘While all of us strive to achieve our personal interests and pursue our goals in life we also should tread softly and not step on others’ toes’. Nandita said.</p>
		<p>‘Can we say that we should negotiate our way through the crowd so that there are no accidents and no casualties..’. Swapna vented out her thoughts.</p>
		<p>‘Very well said. The next topic for discussion is ‘interpersonal relations’’. Nandita announced before leaving.</p>
