		<p>‘Human beings are not islands. Whether we are at home with our family or out in the society or at work, we are constantly interacting with people around us. We need to build positive relationship with them to carry on with our life smoothly. ‘Nandita paused and continued. </p>
		<p>‘I think it is like the picture you gave us the other day, ME with a shadow showing WE’ Swapna said.</p>
		<p>‘Precisely. We live in a society and we are not isolated beings but whatever we do or say has an impact on people around us. When we think of interpersonal relations we think of the various feelings people evoke in us. Here is a beautiful story of feelings’.</p>
		<p><em>Once there was an island where all the feelings lived together. One day there came a storm in the sea and the island was about to drown. Every feeling was scared but Love made a boat to escape. All the feelings jumped in the boat except for one feeling. Love got down to see who it was... it was Ego! Love tried and tried but Ego didn’t move. Everyone asked Love to leave Ego and come to the boat but Love was meant to Love. It remained with Ego. All other feelings were left alive but Love. </em></p>
		<p><em>Love died because of Ego!</em></p>
		<p>Think over it…</p>
		<p>‘I think our relationship with people around us is like the hours in the clock. When the hands are on 12 and 1, it is one o’clock. But when the hands are on 12 and 2, it is two o’clock. So, each number has a different relation with every other number. So are the relationships between people, each being unique’. Anjali said.</p>
		<p>‘Beautiful analogy, but don’t forget that all these numbers gain meaning when the hands keep moving and complete a cycle of 24 hours to make a day. If the hands stop at any point, the cycle cannot be completed to make the day. And don’t forget that it is the minute hand which guides the hour hand. We can say that if the hour hand is called <em>relationship</em> the minute hand is the <em>attitude</em>’. Raju explained further.</p>
		<p>Everyone smiled at the extended analogy.</p>
		<p>Ashish said softly, ‘Both the hands are together on each number everyday…’</p>
		<p>Nandita smiled, ‘Wonderful observation. Let us call it the relationship one enjoys with oneself. It could be a time for self-introspection, indulging in oneself… call what you like. It is also important that we give ourselves some quality time. So, we can say, interpersonal relations begin with family and extend to society. The familial bonds and the societal bonds sustain us and help us from drifting away. Here is a small illustration’. </p>
		<p class="verse">
			<em>Mother is flying a kite. </em><br />
			<em>Her son is watching her carefully. </em><br />
			<em>After some time, the son says ‘Mom, because of the string the kite is not able to go any further higher’.</em><br />
			<em>Hearing this, the mother smiles and breaks the string. </em><br />
			<em>The kite goes higher and then shortly after that, it comes and falls on the ground. </em><br />
			<em>The child is very dejected and sad.</em><br />
			<em>The mother sits next to him and calmly explains: </em><br />
			<em>‘Son, in life we reach a certain level and then we feel that there are certain things that are not letting us grow any further like home, family, friends, culture etc. </em><br />
			<em>We feel we want to be free from those strings which we believe are stopping us from going higher. </em><br />
			<em>But, remember son, that our home, family, friends and culture are the things that will help us stay stable at the heights. </em><br />
			<em>If we try to break away from those strings our condition will be similar to the kite we will fall down soon’.</em>
		</p>
		<p>‘At the first instant, when we are young and are impatient to get our freedom, it looks as though the familial bonds pull us back, restrict us. But we should remember that culture, home, family, friends and relationships help keep us stable while we are flying high... this is the first thing we should remember in life’.</p>
		<p> ‘It is very important to have good friends who offer support when in trouble’.</p>
		<p>‘I think we share a lot of things among friends than with parents’. Tejas confessed.</p>
		<p>‘It is natural as you feel more comfortable in your own age group. It does help if you share your anxieties with friends’.</p>
		<p>‘But we are not alone in this world. Sometimes some people around us have negative attitude towards us and won’t that affect us and our relationships?’ Hemant expressed his doubt.</p>
		<p>‘A good question. As all the five fingers are not of the same size and each one is relevant in its own way all the people around us are relevant. But we should learn to ‘negotiate’ with them just like we negotiate puddles and potholes on the road when we are driving on the road’. Listen to this conversation between a guru and his disciple’.</p>
		<p><em>‘If you had Rs. 86,400 in your account and someone stole Rs. 10 from you. Would you be upset and throw the remaining amount Rs. 86,390 away at the person who took your Rs.10?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘You would move on and live. Right? In the same way, we have 86,400 seconds each day. Don’t let someone’s negative 10 seconds ruin the remaining 86,390 seconds of your day’.</em></p>
		<p>‘I have a story which tells us how the familial relations can help us grow into people with positive thoughts’ Swapna said and started reading her very short story, which was almost like an episode.</p>
		<p><em>Those were the days of Board Exam results. All youngsters and their parents waited anxiously for the results. I met my son’s friend Vishal on the day of his results. He greeted me as he normally does, we spoke for a while about his gym and then I waived him goodbye. I didn’t ask him about his results because I thought I should give him some space and he would tell me if he wanted to. It would make him uncomfortable if he didn’t score well. When I reached home, I discussed it over a cup of tea with my son. At night someone posted a message in my son’s group that his friend had failed in the exam. My son told me about it. I told my son to counsel him after he settled down a bit. I met him a few days later. He didn’t look dejected. He told me about his results. And went on to tell me how his day was when the results were out. But it was amazing that his parents did not react as normally some parents do. He said that his dad came home early that day to be with him. He got him his favourite chocolate. On seeing the chocolate, he cried because he let his parents down. But his dad was sensitive and caring. He put his hands around Vishal’s shoulders and told him that he was the most precious person in his life and it was not really very important to him if he failed in his exams. He could always try again. He should ‘rise from failure and do well next time’. Both his parents cheered him and the boy got confidence that he could try again.</em></p>
		<p>‘Wonderful. This is in fact a message for parents. Children need love and care when they face failure in life. What really matters is family support and once that understanding is offered, then they will never look back but only look up. Parents need to be cheerleaders to their children, and then there is nothing that can put them down’. Nandita said as nobody spoke. ‘In fact, I have a small episode that a friend of mine told me one day. It happened in his own family. Let me tell you about it’ she continued.</p>
		<p><em>Arvind’s eyes were aching. He longed to go to bed. But no. He should keep awake. He should read this chapter in his Chemistry textbook and explain it to his father. This has been happening for the past one month. Arvind was by no means a dull boy. But somehow, he had been getting distracted each time he opened a chapter in the book. Anything could distract him these days... a cricket match, a movie, or even just sitting with friends guffawing. After all that he felt so tired and exhausted that the moment he opened his textbook he would feel sleepy. His father was very disturbed by this change in Arvind.</em></p>
		<p><em>Arvind was on the threshold of manhood. He stood as tall as his father. ‘I can’t slap this boy’ his father thought. The boy would feel terribly hurt if his father chided him for his irresponsibility.</em></p>
		<p><em>That night, after dinner Arvind opened his Physics textbook. He didn’t even complete one page and he felt sleepy. He flung himself on bed leaving the textbook open on the table. Next morning, he found his book on his father’s table. Arvind was a bit puzzled.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Son, can you explain this to me? Last night I didn’t get sleep and I came to your room and saw the book open on your table. I started reading it to pass time. I didn’t really get the concept clear..’. his father told him after breakfast, holding up the chapter to him. ‘Let me read it dad,’ Arvind took the book, read the chapter and taught his father. This happened several times... on one pretext or the other his father would come to Arvind asking him to explain something from his Chemistry, Biology or Mathematics books. His father would say he needed to understand the chapter so that it would help him do some work or the other. Arvind would read up and explain it to his father.</em></p>
		<p><em>Now a successful Nuclear Physicist, Arvind looks back at his silly irresponsible teenage period and his heart is filled with gratitude for his father who bailed him out without even appearing to be doing so.</em></p>
		<p>When Nandita concluded her narration all the youngsters were filled with admiration for Arvind’s father. It was obvious that the entire group was thinking of their college mate who took his life because he failed in exams. ‘If only he had the family support... if he had a father like Arvind’s..’. was the thought running in their heads.</p>
		<p>Raju was the first to break the silence: ‘I think when our parents are a little harsh with us we should also understand their anxiety. I have a story to illustrate my point. This is a story about the 6<sup>th</sup> century Sanskrit poet Bharavi’. He narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>Bharavi showed signs of scholarship even as a child. The world around him recognised him for his wisdom, scholarship and all the other good qualities associated with it. However, his father who was a great scholar himself, never said a word of praise for his worthy son. Bharavi was very anxious to hear a word of appreciation from his father. He waited patiently but it never happened. He complained to his mother about his father’s attitude towards him. The mother was touched by her son’s eagerness and decided to speak to her husband.</em></p>
		<p><em>In the meantime, Bharavi was unable to contain his disappointment. His disappointment turned into indignation and at last he decided to kill his father by dropping a stone and smashing his head. In the dead of the night he proceeded to carry out his mission. </em></p>
		<p><em>He stopped at the door of the room where his father slept. He heard some voices. It was the voices of his parents. ‘Oh, they are awake!’He listened to their conversation. His mother was telling her husband that the son was hurt and implored that his father should show some appreciation and encourage him. His father’s response stunned Bharavi. His father said, ‘I do know my son’s worth. I feel very proud to see his progress. However, I restrain myself from showering praise on him like the rest of the world. Do you think it is easy for me when I withhold my praises for him? It hurts me too to exercise restraint. I am afraid if I too show my appreciation he may become complacent and stop growing. He has a very bright future and I don’t want to see it curbed’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Bharavi was much moved. The next morning, he confessed his guilt and asked his father’s forgiveness. </em></p>
		<p>‘We should understand that our parents are our first well-wishers and always mean well whatever they do. I have another story. I heard this from a swamiji of Hare Krishna movement. Here it is’. Hemant narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>Once, a crab was walking on the sea shore. As it was walking it was looking back at its own footprints and was admiring the footprints it left behind. Then the waves came and erased the footprints. The crab got upset.</em></p>
		<p><em>It looked at the ocean and said, ‘Hey, why did you do that? I always thought you were my friend…’</em></p>
		<p><em>The waves of the ocean replied, ‘I saw the fisherman coming towards you. I thought your footprints would give you away. I wanted to save you from the fisherman, so I washed them away. That’s all’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘</em>This is true in our relationships too. Sometimes we get upset with the actions of people just like the crab was with the waves. But the intention of the waves was not really to wash away the crab’s footprints but to save him from the fisherman. Similarly, sometimes the actions of people may look unpleasant but the intention could be to help us. So, we should not judge by the actions but think of the intension behind the action’.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes we judge people by their looks. We consider some people inferior to us but, it may not be so’. Tejas said. ‘Listen to this story. This is based on the short story written by V. S. Khandekar’ </p>
		<p><em>Once, a king built a beautiful temple. The temple had magnificent carvings both on the outside and inner walls. He called expert sculptors and decorated the temple with beautiful sculptures. He installed a very imposing deity in the sanctum sanctorum. The walls of the sanctum sanctorum were studded with precious stones. Beside the deity, he kept a huge ceremonial lamp made of solid gold. When the huge lamp with five wicks was lit, the entire space was resplendent with glittering jewels. The king was very happy with the effect of light inside the temple. He would make a visit to the temple every evening to worship the deity.</em></p>
		<p><em>One day, after his prayers, when he looked around with satisfaction and pride he saw a matchstick beside the wick of the gold lamp. He thought the small matchstick spoiled the aesthetic beauty of the resplendent gold lamp. So, he called the priest to his palace and ordered him not to leave the matchstick anywhere near the temple after lighting the lamp. Next day the palace had a very agitated priest who wanted to see the king urgently. But no, the king was busy. The priest waited the whole day but did not get an audience with the king. He went back dejected.</em></p>
		<p><em>That evening, as usual the king went to the temple. The entire sanctum sanctorum was dark. Nothing was visible, neither the deity nor the glistening gold lamp. The agitated king was about to call out the priest when he heard a voice from the sanctum sanctorum. ‘O king, don’t blame the priest. You are responsible for this darkness. You thought the lowly looking matchstick should be cast away. You did not realize the worth of this small matchstick which is useful in removing the soot from the wick from time to time and keep the bright lamp lit all the time’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The king realized his mistake and never gave such orders again.</em></p>
		<p>‘We should not judge people by their unassuming looks’ quipped Swapna.</p>
		<p>‘Remember the cracked pot? Nothing is totally useless. The worth of a thing or a person is in the work they perform’. Anjali added.</p>
		<p>‘When we are talking about judging people, I would like to give a story which almost takes off from the crab story’. Hemant started reading out his story.</p>
		<p><em>In ancient Indian scriptures like the Puranas, we have an eminent mystic called Ashtavakra. Once, Emperor Janaka convened a huge conference of pundits from all over the country to discuss the ultimate truth. Janaka offered the winner a reward of one thousand cows with their horns plated with gold and decorated with jewels. A great debate ensued, in which Ashtavakra’s father also took part. At dusk Ashtavakra came to know that his father was losing to a renowned pundit called Vandina who defeated all the other pundits. He was only twelve years of age then. He was called Ashtavakra as his body was deformed and twisted at eight places.</em></p>
		<p><em>When Ashtavakra entered the court, he saw that his father’s defeat was imminent. When the pundits saw the boy, they burst into laughter. Ashtavakra also started laughing. Janaka asked him, ‘Everyone else is laughing at you but why are you laughing?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Ashtavakra responded, ‘I am laughing because the truth is being explored by mere leather mongers in this conference. What are all these skinners doing here?’</em></p>
		<p><em>A deep silence prevailed at that. And Janaka said, ‘What do you mean?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘It is simple and straight forward. They see only the skin, they don’t see me. They see only the bent and deformed body. They are leather mongers who judge a person only by the looks. In the curve of the temple, is the sky curved? When a pot is smashed, is the sky smashed? The sky is beyond change. My body is twisted, but I am not’.</em></p>
		<p><em>At that Janaka faced the truth and felt repentant that he too laughed. Next day he sought out Astavakra and welcomed him into his palace. He placed all his questions before him and got answers. The result was a magnificent scripture called ‘Ashtavakra Samhita’.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, we shouldn’t jump to judge or criticise people in haste. I have another more contemporary story’. Ashish took out his story.</p>
		<p><em>Deepa went to school in the neighbouring village where she wasn’t known well.</em></p>
		<p><em>For three weeks, she came late to school and every time the teacher punished her.</em></p>
		<p><em>On the fourth week, Deepa didn’t attend school at all and many thought she had GIVEN UP on school due to the everyday punishment.</em></p>
		<p><em>However, Deepa reported again on fifth week and this time she came earlier than everybody.</em></p>
		<p><em>When the teacher came to class, Deepa was punished for not attending school the previous week but the teacher was also kind enough to commend her for coming early that day, stating that the punishments had finally yielded some results.</em></p>
		<p><em>Just then, Deepa asked if she could say something and the teacher gave her permission.</em></p>
		<p><em>She started:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I’ve been raised up by a single mother without a brother or a sister. Five weeks ago, my mother fell ill and was hospitalized. The three weeks I came late, I had to prepare something for her every morning and pass by the hospital to deliver the same. Unfortunately, my mother passed away last week and that’s the reason I didn’t come to school. We buried her last Friday. Today I came early since I didn’t have to prepare anything or even pass by the hospital. And now that she is gone, I will always be here early’’.</em></p>
		<p><em>As she sat down, no one in the whole class was able to hold their tears, the teacher was not spared either.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali then wanted to read an episode from the life of Ishwarachandra Vidyasagar. She started with a comment ‘Sometimes we judge people in haste by just looking at their dress and looks’.</p>
		<p><em>Ishwarachandra was born in 1820 to orthodox Brahmin parents. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics and even as a teenage boy he gained the respect of the entire village as a boy with a vast ocean of knowledge. Hence, he was conferred the title of Vidyasagar (Vidya –meaning learning, Sagar – meaning Ocean). He graduated with Sanskrit as his major and went on to become a very learned Sanskrit Pundit. He worked as a Sanskrit professor in Sanskrit College, Calcutta until his retirement. Simultaneously, he also was an entrepreneur, philanthropist, social activist, reformer, writer, publisher and also a renowned Bengali and Sanskrit linguist. Despite being highly successful and recognized in all these various fields, Vidyasagar remained an extremely modest man. Because of his humility, he was widely respected across the country.</em></p>
		<p><em>There was another certain pundit from across the country who had also studied Sanskrit grammar in great detail. However, despite all his struggles, he was unable to decipher certain portions of the Panini Sutras. He thought of the great Sanskrit pundit, Ishwarachandra and requested him for a brief discussion. Ishwarachandra agreed readily and invited him to come to Calcutta. He also volunteered to receive the pundit at the railway station and take him to his house. </em></p>
		<p><em>On the appointed day, Ishwarachandra was waiting at the railway station to receive this pundit. The pundit looked around searching for a well-dressed Ishwarachandra. He assumed that a person as respected and as famous as Ishwarachandra would wear shiny clothes and costly shoes. He could not find anyone dressed as exquisitely as he himself was and so beckoned the coolie who was walking towards him and ordered him to carry his luggage to Pundit Ishwarachandra’s home.</em></p>
		<p><em>Ishwarachandra quietly obeyed the pundit and carried his luggage to his own house. On the way, this pundit would not stop blowing his own trumpet. Ishwara listened to the pundit’s continuous self-praise but did not become angry or agitated. He still did not reveal his true identity, but quietly carried the luggage to his house.</em></p>
		<p><em>Upon reaching his house, he opened the door and invited the pundit inside courteously. It was then that the pundit realized who the ‘coolie’ was. He felt very ashamed of himself when he saw how such a genius like Ishwarachandra could dress so simply, conduct himself so modestly and respect everyone else so humbly, even when we were being treated like a coolie. He was astounded also by the simplicity of his residence and the simplicity of his habits. After staying with Ishwarachandra for a couple of days and after clarifying his grammar doubts, the pundit returned home, changing into a humbler man himself.</em></p>
		<p>‘Many a time we judge others for things we are not aware of about them. When we come to know the facts, we regret our hasty judgement..’. Anjali said softly and concluded the story.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes we may not agree with our parents. Sometimes we may not appreciate what they do, the way they lead their lives. And we tend to be judgemental about them but we should try to understand them. Here is one such story’. Swapna looked very mature when she spoke before she read her story. ‘This is rather longish but I think it is worth a read’.</p>
		<p>‘<em>At the point of his death, a man, Tom Smith, called his children and advised them to follow his footsteps so that they can have peace of mind in all that they do.</em></p>
		<p><em>His daughter, Sara, said,</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Daddy, it’s unfortunate you are dying without a penny in your bank. Other fathers that you tag as being corrupt, thieves of public funds left houses and properties for their children; even this house we live in is a rented apartment. Sorry, I can’t emulate you, just go, let’s chart our own course’.</em></p>
		<p><em>A few moments later, their father died.</em></p>
		<p><em>Three years later, Sara went for an interview in a multinational company. At the interview the Chairman of the committee asked, ‘Which Smith are you?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Sara replied,</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I am Sara Smith. My dad Tom Smith is no more’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Chairman cuts in, ‘O my God, you are Tom Smith’s daughter?’</em></p>
		<p><em>He turned to the other members and said, ‘This Smith man was the one that signed my membership form into the Institute of Administrators and his recommendation earned me where I am today. He did all these free. I didn’t even know his address, he never knew me. He just did it for me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>He turned to Sara,</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I have no questions for you, consider yourself as having gotten this job, come tomorrow, your letter will be waiting for you’.</em> <em>Sara Smith became the Corporate Affairs Manager of the company with two cars with drivers, A duplex attached to the office and a salary of £100,000 a year excluding allowances and other costs</em></p>
		<p><em>After two years of working in the company, the MD of the company came from America to announce his intention to resign and needed a replacement. A personality with high integrity was sought after, again the company’s Consultant nominated Sara Smith.</em></p>
		<p><em>In an interview, she was asked the secret of her success.</em></p>
		<p><em>With tears, she replied, ‘My dad paved these ways for me. It was after he died that I knew that he was financially poor but very rich in integrity, discipline and honesty’.</em></p>
		<p><em>She was asked again, why she was weeping since she was no longer a kid as to miss her dad still after a long time.</em></p>
		<p><em>She replied, ‘At the point of death, I insulted my dad for being an honest man of integrity. I hope he will forgive me in his grave now. I didn’t work for all these, he did it for me to just walk in’.</em></p>
		<p><em>So, finally she was asked, ‘Will you follow your father’s footsteps as he asked you to?’</em></p>
		<p><em>And her simple answer was, ‘I now adore the man, I have a big picture of him in my living room and at the entrance of my house. He deserves whatever I have after God’.</em></p>
		<p>‘I have a story very similar to this. But I would like to read it out only to emphasise what we learnt from Sarah’s change of attitude towards her father’. Anjali said and read out her story. <em></em></p>
		<p><em>The son didn’t like living in his house.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘You are leaving the room without switching off the fan’ ‘The TV is on in the room where there is no one. Switch it off!’ ‘Keep the pen in the stand; it is fallen down’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The son didn’t like his father nagging him for these minor things. He had to tolerate these things till yesterday since he was with them in the same house.</em></p>
		<p><em>But today, however, he has an invitation for a job interview. ‘As soon as I get the job, I should leave this town. There won’t be any nagging from my father’ were his thoughts.</em></p>
		<p><em>He left for the interview.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Answer the questions put to you without any hesitation. Even if you don’t know the answer, mention that confidently’. Father advised him on many things and also gave him more money than he actually needed to attend the interview.</em></p>
		<p><em>The son reached the interview centre.</em></p>
		<p><em>There was no security outside near the gate. Even though the door was open, the latch was protruding out probably hitting the people entering through the door. He put the latch properly, closed the door and entered the office.</em></p>
		<p><em>On both sides of the pathway he could see beautiful flower plants. The gardener had kept the water running in the hose-pipe and was not to be seen anywhere. The water was overflowing on the pathway. He kept the hosepipe near the plant and went further.</em></p>
		<p><em>There was no one in the reception area. However, there was a notice saying that the interview was in the first floor. He slowly climbed the stairs.</em></p>
		<p><em>The light that was switched on last night was still burning at 10 am in the morning. He remembered his father’s admonition, ‘Why are you leaving the room without switching off the light?’ and thought he could still hear that now. Even though he felt irritated by that thought, he sought the switch and switched off the light.</em></p>
		<p><em>Upstairs in a large hall he could see many aspirants sitting waiting for their turn. He looked at the number of people and wondered if he had any chance of getting the job.</em></p>
		<p><em>He entered the hall with some trepidation and stepped on the ‘Welcome’ mat placed near the door. He noticed that the mat was upside down. He straightened out the mat with some irritation. Habits die hard.</em></p>
		<p><em>He saw that in a few rows in the front there were many people waiting for their turn, whereas the back rows were empty, but a number of fans were running over those rows of seats.</em></p>
		<p><em>He heard his father’s voice again, ‘Why are the fans running in the room where there is no one?’ He switched off the fans that were not needed and sat in one of the empty chairs.</em></p>
		<p><em>He could see many men entering the interview room and immediately leave from another door. There was thus no way anyone could guess what was being asked in the interview.</em></p>
		<p><em>He went and stood before the interviewer with some trepidation and concern.</em></p>
		<p><em>The officer took the certificates from him and without looking at them asked, ‘When can you join work?’</em></p>
		<p><em>He thought, ‘Is this a trick question being asked in the interview, or is this a signal that I have been offered the job?’ He was confused.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘What are you thinking?’ asked the boss. ‘We didn’t ask anyone any question here. By asking a few questions we won’t be able to assess the skills of anyone. So, our test was to assess the attitude of the person. We kept certain tests based on the behaviour of the candidates and we observed everyone through CCTV. No one who came in today did anything to set right the hose pipe, the welcome mat, the uselessly running fans or lights. You were the only one who did that. That’s why we have decided to select you for the job’, said the boss.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali concluded her story and everyone clapped.</p>
		<p>‘I think one of the most fundamental relationships we enjoy is with the family members. Parents have a role in shaping the lives of the children. Apart from family the people we value most are friends. Sometimes misunderstanding between friends may lead to very serious consequences. Sometime ago I read in the newspapers that a girl took her life because the group of friends she always was with in college stopped talking to her for some reason. Do you have any stories on friendship? Nandita asked.</p>
		<p>‘I have something which will tell us how to preserve the relationship between friends’. Tejas took the story out and read it.</p>
		<p><em>One day a person met the great Chanakya and asked, ‘Do you know what I just heard about your friend?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Hold on a minute’, Chanakya said.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Before telling me anything I’d like you to pass a little test. It’s called the Triple Filter Test’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Triple filter test?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘That’s right’. Chanakya continued.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you’re going to say. That’s why I call it the triple filter test’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The first filter is Truth.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No’. The man said. ‘Actually, I just heard about it and..’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘All right,’ said Chanakya. ‘So, you don’t know if it’s true or not. Now let’s try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Are you about to tell me about my friend something good?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No, on the contrary..’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘So,’ Chanakya continued, ‘you want to tell me something bad about him, but you’re not certain it’s true. You may still pass the test though, because there’s one filter left, the filter of Usefulness.</em></p>
		<p><em>Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No, not really’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Well,’ concluded Chanakya, ‘if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell me at all?’</em></p>
		<p>‘It is something all of us need to remember’. Hemant commented. He then added,</p>
		<p>‘It is very important how we relate with others. This includes how we talk about them and report about them. We need to be fair to people around us. This story almost illustrates what Chanakya said about how careful we should be while talking about others’.</p>
		<p><em>Once an old man spread rumours that his neighbour was a thief. As a result, the young man was arrested. </em></p>
		<p><em>Days later the young man was proven innocent. After being released he sued the old man for wrongly accusing him.</em></p>
		<p><em>In the court the old man told the Judge: ‘They were just comments, didn’t harm anyone’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The judge told the old man: ‘Write all the things you said about him on a piece of paper. Tear it up on the way home and throw away the pieces. Tomorrow, come back to hear the sentence’. </em></p>
		<p><em>Next day, the judge told the old man: ‘Before receiving the sentence, you will have to go out and gather all the pieces of paper that you threw out yesterday’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The old man said: ‘I can’t do that! The wind spread them and I won’t know where to find them’. </em></p>
		<p><em>The judge then replied: ‘The same way, simple comments may destroy the honour of a man to such an extent that one is not able to fix it. If you can’t speak well of someone, rather don’t say anything’.</em></p>
		<p>‘This story is about the respect we should give to people around us. Here is a real-life account. A friend sent it to me some time ago’. Ashish read the story he brought.</p>
		<p><em>This is about Mr. Zavere Poonawala (Brother of Dr. Cyrus Poonawala) who is a well-known industrialist in Pune. He had this driver named Ganga Datt with him for the last 30 years on his limousine, which was originally owned by Acharya Rajneesh.</em></p>
		<p><em>Ganga Datt passed away recently and at that time Mr. Poonawala was in Mumbai for some important work. As soon as he heard the news, he cancelled all his meetings, requested the driver’s family to await him for the cremation and came back to Pune immediately by a helicopter.</em></p>
		<p><em>On reaching Pune, he asked the limo to be decorated with flowers as he wished Ganga Datt should be taken in the same car which he himself had driven since the beginning. When Ganga Datt’s family agreed to his wishes, he himself drove Ganga Datt from his home up to the cremation ghat on his last journey.</em></p>
		<p><em>When asked about it, Mr. Poonawala replied that Ganga Datt had served him day and night, and he could at least do this being eternally grateful to him. He further added that Ganga Datt rose up from poverty and educated both his children very well. His daughter is a Chartered accountant and that is so commendable.</em></p>
		<p><em>His comment in the end is the essence of a successful life in all aspects:</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Everybody earns money. There is nothing unusual in that, but we should always be grateful to those people who contribute to our success. This is the belief we have been brought up with, which made me do what I did’.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali said, ‘I have two stories which I will read one after the other. I don’t know who has authored them’. She first read out one brief story.</p>
		<p><em>During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one: ‘What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?’ Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?</em></p>
		<p><em>I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade. ‘Absolutely,’ said the professor. ‘In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say ‘hello’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I’ve never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy’.</em></p>
		<p>The second story:</p>
		<p><em>This story is about a person working with a freezer plant. It was almost the end of the day. Everyone had packed up to check out.</em></p>
		<p><em>A technical snag developed in the plant and he went to check. By the time he finished it was late. The doors were sealed and the lights were off.</em></p>
		<p><em>Trapped inside the ice plant for the night without air and light, an icy grave was almost sure for him.</em></p>
		<p><em>Hours passed thus. Suddenly he found someone opening the door. Was it a miracle?</em></p>
		<p><em>The security guard entered there with a torch and helped him to come out.</em></p>
		<p><em>On the way back the person asked the security guard, ‘How did you know that I was inside? Who informed you?’ the guard said, ‘No one sir; this unit has about 50 people. But you are the only one who says Hello to me in the morning and Bye in the evening.</em></p>
		<p><em>You had reported in the morning but did not go out. That made me suspicious’</em></p>
		<p><em>He never knew a small gesture of greeting someone would prove to be a lifesaver for him.</em></p>
		<p>‘Both the stories tell us how important it is to have human relationship not only with family members and friends but also with people in our work front’. Ashish commented.</p>
		<p>‘Education is not a degree or certificate that can be shown to others as proof. It is our attitude, actions, language and behaviour with others in real life!’ Hemant said gravely. </p>
		<p>‘In fact, education should make us understand others and respect them whatever position they are in. We learnt a lot from the essay <em>On Saying Please</em> by A G Gardiner. I will give you a real incident my teacher told me once. I will put it in first person’ Anjali started her narration.</p>
		<p><em>As I entered the office I heard Gita shouting at Ramulu,‘Why don’t you do the work properly? It’s one week since my office has been swept. Don’t you get your salary regularly? Then why don’t you do your work also regularly?’ Ramulu was literally being battered by her words.</em></p>
		<p><em>My office was in wing B. I had to walk down the corridor of wing A and then turn left to reach my room. When I was opening the lock, I found Bhiku waiting quietly with his broom. I smiled to see him thus. There are fourteen rooms for the faculty. While Ramulu took care of seven rooms Bhiku did the other seven. They took turns between the two wings. So, all of us knew both of them. Bhiku was dark, lean and had a big moustache. He hardly spoke to anybody. They said he resented his ‘lowly’ job of a sweeper and never wanted his sons to take up the job of a ‘lowly sweeper’. At home he never took the broom into his hands but at office he had to. No one took any notice of him. His existence as a human being could be ignored as long as the rooms were kept clean. Gita always complained against Bhiku. One day when she shouted at him for not cleaning her room Bhiku answered back ‘But you always come late… after I finish my work…’ Gita was furious and sought his transfer to the other wing. That’s how he started doing my room these days. ‘Now Gita seems to have problem with Ramulu too…she should not shout at him…’I was lost in my thoughts. Suddenly I realised that Bhiku slowed down his work. He was still at the door though really, he had finished sweeping. Something flashed in my mind. ‘Thank you Bhiku’ I said with a smile. I saw a glint in his eyes as he walked away. I have understood why Bhiku willingly worked for me, even waited at the door if I was a little late…for those two magic words of ‘thank you!’</em></p>
		<p>‘So, it is not only important to know the first names of the people working with us at different levels but also to be polite to them’. Ashish observed.</p>
		<p>The following Sunday when Nandita settled down with the group she said. ‘We have looked at the family relationships, friendship and also people in our life as professionals. Another quality we should develop is compassion for others. Compassion is a necessary emotion if we want to improve our interpersonal relation in life, be it in family, society or in the work front. Here is a story that gives us a message to make us understand that’.</p>
		<p><em>One young academically excellent person went to apply for a managerial position in a big company.</em></p>
		<p><em>He passed the first interview; the director did the last interview, made the last decision.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director discovered from the CV that the youth’s academic achievements were excellent all the way, from the secondary school until the postgraduate research, never had there been a year when he did not score well.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director asked, ‘Did you obtain any scholarships in school?’ the youth answered ‘none’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director asked, ‘Was it your father who paid for your school fees?’ The youth answered, ‘My father passed away when I was one year old, it was my mother who paid for my school fees’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director asked, ‘Where did your mother work?’ The youth answered, ‘My mother worked as washer’. The director requested the youth to show his hands. The youth showed a pair of hands that were smooth and perfect.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director asked, ‘Have you ever helped your mother wash the clothes before?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth answered, ‘Never, my mother always wanted me to study and read more books. Furthermore, my mother can wash clothes faster than me’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director said, ‘I have a request. When you go back today, go and clean your mother’s hands and then see me tomorrow morning’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth felt that his chance of landing the job was high. When he went back, he happily requested his mother to let him clean her hands. His mother felt strange, happy but with mixed feelings, she showed her hands to the kid.</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth cleaned his mother’s hands slowly. His tears fell as he did that. It was the first time he noticed that his mother’s hands were so wrinkled and there were so many bruises in her hands. Some bruises were so painful that his mother shivered when they were cleaned with water.</em></p>
		<p><em>This was the first time the youth realized that it was this pair of hands that washed the clothes everyday to enable him to pay the school fee. The bruises in the mother’s hands were the price that the mother had to pay for his graduation, academic excellence and his future.</em></p>
		<p><em>After finishing the cleaning of his mother hands, the youth quietly washed all the remaining clothes for his mother. That night, mother and son talked for a very long time. Next morning, the youth went to the director’s office.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Director noticed the tears in the youth’s eyes and asked: ‘Can you tell me what you have done and learned yesterday in your house?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth answered, ‘I cleaned my mother’s hand and also finished cleaning all the remaining clothes’</em></p>
		<p><em>The Director asked, ‘Please tell me your feelings’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The youth said, ‘Number 1, I know now what appreciation is. Without my mother, there would not be the ‘successful me’ today. Number 2, by working together and helping my mother, only now I realize how difficult and tough it is to get something done. Number 3, I have come to realise how to appreciate the importance and value of family relationship’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The director said, ‘This is what I am looking for in the manager I would like to recruit.</em></p>
		<p><em>I want to recruit a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others to get things done and a person who would not put money as his only goal in life. You are hired’.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, a lot of connectivity is there between our private life and public life. I think ultimately our attitudes are shaped by the way we relate with people around us even in a close circle. And it affects our career’. Hemant looked thoughtful as he spoke.</p>
		<p>‘Yes. How we relate with others in personal life certainly has a bearing on how we can relate with people in the work front as well’. Nandita commented. </p>
		<p>‘What we have learnt is that we should value those who work with us and their contribution, however junior they are. Interpersonal relation improves if, first of all, we understand the value of the other person. Here is another story on how to value others’. With these comments it was Amina who read her story first when they met on Saturday.</p>
		<p><em>A long time ago, in Egypt lived a famous mystic Zun-Nun. A young man came to visit him and asked ‘Master, I do not understand why people like you dress in such a simple way. Isn’t it necessary to dress well, not only for the performance but also for other reasons?</em></p>
		<p><em>The mystic only smiled and took his ring from one of his fingers, and said ‘Young friend, I will answer your question, but first do one thing for me, take this ring and go to the market across this street, can you sell this for one chip of gold?’ Having looked at Zun-Nun’s dull ring, the young man became doubtful. ‘One chip of gold, I am not sure this ring could be sold at that price’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Try first, young man, who knows you may do it’. The Young man went to the market quickly. He offered the ring to the textile, vegetable, meat, fish traders, and others. The fact was that nobody was willing to pay for a chip of Gold. He went back to Zun-Nun’s residence and reported ‘Master, nobody was ready to offer more than one chip of silver’</em></p>
		<p><em>With a wise smile Zun-Nun said, ‘Now go to the Gold Shop at the back of this street. Show this to the owner or to the gold trader. Don’t give your price; just find out how much he will pay for this ring’</em></p>
		<p><em>The Young man went to the shop mentioned and returned with a different expression on his face. He then reported ‘Master, the traders in the market really do not know the value of this ring, the gold trader offered this ring for one thousand gold coins and the value of this ring was one thousand times more than what the traders in the market offered’</em></p>
		<p><em>Zun-Nun just smiled subtly and spoke softly, ‘that was the answer to your question my friend, ‘Someone cannot be valued only from his dress. ‘The traders in the market’ gave value according to their limited knowledge. But not the gold traders.</em></p>
		<p><em>The gold and diamond inside someone could only be seen and valued if you can look at the inner soul. It needs a heart to see and it needs a process. We cannot see it from the words or attitude that is seen only for a while. Many a time what we think as gold may only be brass but that brass may as well be gold.</em></p>
		<p>‘But we are always told about the dress code and how to dress in a formal situation..’. grumbled Hemant. Nandita smiled and said, ‘Yes, of course. What the mystic said is only about simplicity of dress. He was not referring to unkempt dress. He used his dress not to impress others but to feel comfortable and also make others feel comfortable looking at him’.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes building positive relationship over a period of time gives confidence and zeal to live. I have a story by Fan Dai which I read on the net sometime ago’. Amina read out her story.</p>
		<p><em>Yingping has had two lives. The dividing line came with the explosion in the firecracker factory when she was 17. She undid her first life and started the second one from ‘ rock bottom’, re-emerging from seven operations. Wearing a face patched up by skin from her thighs, a face that resembled a map of random territories. </em></p>
		<p><em>The face was rugged. Yingping tried smiling. The patches twisted each other and negotiated a smile that was hardly detectable. She got married: she, an educated woman who lived in a prosperous city, he an illiterate retired soldier, desperate to escape a life back in his village with no electricity. It was a good match. She was his dignity, decoding the mystery of words and people for him. He was her self-esteem, shielding her from inquisitive stares, armed with shopping lists that had drawings representing daily items. They were inseparable, except that they never went out together.</em></p>
		<p><em>Yingping has now arrived at a ripe old age. Her face has smoothened out as the result of the negotiation between the patches of the skin. Somehow, the skin has lost the ability to wrinkle, giving her a permanently youngish face. She has learned to smile better lately. Her husband has started walking with her in the street for some time now. Lately, he has learned to walk with her in the street, holding her hand. The couple has fallen in love with each other. </em></p>
		<p>Tejas looked a little dull that day. When others prodded him, he opened up. ‘You know, I was watching the news on the television last night. There was a huge fire in the pub in Mumbai and so many young people were suffocated to death’.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, I was horrified to read that some girls hid in the washroom to escape the fire. I don’t understand. It was not a terror attack but fire. They should have taken the stairs’. </p>
		<p>‘I think many of us do not know what to do in case of various disasters. We should look up the internet and put up on the notice board the various measures we should take during different kinds of disasters’. Raju suggested. </p>
		<p>Nandita, when she heard about their plan, said, ‘It is very important to know what to do when there is disaster. Many of us don’t even know how to use a fire extinguisher. The episode of the Air Hostess Neerja’s cool behaviour when the airplane was hijacked is an excellent example of disaster management. Our next topic is disaster management’.</p>
