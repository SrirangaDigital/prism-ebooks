		<p>‘The United Nations defines a disaster as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society. Disasters involve widespread human, material, economic or environmental impacts, which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope with using its own resources’.</p>
		<p>‘We could include personal disasters in this’. Nandita said. ‘I have a story for you’. She then read out the story.</p>
		<p><em> The nurse on duty took the anxious young Army Major to the bedside.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Your son is here,’ she said softly, to the old man lying there on the bed.</em></p>
		<p><em>She had to repeat the words several times before the patient’s eyes opened.</em></p>
		<p><em>Heavily sedated because of the pain of his heart attack, he dimly saw the young and uniformed Major standing outside the oxygen tent.</em></p>
		<p><em>He reached out his hand.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Major wrapped his toughened fingers around the old man’s limp ones, squeezing a message of love and encouragement.</em></p>
		<p><em>The nurse, observing the touching moments, brought a chair so that the Major could sit beside the bed.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Thank you, Ma’am!’ a polite acknowledgement followed.</em></p>
		<p><em>All through the night, the young Major sat there in the poorly lit ward, holding the old man’s hand and offering him words of love and strength. Occasionally, the nurse suggested that the officer to move away and rest awhile.</em></p>
		<p><em>He graciously refused.</em></p>
		<p><em>Whenever the nurse came into the ward, she found him oblivious of her and of the night noises of the hospital - the clanking of the oxygen tank, the laughter of the night staff members exchanging greetings, the cries and moans of the other patients.</em></p>
		<p><em>Now and then she heard him say a few gentle words. The dying man said nothing, only held his hands tightly all through the night.</em></p>
		<p><em>Towards dawn, the old man died. The Major released the now lifeless hand he had been holding and went to tell the nurse.</em></p>
		<p><em>While she did what she had to do, he waited...</em></p>
		<p><em>Finally, she returned and started to offer words of sympathy, but the Major interrupted her</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Who was that man?’ he asked.</em></p>
		<p><em>The nurse was startled, ‘He was your father,’ she answered.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘No, he wasn’t,’ the Major replied. ‘I never saw him before in my life’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Then why didn’t you say something when I took you to him?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I knew right away there had been a mistake, but I also knew he needed his son and his son just wasn’t here!’</em></p>
		<p><em>The nurse listened on, confused.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘When I realized that he was too sick to tell whether or not I was his son, knowing how much he needed me, I stayed’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘So, then what was the purpose of your visit here, at the hospital, Sir?’ the nurse asked.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I came here tonight to find a Mr. Vikram Salaria. His son was killed in Jammu and Kashmir last night and I was sent to inform him’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘But the man whose hand you kept holding whole night was Mr. Vikram Salaria!’</em></p>
		<p><em>They stood in complete silence. There couldn’t be anything more assuring for a dying man than his son’s hand!</em></p>
		<p><em>The next time someone needs you ... just be there! Just stay!!!</em></p>
		<p>‘How nice of the Major to have offered solace to the old man’ Anjali was full of admiration for the army officer.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, sometimes we need to be discrete about certain details in order to help others emotionally during the time of their personal disaster’. Nandita commented.</p>
		<p>‘When Nature plays havoc like storm, earth quake or tsunami, we should be able to keep calm and do our best to help others, am I right?’, Ashish asked.</p>
		<p>‘Yes indeed, though it is a bit difficult’. Nandita agreed. ‘Try and get some real-life stories’, she said before she left.</p>
		<p>The entire group was excited as this time they had to specifically look for stories of heroes.</p>
		<p>‘I have a real-life episode from Thomas Edison’s life’ Raju said and read out the piece.</p>
		<p><em>At around 5:30 in the evening on December 10, 1914, a massive explosion erupted in West Orange, New Jersey. Ten buildings in legendary inventor Thomas Edison’s plant, which comprised more than half of the site, were engulfed in flames. Between six and eight fire departments rushed to the scene, but the chemical-fuelled inferno was too powerful to put out the flames quickly.</em></p>
		<p><em>According to a 1961 Reader’s Digest article by Edison’s son Charles, Edison calmly walked over to him as he watched the fire destroy his dad’s work. In a childlike voice, Edison told his 24-year-old son, ‘Go get your mother and all her friends. They will never see a fire like this again’. When Charles objected, Edison said, ‘It’s all right. We’ve just got rid of a lot of rubbish’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Later, at the scene of the blaze, Edison said, ‘Although I am over 67 years old, I’ll start all over again tomorrow’. He stuck to his word and immediately began rebuilding the next morning, without firing any of his employees.</em></p>
		<p><em>Edison could have wept, yelled in anger, or locked himself in his house in a state of depression. But instead, he put on a smile and told his son to enjoy the spectacle.</em></p>
		<p><em>Edison lost $US919,788 (about $US23 million in today’s dollars). The flames had consumed years of priceless records and prototypes and his plant’s insurance only covered about a third of the total damage.</em></p>
		<p><em>But after just three weeks, with a sizeable loan from his friend Henry Ford, Edison got part of the plant up and running again. His employees worked double shifts and set to work producing more than ever. Edison and his team went on to make almost $US10 million in revenue the following year.</em></p>
		<p>Edison’s story is a powerful example of someone who ‘transforms fear into prudence, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking’. Raju concluded with the quote.</p>
		<p>‘I think when disaster strikes the attitude towards it matters a lot. If we accept that it has happened and that we cannot change the past can help us a lot. Finding the opportunity to overcome a challenge ultimately makes us stronger’, Swapna commented.</p>
		<p>‘I have a real-life story of a young man during the super cyclone in Cuttack in the year 1999. I found this among the old newspaper clippings of The Indian Express newspaper my mother kept’. Everyone became curious as Ashish narrated the story.</p>
		<p><em>Partho was a school dropout who migrated to Cuttack looking for a job. He found a place with an old couple whose children were living away in Delhi. The old man was bedridden. Partho literally took charge of the house fetching grocery and spending a lot of time cooking meals for the old couple. It was just two months after he arrived in the house that the cyclone hit the city. Houses had collapsed, roads blocked with fallen trees, carcasses were floating in the over flowing drains, there were mass funerals. All telephone lines remained snapped for days on end. There was no electricity and there was acute food shortage. Throughout the difficult times he was beside the sick couple. His own village was marooned and he had no news of his parents who he left behind. Rains must have washed away the little hut where his parents lived. He did not know whether they were alive. It was only after the semblance of order was restored and help arrived for the old frightened couple did Partho leave for his village. </em></p>
		<p>‘Well, cyclones have their own way of humbling people. What is important is to keep one’s cool. There must be scores of Parthos around in times of disaster. Otherwise meeting disasters by old and weak is difficult’ commented Hemant.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, sometimes you will have to risk your own life to save a large number of people. I remember the story of a little boy which I read when I was in school. Shall I tell you about this boy?’ Hemant asked. Everyone nodded asking him to go ahead.</p>
		<p><em>Hans was a poor boy who lived with his parents in a small village in Holland. The part in which Hans lived was below sea level and so a strong and wide dyke had been erected to save the village and town from the sea.</em></p>
		<p><em>Hans was a worthy son and did all he could to help at home. After helping his mother, he would go off to his school with his school bag. The school was about three miles away from his house.</em></p>
		<p><em>Hans had to pass by the dyke, to reach his school. He loved walking to school looking at all the interesting things on his way. Thus, he had learnt a lot about different kinds of trees and flowers and birds and animals. But sometimes this caused him delay in reaching his school in time.</em></p>
		<p><em>One morning when Hans was on his way to school, he saw a beautiful bird and was charmed by the colours of its feathers. He quietly followed the beautiful bird and forgot the time. He had forgotten that he had to go to school too. Then, he suddenly heard the school bell. He knew that he was late.</em></p>
		<p><em>He ran as fast as he could only to see the doors were already shut. There was nothing he could do now. He had to stay outside and wait. After about an hour the school gate opened and his teacher let him in.</em></p>
		<p><em>Hans apologized and explained why he was late. The teacher did not scold him for his love for the beauty of Nature. However, he was asked to stay in school for an hour after the lessons.</em></p>
		<p><em>After the school was over all the boys ran out into the playground but Hans had to stay in the classroom in order to compensate the one-hour delay in the morning. His teacher gave him a new lesson to learn.</em></p>
		<p><em>At the end of the hour, the teacher called him and asked questions related to the lesson. Hans answered them correctly and was allowed to go home. Hans ran out straight into the playground, but he did not find any of his school friends there. They had all gone home. Hans had to walk home alone.</em></p>
		<p><em>He crossed the cornfields and now he was walking along the sea-wall. It was almost evening. The sun was making its way to the horizon.</em></p>
		<p><em>Suddenly Hans heard a sound of trickle of water nearby. He became alert as anyone in Holland would. People in Holland were always cautious about any possible seepage in the dyke. Hans moved towards the sound and found a thin trickle of water through a small hole.</em></p>
		<p><em>He knew the tremendous pressure of sea water would make the hole bigger in no time. He didn’t know what to do. He hoped someone would pass by and he could send the message to his village people. One hour passed and no one turned up.</em></p>
		<p><em>In the meantime, the hole had become bigger and the sea water was gushing out. Hans covered the hole with his back, to stop the flow of water, but in vain. It didn’t help.</em></p>
		<p><em>Then, he inserted his hand into the hole to plug it. It had already become dark. It was cold. He was feeling a little frightened also, but his sense of duty compelled him to stay there all alone.</em></p>
		<p><em>The entire night passed and Hans could not get anyone to help him. But his firm determination to save his village and the town from a certain disaster kept him in his place undeterred. By morning his body had become stiff with cold and he had fainted.</em></p>
		<p><em>In the early hours of morning a workman was walking along the sea-wall on his way to the town. He stopped to see a boy lying unconscious by the dyke he went near him out of curiosity.</em></p>
		<p><em>The workman took a closer look. He saw his right hand inserted into a hole in the dyke and he also noticed a thin trickle of water despite his hand plugging the hole. It took him no time to understand the grave situation.</em></p>
		<p><em>First the workman checked the pulse and heartbeat of Hans. Hans was alive. Now the workman had two great responsibilities. He had to save him and also plug the hole. First, he filled the hole with stones and earth. And then he carried Hans in his arms and took him home.</em></p>
		<p><em>For many weeks Hans lay in his bed. </em></p>
		<p><em>The people of the village came to see him. They brought wonderful presents for him and spoke kindly to him. The most important man of the village came and said to Hans, ‘Hans, we cannot thank you enough. You risked your life to save our village from the sea, and that too at such a tender age. We shall never forget this kind act of yours. Your name will appear in golden letters in the history of Holland’.</em></p>
		<p>‘The boy risked his life to save the village from disaster. Very brave indeed’ commented Anjali.</p>
		<p>‘It’s lucky he was saved’ Amina said with relief in her tone.</p>
		<p>‘Yes indeed. It is good when the heroes come out of danger after the disaster. War is one such disaster. But it inevitably hurts and kills. Behind every hero there is a human and there is a pain he suffers. But how the suffering is encountered with determination and how he moves on in life is what is great. I read an account of Duozolie Angami, a 20-year-old Naga Regiment soldier in Kargil war. I will give you a gist of the account by Anuradha Nagaraj in The Indian Express of 25 November 1999. I have got the newspaper clipping but will give you the gist’. She started the narration.</p>
		<p><em>It was Kargil war. We had lost soldiers and some were badly injured. Duozolie Angami fought bravely but both his hands had been blown apart. The hands that had once fired a self-loading rifle had been reduced to bandaged stumps and he was lying on the hospital bed in Delhi. If his nose itched, he could not scratch it and had to ask his friend to scratch it. Down with serious splinter injuries and tied to hospital bed, he was letting out war cries to go back to the battlefield and finish the remaining enemies. The brave lad who fought the enemy became a homesick young man when he said he missed his parents. There was pain but one could not mistake the determination on his face. At 21, he left the army for his village in Nagaland to face a difficult future. This young man with a sunny personality and zest for life now symbolises resurgence. He has built a house in Dimapur. He has got a new pair of robotic hands. He can now pick up a spoon, write letters and scratch his nose. He can now hug his family. An assistant at ONGC in Nazira, Angami says, ‘You have to look ahead, not backward’.</em></p>
		<p>‘War is a man-made disaster. I wish we never have wars. But of course, when we face the disaster the best thing is to look ahead and not look back’. Swapna said pensively.</p>
