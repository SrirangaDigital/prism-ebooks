		<p>‘All of us keep thinking all the time. Thinking does not need much conscious effort on our part..’. Nandita began to address the group.</p>
		<p>‘In fact, to keep our mind free of thinking needs an effort. I tried in my Yoga and meditation class’. Ashish was quick to add.</p>
		<p>‘Indeed. If someone asks whether you prefer tea or coffee, you need not take a long time to think and answer. If an arithmetic problem is given, you think for a while and apply the formula which already has been given and answer it. Here, thinking has already been done by someone else and you are using the procedure to give your answer. But if a puzzle or a riddle is given, you take some time to think and give an answer. This involves ‘reasoning’. It requires you to think independently, or you work out a ‘procedure’ yourself’. Nandita paused and looked around before she continued.</p>
		<p>‘So, it is not just thinking but the different levels of thinking..’. Hemant said. </p>
		<p>‘Yes. This involves a skill. Let us call it ‘reasoning’. It is a procedure by which we draw a conclusion and reach a decision on the strength of the reasons. Reasoning is coupled with consideration of alternatives, deep thinking of the consequences and also weighing available evidences make up critical thinking. Critical thinking helps us understand others, others’ situation as well as ourselves. There are various ways in which we can do it’. Nandita said as she sat down with the group that Sunday. ‘We are going to discuss this aspect today’.</p>
		<p>‘We keep hearing this term quite often. Our teachers do help us analyse the topics critically to have a better understanding. We also have learnt about lateral thinking’. Hemant said.</p>
		<p>‘Yes. As we grow up we do learn to question many things around us. Of all the ‘<strong>wh</strong>’ questions ‘why’ is the question responsible for our growth. It shows inquisitiveness. So many people before Newton must have seen an apple falling from the tree. But Newton asked the question ‘why’ which led to the scientific discovery’. Nandita smiled as she explained. She continued. ‘Critical thinking about ourselves leads to introspection, reflection, so that our responses become more responsible’. Nandita paused and looked at the young faces. ‘I will give you a small example of how critical thinking helps in problem solving.</p>
		<p><em>A young man went for an interview. He was asked a question by the committee. The question was: You are driving along in your car on a wild, stormy night. You pass by a bus stop, and you see three people waiting for the bus; an old lady who looks as if she is about to die, an old friend who once saved your life, and the perfect woman you have been dreaming about. Which one would you choose to offer a ride to, knowing that there could only be one more passenger in your car?</em></p>
		<p><em>The young man was faced with a dilemma. He could take the old woman because he could save her from dying. Or he could take his friend who once helped him. He may never be able to find another woman so perfect a lover. The young man thought for a short while and came up with his answer which stunned the interviewer. He said, ‘I would give the car keys to my friend who helped me earlier and ask him to take the old lady to the hospital and I would stay behind with the woman of my dreams and take the bus’. The young man was hired.</em></p>
		<p>When they heard what the young man had answered the entire group clapped happily. ‘Brilliant!’</p>
		<p>‘Yes, this is how developing critical thinking helps us’ Nandita commented. ‘Now, find out stories that help critical thinking’. Nandita left the room wondering what stories they would bring, as she was interested in the topic herself.</p>
		<p>Raju found a story that illustrated critical thinking further.</p>
		<p><em>A boy went to a telephone booth which was at the cash counter of a store and dialled a number. The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation:</em></p>
		<p><em>Boy: ‘Madam, can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?’</em></p>
		<p><em>Woman: (at the other end of the phone line) ‘I already have someone to cut my lawn’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Boy: ‘Madam, I will cut your lawn for half the price than the person who cuts your lawn now’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Woman: ‘I’m very satisfied with the person who is presently cutting the lawn’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Boy: (with more perseverance) ‘Madam, I’ll even sweep the floor and the stairs of your house for free’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Woman: ‘No, thank you’.</em></p>
		<p><em>With a smile on his face, the little boy put the receiver down. The store-owner, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy.</em></p>
		<p><em>Store-owner: ‘Son…. I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a job’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Boy: ‘No thanks’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Store-owner: ‘But you were really pleading for one’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Boy: ‘No Sir, I was just checking my performance at the job I already have. I am the one who is working for that lady I was talking to!’</em></p>
		<p>‘I think the boy will go a long way in life and career. He not only seems to be a sincere worker who gives satisfaction to his employer but also wants to make sure that he has delivered work well’. Tejas said.</p>
		<p>‘This is called <em>Self-Appraisal</em>’, Raju said with a smile.</p>
		<p>‘You know, we have legendary characters in India who are very well known for their critical thinking. I know at least two names: Birbal and Tenali Rama. They are known for their wit and wisdom. I’ll give you one story of Birbal now’. Ashish told the group the story. </p>
		<p><em>Birbal was in the court of Emperor Akbar. The emperor was very fond of Birbal and whenever he encountered a problem he sought his help as he relied on Birbal’s wisdom. One day Emperor Akbar lost his ring. When Birbal arrived in the court Akbar said, ‘I have lost my ring. Please help me find the ring’. Birbal said, ‘Do not worry your Majesty, I’ll find out your ring. I think your Majesty’s ring is right here in the court with one of the courtiers. The courtier who has a piece of straw in his beard has the ring’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The courtier who stole the ring was shocked and immediately his hand went to his beard. Birbal pointed him out and said, ‘Please search the man. He has the ring’. The ring was recovered from the man.</em></p>
		<p><em>Akbar could not understand how Birbal could know who took the ring. Birbal told him, ‘Your Majesty, I know that a guilty man is always scared. That’s all’. </em></p>
		<p>‘Sometimes our own wisdom and logical thinking can save us from trouble. I have a story of Tenali Raman who was in the court of Vijayanagara king Sri Krishna Devaraya’ Anjali said and began her story.</p>
		<p><em>One day Krishnadevaraya dreamt of a magnificent palace made of dazzling stones floating in the air. It had all the facilities and lit up with a thousand lights dispelling darkness.</em></p>
		<p><em>The next day when the king woke up, he vividly remembered the dream. He summoned all his courtiers and told them about it. The courtiers sang praises of the king and his beautiful dream. The king made a public announcement: ‘I will give a hundred thousand gold coins to the person who can build me the palace of my dream’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Everyone was startled at the king’s announcement. They knew that it was not practically possible to build the palace that the king wanted. But no one had the courage to say so. Many of the king’s well-wishers told him that such a palace can only exist in one’s mind. But he refused to listen and threatened his courtiers with grave consequences if they did not find someone who could make his dream come true.</em></p>
		<p><em>The courtiers got worried and approached Tenali Raman for help.</em></p>
		<p><em>A few days later, a very old man came to meet the king in his court. He was crying for justice.</em></p>
		<p><em>Krishnadevaraya asked, ‘What brings you here my good man? Tell me without fear and I assure you that justice will be done’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘I have been robbed, Your Majesty,’ wailed the old man. ‘Someone has taken away all my savings and now I don’t have a single paisa left’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Who robbed you?’ asked the king angrily. ‘Such a crime cannot go unpunished. You name him and I will have him hanged immediately!’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Your Majesty! I will tell you but first assure me that on hearing upon his name, you will not get angry and punish me instead,’ requested the old man.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Yes, I promise,’ replied the king impatiently. ‘It is you, my lord,’ said the old man in a trembling voice.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘How dare you say a ridiculous thing like that, I will…,’ began the king, but then he remembered his promise and calmed down. He asked the old man to explain what he actually meant to say.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Your Majesty! Last night, I dreamt that you came with your entourage of ministers and soldiers and looted my entire life’s savings, five thousand gold coins!’ said the old man.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Are you a fool or completely insane?’ roared the king. ‘How can you treat your dream as a reality? Dreams are not true!’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘But they are, Your Majesty! If your dream of a palace hanging in air can come true, why can’t my dream come true?’ retorted the old man.</em></p>
		<p><em>And then, the man took off his beard, false hair and stood before the king. It was none other than Tenali Rama!</em></p>
		<p><em>He bowed before the king and said, ‘Your Majesty! This was the only way to convince you that building the palace of your dreams was not practically possible’.</em></p>
		<p>Everyone had a good laugh at Tenali Raman’s wit and ability to present facts convincingly.</p>
		<p>Amina took out her story with a remark. ‘I have a brief story about an ant. After I narrate it, I would like us to discuss the ant’s behaviour’. Then she read out from the piece of paper she brought. </p>
		<p><em>One Sunday morning, a wealthy man sat in his balcony enjoying sunshine and his coffee when a little ant caught his eye which was going from one side to the other side of the balcony carrying a big leaf several times bigger than its size. The Man watched it for more than an hour. He saw that the ant faced many impediments during its journey, paused, took a diversion and then continued towards its destination. At one point the tiny creature came across a crack in the floor.</em></p>
		<p><em>It paused for a little while, analyzed and then laid the huge leaf over the crack, walked over the leaf, picked the leaf on the other side then continued its journey.</em></p>
		<p><em>The man was captivated by the cleverness of the ant, one of God’s tiniest creatures. The incident left him in awe.</em></p>
		<p><em> But about an hour later he saw, the creature had reached its destination – a tiny hole in the floor which was entrance to its underground dwelling. So, the ant, after all the painstaking hard work and exercising great skills, overcoming all the difficulties along the way, just left behind the large leaf and went home empty-handed.</em></p>
		<p>‘This Tiny Creature of God, lacking in size yet equipped with a brain to analyze, contemplate, reason, explore, discover and overcome obstacle. But in the end, it could not take its food to its destination. Why?’ Amina asked at the end of her story.</p>
		<p>Raju ventured thoughtfully, ‘To me the ant represents human beings. Along with all the capabilities, the ant shares some human shortcomings. Sometimes we don’t really use our analytical skills and critical thinking and lose out’.</p>
		<p>‘How could the ant carry into the tiny hole the large leaf that it had managed to carefully bring to the destination? If you were the ant what would you have done?’ Amina teased the group.</p>
		<p>‘Well, I would have bit into the leaf and broken it into pieces..’. Hemant offered.</p>
		<p>‘Very nice. But that would have taken a long time. So, I would call my team members from the dwelling out and all of us would quickly have broken the leaf into tiny pieces and carried them in..’. Ashish said with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
		<p>Everyone clapped at that suggestion. ‘So much for the team spirit. We know ants make great teams’ commented Anjali.</p>
		<p>‘Critical thinking is called ‘higher order thinking skill’(HOTS). We need to cultivate this as it is very useful in higher education, scientific studies and also in our responsible career which involves a lot of problem solving which will be our next topic’ Nandita said when she read the stories they brought.</p>
