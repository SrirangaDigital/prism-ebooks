		<p>When Nandita announced the topic for gathering stories that would tell us about problem solving Raju recalled the story of the girl who saved her merchant father from the clutches of the greedy old money lender. This story is given by Edward De Bono in his book Lateral Thinking as an illustration.</p>
		<p>Nandita gave them a story of the professor and his students.</p>
		<p><em>A group of friends visited their old university professor. Conversation soon turned to complaints about ‘STRESS’ and ‘TENSION’ in Life.</em></p>
		<p><em>The professor offered them coffee and returned from kitchen with coffee in different kinds of cups. Some were glass cups, crystal cups, shining ones and some plain, some were ordinary and some were expensive ones and some very old and chipped.</em></p>
		<p><em>When all of them had a cup in hand, the professor said, ‘If you noticed, all the nice looking and expensive cups are taken up, leaving behind the ordinary ones. Every one of you wanted the best cups, and that is the source of your STRESS and TENSION. In fact, what you really wanted was ‘Coffee’, not the ‘Cup’! However, you still went for the best cup.</em></p>
		<p><em>If life is coffee, then jobs, money, status and love etc. are the cups. They are just TOOLS to hold and contain Life.</em></p>
		<p><em>Please don’t let the CUPS drive you. Enjoy the COFFEE.</em></p>
		<p><em>What is life? </em></p>
		<p><em>They say it’s from B to D... from Birthday to Death. But what’s between B and D?</em></p>
		<p><em>It’s a ‘C‘ Choice ...</em></p>
		<p><em>Our life is a matter of choices...</em></p>
		<p><em>Live well and it will never go wrong....</em></p>
		<p>Amina brought the story she read about an old lady at the bank.</p>
		<p><em>An old lady handed her bank card to a bank teller and said, ‘I would like to withdraw $500’. </em></p>
		<p><em>The female teller told her, ‘For withdrawals less than $5,000, please use the ATM’. </em></p>
		<p><em>The old lady then asked, ‘Why?’ The teller irritably told her, ‘These are rules. Please leave if there is no other matter. There is a queue behind you’. She then returned the card to the old lady. </em></p>
		<p><em>The old lady remained silent. But she returned the card to the teller and said, ‘Please help me withdraw all the money I have’. </em></p>
		<p><em>The teller was astonished when she checked the account balance. She nodded her head, leaned down and said to the old lady, ‘My apologies Granny, you have $3.5 billion in your account and our bank does not have so much cash currently. Could you make an appointment and come again tomorrow?’</em></p>
		<p><em>The old lady then asked, ‘How much am I able to withdraw now?’ </em></p>
		<p><em>The teller told her, ‘Any amount up to $300,000’. </em></p>
		<p><em>The old lady then told the teller that she wanted to withdraw $300,000 from her account. The teller did so quickly and handed it to the old lady respectfully. The old lady kept $500 in her bag and asked the teller to deposit the balance of $299,500 back into her account. The teller was dumbfounded. </em></p>
		<p>‘The story illustrates two things to us. One, that rules are inflexible but we humans can be flexible when the situation requires us to be. We should not treat people based on their looks or how they are dressed. Second, the quick decision-making skills of the old lady who did not get angry or throw tantrums but calmly solved her problem and also taught a lesson to the teller at the counter’ Amina explained.</p>
		<p>‘Here is a beautiful story of not only problem solving but also a lot of positive thinking’. Hemant read out his story.</p>
		<p><em>Once upon a time two brothers, who lived on adjoining farms, fell into conflict. It was the first serious rift in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery and trading labour and goods as needed without a conflict. Then the long collaboration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. </em></p>
		<p><em>One morning there was a knock-on John’s door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter’s tool box. ‘I’m looking for a few days’ work’ he said. ‘Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with? Could I help you?’‘Yes,’ said the older brother. ‘I do have a job for you’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Look across the creek at that farm. That’s my neighbour; in fact, it’s my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow between us and he took his bulldozer to the river levee and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I’ll do him one better’.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘See that pile of lumber by the barn? I want you to build me a fence, an 8-foot fence, so I won’t need to see his place or face anymore’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The carpenter said, ‘I think I understand the situation. Show me the nails and the post-hole digger and I’ll be able to do a job that pleases you’.</em></p>
		<p><em>The older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing. At about sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. </em></p>
		<p><em>The farmer’s eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge, a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work, handrails and all—and the neighbour, his younger brother, was coming toward them, his hand outstretched. ‘You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I’ve said and done’. The two brothers stood at each end of the bridge and then they met in the middle, taking each other’s hand. </em></p>
		<p><em>They turned to see the carpenter hoist his toolbox onto his shoulder. ‘No, wait! Stay a few days. I’ve a lot of other projects for you,’ said the older brother. ‘I’d love to stay on,’ the carpenter said, ‘but I have many more bridges to build’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Well, we listened to the episode of simple looks that Anjali gave us earlier. I have another episode from the life of Ishwarachandra Vidyasagar, the great Sanskrit scholar and philanthropist’. Ashish read out the episode.</p>
		<p><em>This happened some time during the latter half of 1800s. Sri IshwarachandraVidyasagar and his friends were collecting donations to start Calcutta University.</em></p>
		<p><em>One day Vidyasagar stopped at the door of the palace of the Nawab of Ayodhya. The Nawab was not exactly known to be a generous person and many people tried to dissuade Vidyasagar from taking up this mission.</em></p>
		<p><em>Vidyasagar met the Nawab and presented his cause. On hearing Vidyasagar’s plea, the Nawab got up, pulled out one of his shoes and dropped it in Vidyasagar’s bag for donation. He kept his cool, got up, thanked the Nawab and left.</em></p>
		<p><em>On the next day Vidyasagar organised an auction of Nawab’s shoe in front of his palace. A number of Nawab’s knights, Jagirdars, court members, who wanted to impress the Nawab started bidding. By mid afternoon the shoe was sold for Rs. 1000.</em></p>
		<p><em>The Nawab, happy to hear that his shoe fetched Rs 1000, matched the auction money. He added his own Rs. 1000 as donation.</em></p>
		<p><em>Calcutta University became a reality. It became a center of education for fine arts, social studies, science and technology.</em></p>
		<p>Anjali clapped and said, ‘Wow! He had so many options. When the Nawab dropped a shoe in his basket, Vidyasagar could have walked out furious. He could have thrown the shoe at the Nawab as an answer for the insult. He could have got depressed and given up his efforts to raise donation for the university. But he did nothing of that sort’.</p>
		<p>Swapna added, ‘True. He remained focused on the main goal. He exploited the situation creatively. We need to learn to keep cool in adverse situations and turn them to our advantage’.</p>
		<p>‘Sometimes the ability to solve problems comes from experience and observation and not from educational qualifications. Simple solutions come with the use of common sense. Listen to this story’. Amina read out her story.</p>
		<p><em>This is about some big company manufacturing cars.</em></p>
		<p><em>While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is two inches taller than the entrance.</em></p>
		<p><em>The engineer felt bad that he didn’t notice this one before creating the car.</em></p>
		<p><em>The owner was amazed on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area. The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later on. The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out and later re-do it. The owner was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch.</em></p>
		<p><em>A Watchman was observing all the drama and slowly approached the owner. He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem. They wondered what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give. The watchman said ‘The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out.’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Everyone clapped!!!</em></p>
		<p>‘Don’t analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone. There is always a layman’s outlook that gives an alternate solution at a given point of time. So, we need to respect opinions of employees down the ladder’. Observed Raju. </p>
		<p>‘This can go as an example of lateral thinking which is useful in problem solving. We have already learnt the usefulness of lateral thinking’. said Swapna. </p>
