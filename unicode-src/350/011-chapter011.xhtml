		<p class="myquote"><strong>To know oneself, one should assert oneself.</strong></p>
		<p class="quote-author"> Albert Camus</p>
		<p class="myquote"><strong>To be passive is to let others decide for you. To be aggressive is to decide for others. To be assertive is to decide for yourself. And to trust that there is enough, that you are enough.</strong></p>

		<p>That day Swapna and Anjali had a short discussion about assertiveness and arrogance. They asked Nandita to resolve the argument.</p>
		<p>‘Being assertive means being able to stand up for your own or other people’s rights in a calm and positive way, without being either aggressive, or passively accepting ‘wrong’.</p>
		<p>Assertive individuals are able to get their point across without being aggressive and without upsetting others or becoming upset themselves. Remember how Abraham Lincoln responded to his colleague who wanted to upset him? Besides preserving his self-esteem, the episode also speaks of his assertiveness. All of you know about Mahatma Gandhi. Let me tell you about his assertiveness’. Nandita continued.</p>
		<p><em>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi landed at Durban in May 1893. His employer Dada Abdulla, one of the wealthiest Indian merchants in Natal, took him to see the Durban court. When the European magistrate ordered Gandhi to take off his turban, he refused, left the court- room and wrote a letter of protest in the local press in which he was mentioned ‘as an unwelcome visitor’. The experience in Durban, however, was nothing compared with what he encountered during his journey from Durban to Pretoria. When his train reached Maritzburg late in the evening, he was ordered to leave the first-class compartment and shift to the van compartment. He refused but was unceremoniously turned out of the carriage. It was a bitterly cold night as he slowly walked into the unlit waiting- room of Maritzburg station and brooded over what had happened. His client had given him no warning of the humiliating conditions under which Indians lived in South Africa. He was in two minds to call off the contract and return to India or to accept these affronts as part of the bargain.</em></p>
		<p><em> So far, Gandhi had not been conspicuous for assertiveness; on the contrary he had been very shy and retiring. But something happened to him in that wind-swept waiting- room of Maritzburg railway station as he smarted under the insult inflicted on him. This incident was one of the most creative experiences of his life. From that hour, he refused to accept injustice as a part of the natural- or unnatural- order in South Africa. He would reason, he would plead; he would appeal to the better judgment and the latent humanity of the ruling race. He would resist, but he would never be a willing victim of racial arrogance. It was not so much a question of redeeming his own self-respect as that of his community, his country, even of humanity. And this assertiveness of Gandhiji led us in our struggle for freedom. </em></p>
		<p>‘Remember, no one can hurt you without your consent. It is not what happens to us that hurts us. It is our response that hurts us’ Nandita remarked as she concluded her narration.</p>
		<p>On Saturday all of them gathered to share their stories with others.</p>
		<p>Hemant came up with an excellent story of the legendary Dhruva.</p>
		<p><em>Dhruva was son of the King Uttanapada (the son of </em><em>Svayambhuva Manu</em><em>) and his wife Suniti. The king also had another son Uttama, born to his second queen Suruchi, who was the king’s favourite. Once, when Dhruva was a child of five years of age, he was sitting on his father’s lap at the King’s throne. Suruchi, who was jealous of the older son from the king’s first wife, forcefully dragged Dhruva away from his father’s lap. When Dhruva protested and asked if he could not be allowed to sit on his father’s lap, Suruchi berated him saying; ‘only God can allow you that privilege. Go ask him’.</em></p>
		<p><em>Suniti - being of gentle nature and now the lesser favourite wife, tried to console the distraught child, but Dhruva was determined to hear of his fate from the Lord himself! Seeing his firm resolve, his mother bade him farewell as he set out on a lonely journey to the forest. Dhruva was determined to seek for himself his rightful place and noticing this resolve, the divine sage Narada appeared before him and tried to dissuade him from the severe austerity at such an early age. But, Dhruva was determined, so the sage guided him towards his goal by teaching him the rituals of meditation. Dhruva started his meditation and went without food and water for six months, his mind fixed on the Lord. </em></p>
		<p><em>When Vishnu was pleased with Dhruva’s tapasya and asked him to ask for a boon. Having spent a long time in the state of penance he had forgotten the objective of his tapasya and only asked for a life in memory of the Lord. Vishnu granted his wish and further decreed that the lad would attain Dhruvapada</em> <em>- the state where he would become a celestial body which would not be touched by even a deluge</em>.</p>
		<p><em>Dhruva returned to his kingdom, to be warmly received by his family and attained the crown at the age of six. He ruled for many decades in a fair and just manner.</em></p>
		<p>‘What a wonderful story of assertion from the Hindu mythology!’ Amina commented.</p>
		<p>‘I have an excerpt from the speech of a great leader of the world. Martin Luther King Jr. We know the assertiveness with which he led his people and worked towards abolishing slavery in America. This is taken from his famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech’. Raju gave copies of the excerpt to everyone.</p>
		<p>‘<em>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.</em></p>
		<p><em>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</em></p>
		<p><em>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’.</em></p>
		<p><em>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</em></p>
		<p><em>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</em></p>
		<p><em>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</em></p>
		<p><em>I have a dream</em> <em>today</em>!</p>
		<p>Nandita said, ‘Assertiveness is an essential quality of a leader. It instils confidence in others. Next we will talk about leadership qualities and team spirit’</p>
