		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>Team spirit and leadership qualities means not only being cooperative but allowing enough space for others.</em></strong></p>
		<p class="myquote"><strong><em>You will achieve the greatest results in business and career if you drop the word ‘achievement’ from your vocabulary. Replace it with ‘contribution’.</em></strong></p>

		<p>That day Nandita looked happy. She was happy with the solidarity with which Raju and his friends were working. She happened to meet the Principal of their college at a conference and he told her how much good the group’s initiative was doing in creating a positive atmosphere in the college.</p>
		<p>‘Today, let us discuss ‘team spirit and leadership’ she announced as soon as she entered the room. ‘What do you understand by team spirit?’</p>
		<p>‘I think it is a group working together’ Hemant paused and added, ‘Actually, it is a group coming together to work on a common goal’.</p>
		<p>‘Yes. As Henry Ford said, ‘Coming together is the beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success’. What are the conditions under which a group can work together and well?’ Nandita asked.</p>
		<p>‘There should be understanding among the members of the team’. Tejas said.</p>
		<p>‘Absolutely correct. Team work operates with some principles like unity, cooperation, compassion, fellow feeling, contribution to success and accountability. Team work involves caring and sharing. It is also division of labour. Each member is assigned a specific task and he or she does it in time with knowledge that if a person neglects to work on time it affects the work of the entire group. So, there should be cooperation among the members. This is called group dynamics’.</p>
		<p>‘I understand this. But what happens if one person is slow or shy and lags behind others? After all everyone doesn’t have the same abilities..’. Hemant put forth his doubt a little hesitatingly. The entire group understood his genuine concern. Hemant in the group always struggled to meet the deadlines. He was very conscious of it.</p>
		<p>‘Yes Hemant. You are right. This is where the ‘caring and sharing spirit’ of the group helps. I will illustrate this with an example I like very much. Nandita paused and took out a small newspaper clipping. It read like this:</p>
		<p><em>In certain regions in South Africa, when someone does something wrong, he is taken to the centre of the village and surrounded by his tribe for two days while they speak of all the good he has done. They believe each person is good, yet sometimes we make mistakes, which is really a cry for help. They unite in this ritual to encourage the person to reconnect with his true nature. The belief is that unity and affirmation have more power to change behaviour than shame and punishment. This is known as UBUNTU- humanity towards others. </em></p>
		<p>When she finished reading all of them had a smile on their faces. ‘Oh, another UBUNTU story’ - all of them seemed to be thinking.</p>
		<p> It was obvious that they liked it. Each one made a mental note of it and resolved to practise it. </p>
		<p>‘When I think of team spirit I remember the story from Panchatantra I read when I was a child. I am sure all you know it’ Anjali said when they met on Saturday.</p>
		<p>‘In any case let’s have it’. Amina said.</p>
		<p>‘OK. It goes like this’.</p>
		<p><em>There was a flock of robust pigeons. A hunter wanted to trap them. He started throwing some grains to attract them. The young pigeons wanted to feed on the easy to get food. The experienced and old pigeon among them suspected something foul and asked them to resist the temptation. But all of them wanted to go for it. So, they flew down to feed on the grains. True enough the hunter had spread a net where the grain was spread. The birds couldn’t see the net and when they perched to peck at the grains their feet got caught in the net. The birds understood the foul play but did not know what to do to escape. Again, the elderly pigeon gave them an idea. She asked them to flap their wings and start flying simultaneously. Together they took flight along with the net. Of course, they went to their good friend, the rat, who cut the net to pieces and set them free.</em></p>
		<p>‘This gives us not only a lesson in team spirit but also the decision making of the leader’. Anjali observed.</p>
		<p>Raju said, ‘Ah, I can give another story of our childhood. All of us know the story of the stomach and the body parts. When the body parts thought that they were just feeding the stomach and decided not to work and subsequently all of them became weak as there was no nourishment or there was no work for the stomach to digest. Sometimes the contribution of one member may not be very obvious but we cannot discount that member’s contribution to the teamwork’.</p>
		<p>‘Correct. We should understand that when it is division of labour, each person’s contribution is unique, however subtle it may be’. Swapna opined.</p>
		<p>Ashish said, ‘I read about the geese in flight’.</p>
		<p>‘Oh, another lesson from geese’ Hemant commented. </p>
		<p>Ashish smiled and continued:</p>
		<p>‘<em>Geese fly in groups in a V formation. Each bird flaps its wing creating an uplift for the following bird. In a V-formation the whole flock adds at least 71% more flying range than if they flew alone. Whenever a goose falls out of the formation it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to fly alone and quickly follows the formation. As it gets back into the formation another takes its position. Geese at the back of the formation honk at the one at the front to encourage them to keep up their speed. When the lead goose tires, it rotates back into the formation and another goose flies to the point position’.</em></p>
		<p>‘Wow, another lesson from Nature is how we developed our aerodynamics’. Amina was very pleased and said, ‘It shows caring and sharing. Teamwork survives when we respect each other’s contribution and share work’</p>
		<p>‘Very well said. Now, it is true that there should be understanding among the members of the team. They should share the work for the team’s success. But there should also be somebody who keeps them together and leads them. What do you say?’ said Raju.</p>
		<p>‘I think we do need such a person, if not always, most of the time. Not all of us are made of the stuff for becoming a team leader’. Ashish said.</p>
		<p>Nandita laughed at that. ‘Well, one can always try. There are certain qualities a team leader should cultivate. The team leader takes major decisions and should shoulder the responsibility of success or failure of the entire team. He or she should know the weaknesses and strengths of each member. The first thing one should remember as a team leader is never to forsake any member’. Nandita paused and continued.</p>
		<p>‘I remember what is said about Dr. Satish Dhawan, former Chairman, ISRO. This anecdote was given by another great man Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.</p>
		<p><em>That was the first time India was building its own rocket launch vehicle in Sri Harikota, India. After ten years of hard struggle, they were ready to launch their first satellite ‘Rohini’ in 1979</em><strong><em>. </em></strong><em>Dr. Kalam</em> was the <em>Project Director</em> <em>of the</em> <em>mission and </em><em>Prof. Satish Dhawan</em> was the <em>Chairman of ISRO</em> at that time. <em>The Countdown started and Dr. Abdul Kalam along with six other experts was monitoring the launch anxiously. When it was four minutes before the satellite launch, the computer began to go through the checklist of items that needed to be checked. One minute later, the computer program put the launch on hold; the display showed that some control components were not in order. Everyone was stunned not knowing whether to proceed or not. The whole country was waiting for the good news.</em></p>
		<p><em>The experts advised Dr. Abdul Kalam to go ahead with the launch and they were confident about their calculations. Dr. Kalam had to take the decision to bypass the computer, switched to manual mode and launched the rocket. In the first stage, everything worked fine. In the second stage, a problem developed. Instead of the satellite going into orbit, the whole rocket system plunged into the Bay of Bengal. It was a big failure. The next year, in July 1980, the team headed by Dr Kalam successfully launched the satellite and made the nation proud. Again, there was a press conference. Prof. Dhawan asked Dr Kalam to conduct the press conference that day’.</em></p>
		<p>Nandita paused and asked.‘So, what do you learn from the anecdote?’</p>
		<p>‘When failure occurred, the leader of the organization owned that failure. When success came, he gave it to his team’. Swapna was quick to answer.</p>
		<p>‘Quite a difficult thing for a human being. Normally people would like to identify themselves with success’. quipped Tejas.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, that is why leaders are a class apart’. observed Hemant.</p>
		<p>‘It is time for you to get your stories on leadership qualities’. Nandita left them musing about the two great men of India.</p>
		<p>‘We learnt about Dr Dhawan. I have another story from ISRO’. Amina then read out her story.</p>
		<p><em>About seventy scientists were working on an important project. All of them were under great pressure of meeting the deadline. They had a very demanding boss. But as they were very loyal to him, none of them even thought of quitting due to the intense pressure of work.</em></p>
		<p><em>One day, one of the scientists went to the boss and said, ‘Sir, I have promised my children that I will take them to the exhibition that is going on in the township. So, I want to leave office at 5.30 in the evening today’. His boss gave him permission to leave the office early. The scientist began his work for the day. He continued his work after lunch. As usual he got involved in his project to such an extent that he looked at his watch only when he thought he was close to completion. It was 8.30 pm. Suddenly he remembered his promise to his children. Then he peeped into his boss’s chamber. His boss was not there. He must have left. The scientist felt guilty that he could not keep the promise made to his children. He reached home thinking of what he should tell his disappointed children. His wife was in the sitting room reading some magazine. He didn’t find his children at home. His wife got up from her chair and asked him ‘Shall I make some coffee for you or if you are hungry, I’ll serve you dinner straight away?’ The scientist was puzzled. ‘Is it the clam before the storm?’ he thought and said, ‘I’d like to have some coffee. But where are the children?’</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Oh, don’t you know this? Your boss came at 5.30 and took the children to the exhibition’, much to the amazement of the scientist. What actually happened was, his boss had seen him engrossed in his work around 5.30 and thought, ‘this man is not likely to remember anything other than his work at the moment, not even his promise to his children. But they should not be disappointed because of this’. So, he quietly left the office and reached the scientist’s home and took the children to the exhibition to fulfil their dad’s promise to them.</em></p>
		<p><em>He didn’t have to do such things every day. That is why all the scientists at Thumba continued to work under their boss even though the stress of work was tremendous. They were all loyal to him. The boss was none other than Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam, the great scientist who became the President of India later.</em></p>
		<p>When Amina completed her story everyone spontaneously clapped in appreciation.</p>
		<p>‘What a great person!’ exclaimed Tejas.</p>
		<p>‘This is true leadership. A sensitive person, who is compassionate, is aware of the requirement of the members of his team, is helpful and understanding; he is a person who leads not by precepts but by practice’. </p>
		<p>‘I remember the story where the Director said,<em> ‘I want to recruit a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others to get things done and a person who would not put money as his only goal in life’.</em> I think a true leader understands his juniors and gets involved in their commitments’. Swapna offered her comment, recalling an earlier story read out to them.</p>
		<p>‘But a true leader also understands how much help to be offered. One should not be overprotective. That may hamper the growth of the individuals. I have a story to illustrate this. I have given the information about the barnacle goslings some time ago. I have more to tell you about these geese. I will briefly tell you about the leadership quality of the mother bird and then give you another story’. Raju said.</p>
		<p><em>Chicks are always naturally dependant on their mothers. In the BBC documentary about the barnacle geese, I saw that the mother goose stations herself on the ground so that the chicks take that steep dive. The chicks follow wherever she goes and by diving, they are basically making an effort to be with their mother. Most of them survive the plunge.</em></p>
		<p>Raju looked around for comments.</p>
		<p>‘I think for the employees to make that extra mile, to meet the new challenges, the leader should first win them over’. Ashish said.</p>
		<p>‘Yes, the leader should be able to push them to make an extra effort without their conscious knowledge’. Hemant said thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>‘I think the story where the father asked his son to teach him Physics, Chemistry etc. was doing exactly that. The father has a lot of leadership qualities’ commented Swapna.</p>
		<p>‘OK. Now let me read out the story’ Raju started reading.</p>
		<p><em>In two independent houses separated by a compound two people were living, in one a retired person and in the other a techie.</em></p>
		<p><em>They had planted identical saplings on either side of the compound.</em></p>
		<p><em>The techie used to give lot of water and manure to the plants. The retired used just a small quantity of water and little manure.</em></p>
		<p><em>The techie’s plant grew into lush green, leafy robust plant.</em></p>
		<p><em>The retired person’s plant was a near normal but much luxuriant than his neighbour’s.</em></p>
		<p><em>One night there was a heavy rain with gusty wind.</em></p>
		<p><em>Next morning both came out to see the fate of the plants.</em></p>
		<p><em>To techie’s surprise, his plant had got uprooted whereas the plant of his neighbour was unharmed.</em></p>
		<p><em>Techie asked the retired as to why his plant was uprooted despite such a good care where as the neighbour had hardly cared.</em></p>
		<p><em>The retired person’s answer should be a lesson for all of us.</em></p>
		<p><em>‘Look young man, you had supplied everything a plant would need, in abundance and the plant did not have to go in search of it. Your roots did not have go down. I was supplying just enough to keep them alive. For the rest roots had to go down into the ground to fulfil their needs.</em></p>
		<p><em>Since your roots were superficial the rain and wind could easily fell them. Since my roots were pretty deeply grounded they could withstand the onslaught of the nature.</em></p>
		<p><em>I was supplying just enough to keep it alive. For the rest roots had to go down into the ground to fulfil its needs’.</em></p>
		<p>‘A good leader nurtures the inherent qualities of the members and allows others in the team to grow. He will not spoon feed them but teaches them to be independent’.</p>
		<p>‘In <strong><em>Doing What Matters</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> James Kilts, former chairman and CEO of Gillette Company, shares a story about developing people. Here is what he said’. Raju took out his notebook to read out.</p>
		<p><em>One of the most important responsibilities of a leader is to create the right environment and then give the employees development opportunities that enable them to realize their full potential. I like to use an analogy that I heard some years ago of the Japanese carp, known as the koi, to make the point. </em></p>
		<p><em>The fascinating thing about the koi is that if you keep it in a small fish bowl, it will grow to be only about two to three inches long. Place the koi in a larger tank or small pond and it will reach six to ten inches. Put it in a large pond and it may get as long as a foot and a half. However, if you put it in a huge lake where it can really stretch out, it has the potential to reach sizes up to three feet.</em></p>
		<p><em>People, like the koi, will grow to the dimensions of their boundaries. Fortunately, unlike koi, we have the advantage of helping our people select their boundaries. And it is the leader’s job to set the kind of boundaries that allow people to reach their full potential.</em></p>
		<p>‘So, a leader should be able to identify the potential of the people who work with him or her and nurture and nourish the growth of the individuals around’.</p>
		<p>‘A leader takes care of the team, identifies talents, nurtures them and allows them to grow. But leaders are also humans. Who will take care of them?’ Swapna said thoughtfully. </p>
		<p>Nandita had a good laugh at the question. ‘A very relevant question. I’ll give the answer through this short story’. She narrated.</p>
		<p><em>There was a cobbler in a big village. As he was the only cobbler available, everyone went to him to get their footwear repaired. Since he was so busy he didn’t have time to mend his own boots. This was not a problem at first, but over a time his boots started wearing off and falling apart. While he was repairing everyone’s shoes his feet developed blisters and he started to limp. His customers started to worry about him. But he assured them that everything was alright and continued working.</em></p>
		<p><em>However, after a time his feet were so injured that he could no longer go to work. As a result, people’s footwear started piling up for repair. The entire village started limping in pain. All this is because the cobbler didn’t make time to repair his own boots. </em></p>
		<p>Nandita looked around at the young faces and said, ‘If you are in a responsible position and an important link in a group you need to be in good shape. You should take care of yourself. Otherwise you will not be good enough to anyone else either’.</p>
		<p>‘Hm, so the leader has a double responsibility. She has to take care of herself as well as others’. Swapna quipped.</p>
		<p class="vertical-delimiter" />
		<p>The RAASTHA team’s efforts did not go waste. The stories appeared on the special notice board of their college. In the beginning, only a few students went and read the stories and enjoyed, at the same time learnt lessons of life. After the quiz was put up, more number of students started thronging the place. The notice board arena became very popular gradually. The word got spread and friends of the college students started reading the stories whenever they found time.</p>
		<p>The Principal was very appreciative of the team’s efforts. He called them one day and said ‘Very good job. I met Principals of some other colleges in a meeting. They mentioned the good work started by you in our college and want to start similar projects in their colleges too. This should continue even after you leave the institution. Prepare your juniors to carry on the work’.</p>
		<p>The stories building life skills continued to appear. Teachers started using them in their classes and made them activity oriented and also started using them to give projects.</p>
