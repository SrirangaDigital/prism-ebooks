		<p class="myquote"><em>‘The deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated.’</em></p>
		<p class="quote-author"><em>William James</em></p>
		<p>However, in my journey with each one of you, I saw beyond this craving, a genuine ‘giving’ filled with generosity. I have no words to express what I experienced. Hence I am quoting the words of some well-known people to express my gratitude.</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>‘No one who achieves success does so </em> <em>without the help of others.’</em></p>
		<p class="quote-author"><em>Alfred North Whitehead</em></p>
		<p>I acknowledge the contribution of each one of you with gratitude:</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>‘Gratitude is when memory is stored </em> <em>in the heart and not in the mind.’</em></p>
		<p class="quote-author"><em>Lionel Hampton</em></p>
		<p>Each one of you has engraved yourself in my heart and mind.</p>
		<p class="myquote">‘I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.’ </p>
		<p class="quote-author"><em>Gilbert C. Chesterton</em></p>
		<p>I feel wonderful with all of you around and with me, in this journey of becoming an author. I have made new friends and amazing relationships have evolved and I have been able to see the hidden talents of many. These relationships have been the force that made me get up and write when I was stuck or when I questioned myself - Should I even do this?’</p>
		<p>‘Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.’ </p>
		<p class="quote-author"><em>Melody Beattie</em></p>
