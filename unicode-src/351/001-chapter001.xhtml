		<p><em>‘This is you. You have your eyes, hands and legs to use for yourself. We have given you the necessary education. The whole world is at your doorstep. Go and explore. Deal with it on your own.’</em></p>
		<p>Late one night, I received a call. A choking voice blurted out: ‘Ma’am... ma’am this client, he just wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say...he was raving and ranting all through the session. He wanted instant remedies. And then....he...I... I’m so confused and hassled...what do I do? How do I deal with this?’ </p>
		<p>I said, ‘ <em>Listen. At this moment, I don’t hear a psychologist reporting. This behaviour is unacceptable!’</em></p>
		<p>Silence. </p>
		<p>After a long pause, she said, ‘Ma’am, I’ll call you  back in some time.’</p>
		<p>A young psychologist interning under me was on the phone. </p>
		<p>She called the next morning. She briefed me about the case: the background, the present situation and stated her diagnosis. Only at the end, she highlighted her concerns. </p>
		<p>What a transformation! I thought. </p>
		<p>She was not ‘reacting’ like last night, but was ‘responding’ to the situation. She was methodical and mature. No longer overwhelmed by ‘emotion’, she had applied her ‘mind’, and her approach was solution-oriented. She did not ask for solutions but sought them by digging deep into her own resources: her knowledge and experience, and, facts of the case. </p>
		<p>‘Now you sound balanced and professional.’</p>
		<p>She said, ‘Ma’am, your words made a difference. After speaking to you, I sat myself down; relaxed and invoked my knowledge and experience with confidence. I looked at the facts from multiple angles. I studied the details of the client and recalled the interaction I had had with him during the counselling session. I realised the issue had gripped me so much that I failed to distinguish between objective data and my personal feelings and prejudices. I read the facts and the diagnosis again and again. I began to see the situation in a different light altogether. You challenged me to step out of my comfort zone. I had grown excessively dependent on you. I expected you to dish out answers, not realizing that my growth would be stunted. Now I understand that I can deal with my clients effectively if I use my resources efficiently.’</p>
		<p>My intern’s words, ‘you challenged me’, took me down memory lane to a night at the end of my summer holidays when I sat packing my school bag in preparation for the first day of 9th  grade. My mother came into my room, handed me an alarm clock and wristwatch and said, nonchalantly, ‘Here, this is for you. You must perform well. Do the needful.’</p>
		<p>This was her way of preparing me for the board exams. Her message was clear. I would have to wake myself up in the mornings to study. This was my first lesson in time-management, self-reliance and responsibility. </p>
		<p>A similar dialogue from my mother came to me during a phase of transition. Armed with an M. Phil Degree, I was on the threshold of embarking on a career. </p>
		<p>The excitement of earning the degree had waned and the anxiety of an uncertain future loomed large. I asked my mother, ‘Now what?’ </p>
		<p>‘This is you. You have your eyes, hands and legs to use for yourself. We have given you the necessary education. The whole world is at your doorstep. Go, explore and deal with it on your own.’ </p>
		<p>She walked away. She was harsh, I thought. I recovered from the initial shock and began to ponder over her words. It dawned on me that her words were meant to challenge me to look ‘within’ for answers. I soon found myself starting a private practice in addition to taking up the position of a clinical psychologist at a school for specially-abled children.</p>
		<p>In both instances, my mother had dared me to push my boundaries. The impact was two-pronged; one, to discover my inner strength and harness my knowledge and experience to make independent decisions; and, second, to own responsibility. Thereafter, I still discussed issues with my mother, but didn’t seek answers from her; I sought her perspectives but made my own decisions. Opportunities are boundless for the one who seeks!</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Challenge and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>We live in a world defined by rapid changes in every sphere of life. The pace of change is so swift that the pressure to measure up and excel has manifold implications on our performance and health. The need to constantly update, relearn and unlearn can hardly be emphasised. As Alvin Toffler has said, ‘The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.’ While the younger generation is fuelled by ambition and is focused on achievement, it also finds itself amidst a work culture that thrives on stiff competition and demands increasing levels of excellence. </p>
			<p>The one who challenges (mentor) may be a boss, a coach, a parent, a friend or a sibling. There is an inherent ‘understanding’ between the mentor and the one being challenged (mentee) - which means that in a given situation, the mentor is in a position of authority or trust  <em>vis-a-vis</em> the mentee. For instance, a boss or a coach is in a position of command; and, a friend, in a position of being trustworthy. A simple example is an older sibling telling a younger sibling, ‘I haven’t seen you practice. How will you learn if you don’t practice?’ Or a friend who says, ‘You haven’t even tried. How will you know if you’ll succeed?’</p>
			<p class="myquote">The technique of Challenging has a dual purpose:
				<ul>
					<li>To enhance performance</li> 
					<li>To initiate change in perspective</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Over the years, there has been a surge in students, professionals and sports persons seeking ways to continually push themselves to perform better by learning smarter techniques. As professional counsellors, we provide alternative viewpoints that can work for them based on their current performance, so they adhere to a lifelong process of challenging themselves and knowing when to draw the line.</p>
			<p>Talking about the professional context, I recollect an experience shared by a participant during a Life Coaching session. </p>
			<p>‘For the first time in my two-year long career, I  feel extremely incompetent. I have been working on this project for six months now. Despite my best efforts, I failed on my deliverables. I got an earful from my manager. Soon enough, I got a call from the HR manager. My first thought was  - Alright! I am fired! I confessed to the HR manager that despite working overtime and on weekends, I had failed to reach the target. The manager only said - Have you tried to crack the ‘code’ of the challenge? </p>
			<p>The HR manager’s words proved to be a turnaround. That one question got me thinking. She had just pushed me to work smarter, not harder. I spent time on equipping myself with more knowledge about the subject. I did some research. I understood the crux of the matter. All this while, I had been working mechanically and did not have conceptual clarity. My speed improved by 50% the next day and by the end of the week, I was able to reach my targets.’</p>
			<p>However, certain preconditions are necessary for the technique of challenging to yield the desired results. That brings us to the question: What is the ecosystem that must be present for the technique of challenging to be exercised and for it to yield the expected results?</p>
			<p>The most important element of this ecosystem is the presence of a certain ‘understanding’ between the one challenging and the one being challenged.</p>
			<p>This ‘understanding’ is a two -way process. The mentee must be able to identify certain traits in the mentor. Similarly, the mentor should be able to recognise certain characteristics in the mentee. </p>
			<p><strong>Let’s first look at it from the perspective of the mentee:</strong></p>
			<p>Going back to my intern, she was taking initial steps in her career and had worked with me for six months on a project. Thereafter, she approached me for internship. She had vested in me the responsibility to train and guide her. I was in a position of authority. Authority comes from my subject matter expertise and my position of being a qualified and experienced therapist. A manager, a coach or a trainer is an expert in a specific subject, which gives him a position of authority and is hence qualified to challenge. </p>
			<p>However, authority alone is not sufficient. My intern had assessed and determined my credibility. Based on her experience of working with me for six months, she had developed faith and trust in me. She had probably assessed my knowledge, professional experience and personal traits, and, was perhaps confident that I would assist her in her evolution as a mature professional. Credibility can also be established through recommendation. Nevertheless, the mentee should, over the first couple of sessions or interactions, be able to build faith in a mentor’s skills and intentions. </p>

			<p><strong>Let’s look at it from the perspective of the mentor.</strong></p>
			<p>As a mentor, you have to be perceptive to certain qualities in your mentee before you can challenge.</p>

			</figure>
			<p><strong>Clearly Articulated Intent</strong> - In professional counselling, if the client is seeking to enhance performance, then the ‘understanding’ is explicit and initiated by the client. The mentee must have expressed explicitly or implicitly, her acceptance of your role as a  mentor. In the case of my intern, she had clearly articulated her need for performance enhancement. She had said, ‘I’d  like to intern under you, ma’am. I think you can help me evolve into an efficient counsellor and guide me in my career.’ </p>
			<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - The mentee must be motivated to learn and improve. If the mentee is coerced to seek help, then motivate the mentee first and then challenge.</p>
			<p><strong>Action Oriented</strong> - Intent alone is not enough. Intent must be translated into action - taking measurable steps to achieve goals. Many sports enthusiasts are willing to be challenged so they can participate in tougher competitions. Challenging oneself is the primary purpose of self-actualization.</p>
			<p><strong>Readiness</strong> - The mentee must be at a stage in her life or career, where she is mature enough and ready to take on a challenge. My intern was on the brink of taking off solo. </p>
			<p><strong>Need for Change</strong> - The mentee must consistently show the need for improvement. Although my intern regularly sought my inputs, she had also become complacent and dependent on me. Although the desire to get a strong foothold in her profession was apparent, she had reached a plateau. That was an indication that she was ready for the next level. I was waiting for an opportunity to challenge her.</p>
			<p>Not always do we need an external agent to challenge us. As we grow and gain maturity, we  learn to challenge and push ourselves. Highly motivated people continuously challenge themselves. It is an effective technique to ensure growth and progress; to achieve personal and relationship goals; and, to enhance performance and realign perspectives. A few challenging words are often  a rude awakening from complacency! </p>
