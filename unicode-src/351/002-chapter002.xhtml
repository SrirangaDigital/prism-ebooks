		<p class="text-center"><em>‘Your silence is a concern for me.’</em></p>
		<p>A couple married for over two decades and with a child aged 17 years, entered my consulting room one evening. The wife wanted separation. She resented her husband’s obsessive nature. She declared she had  <em>never</em> loved her husband. The husband was in a state of shock for he had always believed that he was blessed with a loving wife and an ideal marriage. </p>
		<p>‘I just don’t understand. For twenty years, we have coped quite well with all the vicissitudes of life. I have had no reasons to believe that she didn’t love me. Yes, she never asked for or initiated physical intimacy. She wouldn’t even hold hands when we were out. That is her nature. Always remote and to herself. I had accepted her that way,’ he confided. </p>
		<p>Here was a couple seeking marital counselling for challenges they were facing at an advanced phase of their married life. While handling relationship issues, especially marital, I set the tone for the resolution by stating clearly, that the primary ‘client’ is their ‘marriage’, their relationship and not either of the spouses. I also clearly defined my role in the therapeutic relationship, ‘Neither of you is wrong. Neither of you is right. I am not going to deliver a verdict  in favour of one or the other. I will only try to give my understanding of what has transpired and how we can resolve the issues.’</p>
		<p>My prerogative, therefore, is to treat each of them as persons in their own right; and, to be a patient listener and give equal time and importance to each of them.</p>
		<p>As the rapport built, the husband, during a session, said, ‘I have no inhibitions sharing my issues with you; issues, which I don’t feel comfortable sharing with even my close friends. I feel that you can understand my wife and me. You relate to our experiences well; I am confident that you can help us resolve our differences. <em>You are gender neutral in your approach!’ </em></p>
		<p>His feedback played in my mind that night. His words took me back in time to an event that occurred in the early phase of my career. </p>
		<p>I was a participant in a Personal Growth Lab and one of the sessions focused on gender parity and gender -based -bias and its ramifications on the female psyche, and on society in general. The discussion was intense and the atmosphere, emotionally charged. Just before noon break, a male participant shared an incident about a friend who initiated his daughter-in-law’s remarriage within a few days of his son’s demise. The participant was surprised that the daughter-in-law had failed to appreciate her father-in-law’s nobility and progressive thinking. </p>
		<p>I found myself growing quiet. Present, aware, involved but quiet. I remained so for that entire  session. I experienced a deep disquiet. Anger, disgust and cynicism playing havoc in my mind, I seethed beneath a quiet demeanour. After some time, the facilitator said,  <em>‘You have been quiet for a while now. Your silence is a concern for me.’</em></p>
		<p>At that moment, I broke my silence. For the first  time, I expressed without inhibitions  my views of the patriarchal nature of our society that defines what a woman should do with herself; her emotions and experiences, including her grief and, how she should deal with and express sorrow. Should she even grieve?!! The deep-rooted anger and anguish held for societal norms defined largely by men emerged into my consciousness. In the end, I found myself relieved of a huge burden. I felt free to dance and free to be.</p>
		<p>The facilitator’s words had struck a chord in my heart. ‘Your silence is a concern for me’ - I found myself a recipient of EMPATHY. The timing, the choice of words, the thought and feeling behind those words were so potent that it indeed was transformational and it lent a new dimension to my experiential landscape. </p>
		<p>Why was this seemingly quotidian incident so powerful? Why do I call it transformational? </p>
		<p>The facilitator had observed me, and he was concerned. That by itself was cathartic. I felt that he stood by me in the painful experience of being denied space to express my emotions and ideas as a woman in a patriarchal society. </p>
		<p>The facilitator was sensitive enough to recognise that my silence was also a form of response. His recognition of my silence was an acknowledgement of ‘me’. Awareness and acceptance is the first step toward change and healing. He related to me as a ‘human’ without the prejudices attached to my gender, although we were discussing the highly sensitive issue of gender -based disequilibrium. And this was an externalization of his objective approach. At the same time, his genuine concern and his ability to identify with my experience, not as a ‘man’, but as a ‘human’, was an expression of his subtle subjective involvement. He beautifully managed to strike the precarious balance between objective distance and subjective involvement. </p>
		<p>Finally, his expression was also feedback - of telling me how he felt, and what he thought of my behaviour but without being judgemental. It was a far cry from the general norm of building relationships on preconceived notions and judgements. </p>
		<p>Those words of empathy kindled a spark in me that grew to become a purging fire. It was a deep subconscious learning experience of being genuinely understood and empathised. I was valued for my ‘self’; my opinions and thoughts were appreciated for their intrinsic worth and not measured or judged against the yardstick of socio-cultural norms. </p>
		<p>As students of human behaviour and as practicing clinical psychologists, we are told, time and again, that empathy is a vital skill in counselling; we read plenty of theory in books, and we equip ourselves with the tools and techniques to express empathy. Yet, many of us would not have experienced empathy in our personal lives. No wonder then, that our expression of empathy is only mechanical and not experiential. </p>
		<p>Receiving empathy empowered me to empathise with greater involvement and feeling. I began to relate to my clients on an individual plane; as an individual who relates to the pain of another individual and who is driven to assist in alleviating pain.</p>
		<p>This awareness changed the way I connected with my clients, especially those experiencing marital disharmony. I could relate and empathise with the husband as an individual in the disharmony and not as a woman psychologist talking to the male counterpart of a female client. </p>
		<p>As a follow-up to the workshop, the facilitator and I worked on a few marital disharmony cases, and I noticed the difference in my approach and treatment. I also observed that the clients were more reciprocal and open to change with my renewed position of being EMPATHETIC. </p>
		<p>For those of us working towards empowering another human to deal with crisis situations, striking a balance between being objective about the experiences of our clients and sensitive to their emotional needs, irrespective of all the variable contexts involved, is the greatest challenge. </p>
		<p>In counselling, the emotional resources that you acquire during your interactions with the world are as significant as the intellectual resources gained through academic study. </p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Empathy and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>Expression of empathy is an important technique in psychotherapy and is priceless experiential learning.</p>
			<p>It plays a vital role in establishing rapport between the counsellor and the counselled. Appropriate and timely expression enhances harmony in relationships by mitigating conflicts and arguments. It opens new avenues and facilitates a panoramic view of the situation, and helps formulate a clear plan of action. As a practicing psychologist, you commit to a mental contract to volunteer to participate in your client’s journey of pain and facilitate the alleviation of pain. </p>
			<p>Empathy connects people at a profoundly emotional and experiential level. Empathy is expressed as a response to pain since it is natural for human beings to seek help during a crisis. It  is also expressed during moments of joy. Only, the mode of expression differs. It is usually an overt display of affection such as hugging or holding hands or a firm handshake with a smile to say: I am with you in this happiness. I am as happy as you are. The point of difference is that there is no follow -up action involved.</p>
			<p>I have identified a few parameters involved in the expression of empathy. I exercise these parameters to give the recipient a holistic experience of empathy.</p>
			<p><strong>Refrain from Power Dynamics </strong>- In a therapeutic relationship, steer clear of entering into power dynamics of assuming superiority over your client. A superiority complex would weaken your expression of empathy with a condescending and patronising attitude.</p>
			<p><strong>Refrain from Moralizing </strong>- Refrain form giving behavioural inputs, such as, a list of dos and don’ts that stem from your moral framework.</p>
			<p><strong>Listen Actively </strong>- Listen with keen interest and display appropriate body language. Paraphrase when necessary. Be cued to the client’s subtle emotional responses.</p>
			<p><strong>Value Client Experiences </strong>- Value the experience and the associated emotions as articulated and expressed by the client.</p>
			<p><strong>Understand Context </strong>- Understand the context in which the client has experienced angst or distress.</p>
			<p><strong>Be Mindful </strong>- When the client is sharing, be aware of the emotions and thoughts that are being triggered in you. This will help you get in touch with the client’s feelings and will open new perspectives for your self.</p>
			<p><strong>Summarise </strong>- Summarise the client’s expression in a manner that genuinely expresses trust, hope and concern without judgement or opinion.</p>
			<p><strong>Be alert </strong>- Discern the client’s unexpressed thoughts, ideas and emotions.</p>

			<p>All of us possess the capacity to express empathy. As a therapist, it is essential to utilise your resources and show empathy to your clients in the most efficient manner to enable resolution and recovery.</p>
			<p>The table below distinguishes empathetic from non-empathetic responses through examples. </p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Parameter</th>
					<th>Client Statement</th>
					<th>Empathetic Response</th>
					<th>Non-Empathetic Response</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy is action-oriented.</td>
					<td>Being around her is frustrating. She fights all the time. </td>
					<td>I understand. It must be difficult for you.</td>
					<td>Stay away from her as far as possible. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy focuses on listening</td>
					<td>I am in a fix. I love her. I want to be around her, but I cannot live with her. She irritates me and fights all the time.</td>
					<td>I understand your confusion: you want to be with her but find it frustrating and painful to be with her.</td>
					<td>Why don’t you just decide, this way or that? End the confusion and distress.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Self-reflection as a tool for the client</td>
					<td>She becomes angry whenever my mother visits us. What can I do? My mother is a nice person. You can ask all my friends and their wives too.</td>
					<td>Would you like to understand the dynamics between your mother and your wife?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Self-reflection for self -counsellor/trainer.</td>
					<td>She becomes angry whenever my mother visits us. What can I do? My mother is a nice person. You can ask all my friends and their wives too.</td>
					<td>What is it about these statements that triggers so much anger/angst in me? Let me look at it in my session with my supervisor or reflect on it later.</td>
					<td>Why bother! Let me just complete the session and help the man find a solution.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy uses powerful yet simple words to express the other’s feelings.</td>
					<td>You know, despite her behaviour towards my mother, I helped her mother when she was not well. I took leave from office and did the needful even though she is against my mother. For me, a mother is a mother.</td>
					<td>I appreciate your ability to put aside your anger to help her mother.<br /> I understand your view about love towards mothers.</td>
					<td>Great! You did it because that is YOU.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>The aim is not to be caught in the web of power dynamics.</td>
					<td>Whom do you support? My wife or me?</td>
					<td>In marital counselling, the ‘relationship’ is my primary client and not either of you. I will work on enhancing the quality of the ‘relationship’ because neither of you is right nor wrong. Your interaction is not harmonious, probably because of your expectations and past experiences. I will try to help you understand that and then make choices. I am with you on this journey of struggle.</td>
					<td>I am on nobody’s side. I will try to help both of you.</td>
