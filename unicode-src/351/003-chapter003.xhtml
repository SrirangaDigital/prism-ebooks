		<p class="text-center"><em>‘Trusting you, I also learned to trust myself.’</em></p>
		<p>He sounded distraught. He said, ‘Things have spiralled out of control. I’m not sure I can salvage this institution. I feel responsible for this situation.’</p>
		<p>When I met him, the chairman, of a large and reputed educational institution, I learned that the institution was slowly falling apart. The attrition rate of teachers was at an all-time high. Complaints from parents were pouring in. Parents were seeking appointments with the principal to discuss issues and concerns. His trusted staff had begun to distance themselves. They were not cooperative anymore. All channels of communication had been blocked. </p>
		<p>He said, ‘It has become impossible for me to trust anybody.’ </p>
		<p>All this while, I had only lent a patient ear. </p>
		<p><em>‘Do you think your principal, administrative team, teachers and parents trust you?’ </em>I asked.</p>
		<p>He remained quiet and contemplative for some time. I did not disturb him.</p>
		<p>‘Well. I’m not sure. To be honest, I don’t think they do. I must confess I have been inconsistent in my actions and words.’</p>
		<p>He had transitioned from denial to acceptance. That was a vital first step.</p>
		<p>We planned a series of trust -building strategies with the staff by creating an open and transparent communication environment. We established a system to receive feedback from staff and ensure their proactive participation in troubleshooting.</p>
		<p>Giving staff creative freedom rather than micro managing them; incorporating their ideas and opinions into the system rather than blocking them; listening and not confronting when they voiced challenges or asked for advice; and, making plans flexible rather than enforcing rigid  ones - these were a few active steps taken  to enhance transparency in communication and to initiate a feeling of being respected among the staff. </p>
		<p>Within a quarter, there was a noticeable change in the atmosphere of the institution. Teachers were treated as valuable assets. Teachers communicated and interacted responsibly with parents. They listened to complaints and found solutions without hesitation and fear. Teachers felt involved and valued.</p>
		<p>A series of small changes led to an environment where all felt respected and cared for.</p>
		<p>People occupying leadership positions often experience trust issues with their employees or team members. One of the primary reasons is that they distance themselves from their employees and teams. Leaders forget that it is the entire team that makes the institution run and not just one individual, however powerful or distinguished he may be.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, leaders mistake micro management and control for efficiency and responsibility. In fact, micro management is a sign of mistrust, and many leaders are at risk of adhering to practices, which may lead to trust issues among team members. </p>
		<p>I was scheduled to meet a small corporate team of four members and the team-lead who were working on a critical account. The brief given was that the productivity of the team was deteriorating day by day, even as the release date was approaching. </p>
		<p>My first interaction with the team revealed a lack of transparency among the members. However, when I  talked to each member separately, they were more forthcoming, and a bizarre fact emerged: After every review meeting and goal setting meeting, the team lead would begin to follow the activities of the team members on Facebook, although he was not an avid user of Facebook himself. The team members noticed that he was tracking their every movement and was trying to micromanage them. The team -lead, on the other hand, said, that instead of attending to work, he found his team members on FB all through the day.</p>
		<p>The next session, I invited the team members and the team-lead for a discussion. The session was focused on how people respond to stressful situations. One of the members said, ‘Micromanagement is a clear indication of distrust. Why should I perform?’ </p>
		<p>The team leader was shocked. He realised that he had created an atmosphere of mistrust and had hurt his team in the process. He promised to give his team the necessary space to work. A quarter later, the team was winning accolades for its performance in the company!</p>
		<p>To know that you are trusted is an uplifting experience. It is key to establishing self -esteem and self-confidence. Trust also enhances performance because when you receive trust from a parent, a coach or a boss, it fortifies your own inner strengths. I can say this out of my own personal experience with a senior psychologist with whom I was co-facilitating my first ever Personal Growth Lab. To be paired with a highly acclaimed professional, with over three decades of experience was unnerving enough; and this being a first I was low on confidence too. </p>
		<p>I feared my inexperience would show up. I fretted about little things. Five minutes before the session was to commence, he said, flashing his signature smile, <em> ‘What are your hot and cold tips?’</em></p>
		<p>I was pleasantly surprised. ‘Sir, this is my first session. You are asking me for tips!’</p>
		<p>He said, ‘Why not? Remember, we are both facilitators for this session!’</p>
		<p>That statement was an expression of his trust in my abilities. The implied meaning of the words hit me. He saw me as an equal! The impact of his words was sinking in, when he said, ‘I think you should lead the session.’ To my surprise, he took a back seat, giving me complete freedom to run the session and pitched in only to support.</p>
		<p>While it is an exhilarating feeling to be trusted, to invest trust in another person does not come easily. As much as we would like to believe that we are sensitive and fair, there are ways in which experiences shed light on remote corners of our personality that are still raw. And one such opportunity came during a Personal Growth Lab for facilitators, where a senior staff member and I would discuss and review training sessions conducted by facilitators. Just before we could enter the room, the senior staff asked me,  <em>‘What do you want to enter with?’ </em></p>
		<p>I was surprised because the format of this Personal Growth Lab did not require any aids such as a laptop, PPT, hand-outs, etc. </p>
		<p>I said, ‘Myself.’ </p>
		<p>‘What about yourself?’</p>
		<p>‘My abilities, my willingness ...’</p>
		<p>Was he prompting me to explore something more profound? I wondered. </p>
		<p>After the session, at the end of the day, he said, ‘ <strong>Enter with emptiness</strong>’. Trust the group. Trust the innate human potential to be rational, to strike a balance and create harmony in their lives.’</p>
		<p>Learning to trust another person has a therapeutic impact. It reduces the burden of your own ego. A client recovering from post-natal depression made an insightful remark. She said, ‘Trusting you, I also learned to trust myself. The fact that I trusted you was crucial to my recovery.’ </p>
		<p>Post -natal depression can become traumatic and acute in an environment of family and friends who are neither aware that it is common among most new mothers nor equipped to handle it. My client’s depression worsened when she was accused of ‘being unhappy in the happiest situation of her life’, and her identity was judged against the stereotype of an ‘ideal mother’. Her sister had identified signs of depression and had offered her some tips to deal with it. However, she hadn’t trusted her sister. When her sister noticed that her symptoms were increasing, she advised her to seek professional help. It was not until her gynaecologist insisted that she reluctantly reached out to me. A few sessions in, and she began to trust me as a professional. </p>
		<p>After a few sessions she confessed, ‘My sister is very intuitive and she knows me inside out. She often gives me advice. Sometimes, I accept and follow her advice blindly and sometimes I don’t, depending on my moods. After our sessions,  <em>I have learned that trusting you, I have also learned to trust myself.</em> I have become confident enough to make decisions based on my own judgement.’ </p>
		<p>A mutually trusting family environment is very essential for emotional well -being. The role of the family in fostering mutual trust among members is particularly crucial during teenage. Teenagers crave for independence and freedom and oppose rules and regulations. Parents struggle to deal with the pace of change in their children’s attitudes and behaviours. I often interact with parents to discuss how to build meaningful, less-conflict ridden relationships with the younger generation. During one such facilitated self -help group process, I was assisting parents to help each other through a process of ‘sharing’ - issues they faced in everyday interactions with their teen children and how they resolved them. Topics ranged from changing value systems of the younger generation to behavioural patterns such as argumentativeness and recklessness, apathy to feelings and emotions of adults, etc. One parent talked about how her teenage daughter would end every conversation, which was really an argument, with the standard phrase, ‘You don’t understand’. The parent said she had no idea  <em>what</em> she had to understand. She had noticed this behaviour over the past 2-3 months, and incidentally, during this time, her daughter’s performance in math had deteriorated drastically.</p>
		<p>I explained that this is typically a gap created by a lack of trust. Whenever I discuss trust as a value to be imbibed and expressed, I remember one particular incident that occurred several years ago, which I shared with the group. </p>
		<p>I was at my friend’s house, and her son was manoeuvring the wave board. Observing the ease with which he moved, my friend impulsively said, ‘I want to learn too!’ The boy first explained how the wave board worked. He  held her hand and guided her. He  said, ‘Don’t  be afraid of falling. Just do it.’ He patiently shared the secret of manoeuvring and moving forward. There were a few things that he did very differently from an adult; most importantly, he did not fear that she would fail. He was patient and encouraging. He invested complete trust in her ability. He never got frustrated. Teaching and helping her out was no burden at all, but an experience of great joy.</p>
		<p>She gave it a break and sat down with me. She said, ‘I have so many inhibitions and blocks. Why does learning a new activity cause fear? Why do I resist change? What stops me - past experience or fear of failure? The goal is set. I want to learn. But I just can’t muster enough courage.’</p>
		<p>As an act of supreme will, she acknowledged the possibility of falling and hurting herself, and she went back to trying again. Her son stood next to her and offered his shoulder for support. He shared some tips and secrets, which he had learned the hard way - by falling and hurting himself. He made it easy for his mother. He said, ‘Just concentrate. You can do it.  <em>I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT’</em>.</p>
		<p>What a reversal of roles! I thought. An eight-year-old teaching his mother!</p>
		<p>Although she didn’t master the art of wave boarding that evening, she said, ‘I am pleasantly surprised. His complete trust in me has motivated me. Someday, I will learn to wave board.’</p>
		<p>I quoted this experience to illustrate how an expression of trust helps build confidence and understanding.</p>
		<p>Our perspectives, as adults, are coloured by fear, experience, bias and prejudice. Our ability to extend unconditional trust even to our own children weakens because we become rigid and fail to accept differences. I talked about how the attitudes and perceptions of our children are unlike our own and hence the need to accept and adapt to changes. The fact that children have other ways of doing things has reduced our trust in them. We need to rebuild that trust. This will open up channels for communication, for us to guide them and explain the options/choices before them and the consequences of those choices.</p>
		<p>The mother who had talked about her teen daughter called back to tell me that she had had an open conversation with her daughter, but this time, without blaming her and with complete trust in her abilities. The child opened up and said that the new math teacher’s dominating style didn’t allow students to interact freely and ask questions; besides, he ridiculed children when they asked questions or expressed doubts. That was the real reason for poor math grades. She explained that she felt her parents also did not trust her because they thought that she was lazy and irresponsible. The mother said that she and her husband had become better listeners and had initiated regular, open, non-judgemental conversations so their daughter could share and confide. </p>
		<p>How often do we not approach a task with a whole baggage of biases and preconceived notions that can cloud our vision and interfere with healthy group dynamics? The beauty of emptiness and trust is that it creates a space for assimilation of viewpoints so that viewpoints are not just arrows shot randomly, but transmute to a collective understanding of an underlying principle. </p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Trust and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>You trust a pilot, a complete stranger, to fly you safely. You trust that the rope will not snap when you bungee jump. Trust is the process of breaking mental barriers to establish the credibility of another person. You consult a doctor, probably through a reference for the first time. You implicitly trust the experience of the one who has recommended you. If the doctor can treat you to recovery, you will trust the doctor and continue to consult in the future, and you may also recommend the doctor to others. Trust then works on the premise that  <strong>‘the Person is the Content’</strong>. Eventually, it is not the counsellor’s knowledge or qualifications, but the quality of the client’s personal experience and interaction that builds trust. </p>
			<p>As Monica Davis, Coach, Forbes Coaches Council, says, ‘Trust is an experience. Experiences need to be created by words as well as behaviour. Highly social animals that we are, trust is the fulcrum upon which we build relationships. </p>
			<p>The first interaction of an infant with the mother, as she consistently fulfils the infant’s needs sets the foundation for trust. This experience becomes the basis for establishing trusted social relationships with a variety of people through the different phases of life. </p>
			<p>However, our trust in others and even in our own selves is bound to waver. Thus, begins a journey of trust and distrust with self and others. Words that express trust play a critical role in building or marring a relationship. </p>
			<p><strong>What is the process of building trust? </strong></p>
			<p><strong>Trust building occurs over a period of time.</strong> During this latency period, we oscillate between trust and mistrust, and if the experience is positive, trust is consolidated. It took time for the Trustee of the educational institution to build trust among his staff. The staff had to experience consistent positive behaviour from the trustee, to be able to re -establish their trust in him.</p>
			<p><strong>Trust is a mutual experience.</strong> To gain a person’s trust, you have to trust him in return. The manager in the IT firm had to trust his team members to be capable of responsibly discharging their duties. He, therefore, stopped interfering and gave them freedom of time and space, which gradually re -established the team’s trust in him. The trustee showed his trust in the principal and teachers by making them a part of the decision-making process and incorporating their suggestions. The staff of the institution knew they were being trusted. </p>
			<p><strong>Positive reinforcement is necessary to fortify </strong> <strong>trust.</strong> My mentor’s words, ‘What are your hot and cold tips?’ revealed that he valued my inputs, despite me being a junior. His words, ‘I think you should lead the session,’ was a clear indicator that he trusted my knowledge and skills enough to give me the responsibility to handle the session. The fact that he took a back seat the entire session was an enriching experience of being trusted. Aided by this experience, I shed my inhibitions and self-doubt and conducted the session with confidence and self-esteem. This is precisely the transformative experience my friend underwent with her son when he taught her to wave board. </p>
			<p><strong>Process of Trust Building </strong></p>
			<p>In a therapeutic relationship, mutual trust results in positive outcomes. I approach all training sessions, PGLs, and therapy sessions on a foundation of trust, connecting to the innate nature of human beings and their potential of being rational. The experience of trusting and being trusted gives a sense of freedom; being open -minded and ‘empty’ minded is a great relief! You feel light for you are rid of the burden of being judgemental. </p>

			<p>In a therapeutic interaction, to begin with, clients seek a safe and secure environment in which to discuss their deepest fears, most personal and painful experiences, or even to just be honest, in a non-judgemental environment. A young school going girl had a few cuts on her wrist. The teacher who noticed it demanded to know the reason in front of a full class. She said she cut her hand while removing her glass bangles. Of course, she was lying. The teacher was furious.</p>
			<p>But, what did the teacher expect? That the girl must confide in her? How would she tell the teacher the truth, knowing that she would be quick to judge? Knowing that she would inform her parents? How would she confide some deep pain that found externalization in the act of harming herself to a teacher whom she didn’t trust? The girl needed a safe, secure, non-judgemental environment to confide. In the absence of a trusting environment, clients may withhold information and even lie.</p>
			<p><strong>What are the essentials to establish a trusted relationship?</strong></p>
			<p>Simple steps to create a trusting environment with your client:</p>
			<p><strong>Introduce yourself by your name and not your profession</strong> - Instead of saying: I am a psychologist/counsellor/trainer, you may want to say: I am Shobha, what is your name? I am here to listen to you and help you. What brings you here?</p>
			<p><strong>Listen to your client intently </strong>- The client is looking for signs of trust. Active listening helps your client relate to you and trust you.</p>
			<p><strong>Don’t question, express distrust or show disrespect </strong>- ‘If you want to get to the truth, offer your trust,’ says Adam Kipnes, The 1495 Group. </p>
			<p><strong>Confidentiality is a concern for clients </strong>- Clearly express that all proceedings are confidential: Whatever you say stays in this room, between you and me. If there is a  need to share, I will seek your permission, and I will share with whomsoever you are comfortable with and in your presence only. </p>
			<p><strong>Don’t react but respond </strong>- Refrain from using reactive words and behaviour in response to flaws/mistakes /actions committed. </p>
			<p><strong>Erase guilt in your client </strong>- You may want to say, these things do happen. It’s alright. All of us make mistakes. It’s not your fault that this happened to you. This can be handled and sorted.</p>
			<p><strong>Point towards positive action paths</strong> - Clients want to know if there is a way out of the problems they are facing but they are not ready for a ‘to do’ list. </p>
			<p><strong>Reassure </strong>- As the session progresses, express confidence in their competence. Provide positive reinforcement for accomplished tasks. Encourage and give constructive feedback. Move from simple to complex tasks. This shows that you trust their ability, but at the same time, you are building their trust in themselves for positive outcomes.</p>
			<p><strong>Ask questions, don’t give answers </strong>- Enable and empower them to find answers to questions and solutions to problems. Do not offer ready-made answers.</p>

			<p><strong>Cliche phrases </strong>can often make a difference.</p>
			<p>As Ernest Hemingway said, ‘The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.’</p>

			<p>Every relationship is built on the premise of trust, be it parent-child, marital or even a therapeutic relationship. Mutual trust is a powerful experience but needs simple words to express and experience. </p>
