		<p><em>Poorna is one of the most amazing people I have met in three years in India. She illustrates the power of womenâ€™s leadership among her generation, and she is an inspiration to women and girls across India and the world. I am delighted that she will be headed to the United States as an exchange participant through one of our State Departmentfunded programs. We will be proud to welcome Poorna to the United States, to share her experiences as a climber, a learner, and as a leader</em></p>
