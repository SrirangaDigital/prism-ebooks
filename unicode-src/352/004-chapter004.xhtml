<p><strong>26 October 2013<br />6.00 pm<br />Secunderabad Railway Station</strong></p>
<p><span class="big-letter">E</span>xcitement was palpable among the nineteen children travelling to Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI). One more boy, Praveen Kumar, would join them at Vishakapatnam. The children looked smart in their sports uniform, with ‘Social Welfare Residential School’ printed on the back of their t-shirts. Their excitement peaked when the train whistled and began to move slowly. For most of them, this was their first ever train journey. Their nervous excitement was uncontainable. A few, for whom this was not the first, bossed over the novices. Some suppressed their excitement to look cool. However, for everyone, this was the first journey across the State borders. The  train chugged along, drowning the buzz of chatter.</p>
<p>The children were travelling by sleeper class to New Jalpaiguri Railway Station junction from where they would be driven to HMI in Darjeeling. They were scheduled to reach the station in thirty-six hours, i.e., next evening.</p>
<p>Parmesh scanned the entire compartment to ensure everything was in order. He was quite satisfied: students were comfortable; the luggage was tucked below the berths; there was enough food for breakfast and lunch; above all, the children were in good spirit.</p>
<p>He took attendance, and this was the third time; the first at Secunderabad railway station platform; and, second, before the train started: Poorna, Roja, Bharathi, Deevena, Abhilasha, Saika Krishnaveni, Ramalakshmi, Sarita, Ravali, Rupa, Anand, Gangadhar, Satya Rao, Madhukar, Anjani Prasad, Mohan Prasad, Nagaraju, Srikumar, Shyam Prasad. Once Praveen Kumar joined them at Vishakhapatnam, they would be ten girls and ten boys. </p>
<p><em>Aghh...twenty adolescents and three of us! </em></p>
<p>The thought rooted itself in Parmesh’s mind. He looked nervously at Surekha, the PET teacher. She returned a reassuring smile. She was well-acquainted with the children, as she had worked with them for a whole month. The fact that she taught at one of the Social Welfare Residential Schools was an added advantage. Anil, Paramesh’s assistant, accompanied them. </p>
<p>The engine was replaced at the Khajipet station. After breakfast, the children played  <em>antyakshari</em>. The train resumed after a twenty-minute halt. A quarter of an hour passed. Parmesh began to feel anxious. It took a couple of minutes for him to figure out what was bothering him. Then it hit him. The train that was supposed to make a right turn at Khajipet had taken a left turn. He enquired with his fellow passengers. They had no clue. He rushed to the TTE. </p>
<p>‘We had to change the route. The cyclone has hit Odisha. Two bridges have collapsed at Srikakulam.  <strong>So we have taken a detour</strong>.’</p>
<p><em>Oh! Praveen Kumar. How will he reach the camp? We are not even going via Vishakapatnam!</em></p>
<p>He called Sekhar Babu to brief him of this unexpected development. Sekhar Babu assured that he would help Praveen reach Darjeeling. By evening, after much anxiety, Parmesh learnt that the train was redirected via Khajipet-Karimnagar-Nagpur-Madhya Pradesh-New Jalpaiguri instead of the regular Khajipet-Vijaywada-Vishakhapatnam-Bhuvaneswar-Kolkata-New Jalpaiguri route. Since the train was unscheduled, it was accommodated between two other trains at every station. Paramesh could not reach the platform to buy food for the children. He managed to pick up whatever little he could within the limited time to keep hunger at bay. </p>
<p>The train reached New Jalpaiguri after fifty-six hours! Although it was evening, the sun was still blazing, and the heat hit them in the face. Sekhar Babu had arranged taxis for the journey to Darjeeling. Parmesh instructed the students to keep their jackets handy before boarding the taxi. The children were puzzled. The temperature was higher than in Hyderabad for that hour. They reached Darjeeling after a three and a half hour drive, at 7.30 pm.</p>
<p>The children were rushed into their rooms. Despite wearing jackets, their teeth chattered, and hands shivered. They were in a sub-zero temperature zone for the first time in their lives. They quickly freshened up and assembled for dinner, eager to snuggle back into the warm comforters. </p>
<p>Parmesh read out the schedule for the next day at the dining table. Since HMI does not entertain foster care, Parmesh, Anil and Surekha had also enrolled themselves into the program so they could watch over the children. </p>
<p><strong>28 October 2013<br />5.45 am<br />HMI Ground</strong></p>
<p>The children gathered at the practice ground for their workout. The morning fog was still dense. The temperature was as low as 6˚c. Despite the long journey and sudden shift in weather conditions, the children had managed to beat fatigue to assemble at the practice ground on time. </p>
<p>Parmesh beamed with pride. </p>
<p>He had conducted training for thousands of children.</p>
<p><em>These children are different. They have fire in their belly. These are not the spoilt brats coming out of incubation chambers. Education is a luxury for these children, </em>he thought.</p>
<p>The junior instructor arrived first and took attendance. The senior instructor arrived at 6 am. </p>
<p>‘These children...??!!’ He said with surprise and disbelief.</p>
<p>He went through the chart and looked at them again. Turning toward Parmesh, he said, ‘These children are too young. How can we train them? We have never trained such young ones.’</p>
<p>‘But, this is a special course. We have written approval. Praveen Kumar Sir has already taken the necessary permission. He has also spoken to Captain Samuel.’ </p>
<p>Captain Samuel Larlintunga is the officiating principal of HMI.</p>
<p>‘Maybe. But the minimum qualifying age for this program, after all concessions, is seventeen. How can we accept children below fifteen years?’ </p>
<p><em>‘Yeh toh chote bacche hain bhai</em>! (These are small children!) Below fifteen years, we are stretching this too far!’</p>
<p>Parmesh checked the chart. He knew that all the children were under seventeen. But he did not expect some of them to be as young as thirteen! ‘Sir, but we  <em>have </em>permission ...’</p>
<p>The senior instructor thought for a few seconds.</p>
<p>‘<em>Accha. Pehle inko running ke liye le jaavo</em>…’ (Ok, first take them out for a run.)</p>
