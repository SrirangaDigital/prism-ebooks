		<p>To close the gap between ``ideal'' me and ``real'' me, I must be physically healthy, emotionally balanced, mentally stable, intellectually sharp and spiritually connected.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/002.jpg" alt="fig2" />
		</figure>
		<p>Health is our birthright and we have lost it in pursuit of fleeting things in life. Each one of us possess divine qualities such as contentment, bliss, joy, generosity, compassion, fearlessness etc. When we calm our mind by meditating upon on the permanent, unchangeable and sacred, these hidden divine qualities start manifesting in us. When this happens, one becomes healthy from within. This health is contagious and can bring in the revolution within and outside.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/003.jpg" alt="fig3" />
		</figure>
		<p>For addressing mental health, we should first understand where our mind is. Mind is not in the brain, but it is in the heart. The scriptures say that unless we are connected within there will be neither peace nor happiness.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/004.jpg" alt="fig4" />
		</figure>
		<p>Heart is the source of our inspiration, delight, bliss and joy. We want to be happy, but we are seeking it in the wrong place. Bliss, joy, contentment and happiness are everyoneâ€™s birth right. Spiritual strength is the highest strength and is far superior to physical or monetary strength.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/005.jpg" alt="fig5" />
		</figure>
		<p>The Surface of the ocean is always rough, and we see waves after waves. But deep beneath the ocean there is tranquillity and stillness. Similarly, our outer life is nothing but a series of problems, stress and anxiety. But when we go deep within, we discover peace, tranquillity, stillness, happiness and joy. These are the inexhaustible wealth within.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/006.jpg" alt="fig6" />
		</figure>
		<p>The healing should start from within. When we are spiritually enlivened, droopy mind gets charged and becomes positive. When this happens, one feels an exuberance of energy and all 37.2 trillion cells in the body gets charged up and one undoubtedly will accomplish unimaginable things in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/007.jpg" alt="fig7" />

		<p>You are a traveller and you have a long distance to cover and this body is the vehicle. Look after this vehicle so that your journey is smooth till the end. Live long with good health and may this vehicle be of use to you and to others. Yoga helps in achieving this.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/008.jpg" alt="fig8" />
		</figure>
		<p>Moving from <strong>I</strong> to <strong>We</strong> is moving from illness to Wellness. When we live for others, we will experience abundance of energy and joy within.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/009.jpg" alt="fig9" />
		</figure>
		<p>Compassion and humility are the tolls we can give to the creator for allowing us to use the space here.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/010.jpg" alt="fig10" />
		</figure>
		<p>Just like a boat has to untie the anchor from this shore to reach the other shore, we must develop vairagya (detachment to trivial things in life) to achieve greater heights in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/011.jpg" alt="fig11" />
		</figure>
		<p>When a boat leaves from one shore to the other, some feel distressed and depressed to leave the known territory while some feel anxious and restless about their new life, but a rare few will enjoy the boat journey. To overcome the depression and anxiety we must learn to live in the present so that we will enjoy the life's journey.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/012.jpg" alt="fig12" />
		</figure>
		<p>Our brand value will not go up by wearing branded cloths or shoes or having branded products. Our brand image will go up only by value-based life. We must enrich our lives in such a way that we add value to others.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/013.jpg" alt="fig13" />
		</figure>
		<p>As a baby we spend most of our time lying down and as an elderly person we spend most of the time lying down. In between we must make use of our vertebral column and learn to sit and meditate on greater ideals in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/014.jpg" alt="fig14" />
		</figure>
		<p>Mind is like a lake. In a disturbed mind, like a lake which looks very muddy on a rainy day, we cannot think properly. Just like when the mud gets settled, we can see the bottom of the lake, regular practice of meditation helps in clarity of thinking.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/015.jpg" alt="fig15" />
		</figure>
		<p>In a water treatment plant, a coagulant is used to settle the suspended solids. For our mind a mantra - a divine name is the coagulant which helps in settling the disturbing thoughts.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/016.jpg" alt="fig16" />
		</figure>
		<p>In an electric motor when the current is passed to the stator, the rotor picks up the energy and starts rotating. Similarly one picks up immense energy from within when one is connected to the source of all energies, in dweller of all - the Supreme Lord.</p>
		<figure>

		<p>Brahmi muhurta starts 96 minutes before the sun rise and ends 48 minutes before the sun rise. 96 minutes before the Brahmi muhurta is called Vishnu muhurta. During this period nature is at peak stillness and is filled with pranic energy. Utilise this period for your inner journey. This is the secret of success in yoga.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/020.jpg" alt="fig20" />
		</figure>
		<p>Make sure that your life is of use to others. By living for others, immense divine energy starts flowing through you and that will help you in reaching greater heights in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/021.jpg" alt="fig21" />
		</figure>
		<p>You are what you think. Think always good and positive, your life undoubtedly will be noble and brilliant.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/022.jpg" alt="fig22" />
		</figure>
		<p>Always have a smile on your face irrespective of the situation. Looking at your happy face others' burden melts down. Having a smile on the face all the time is a mark of a divine quality.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/023.jpg" alt="fig23" />

		<p>In the aeroplane they announce that in case of emergency put on the oxygen mask on to yourself before helping others to avoid two casualties. Similarly, unless we look after ourselves, we cannot add value to others.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/024.jpg" alt="fig24" />
		</figure>
		<p>Individual health contributes to family health. Family health contributes to community health. Community health contributes to nation's health. Nation's health contributes to the world health. World health must dawn from within.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="fig25" />
		</figure>
		<p>Success in life is measured by the knowledge we acquired, actions we performed and how well we inspired others to excel. Without tapas (austerity) these three are not possible.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/026.jpg" alt="fig26" />
		</figure>
		<p>Like we control the horse by its reigns, we can control our mind by breath. By having control over the breath, we can manage our emotions well. Pranayama is the secret to a healthy mind.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/027.jpg" alt="fig27" />
		</figure>
		<p>The seven chakras in the body are like the seven strings in the veena, the musical instrument. We can hear the resonance from each chakra when the chakras are purified and aligned. When this happens, one experiences immense bliss within.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/028.jpg" alt="fig28" />

		<p>Like a magnet attracts iron, Lord Shri Krishna attracts all with noble qualities. ``Krishna'' means one who is most attractive. Lord Shri Krishna is not only an inspiration for children, youths, adults and old people but also for greatest of the seers. Our salutations to Lord Shri Krishna who is the universal eternal teacher - Krishnam vande jagadgurum.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/031.jpg" alt="fig31" />
		</figure>
		<p>Our life is like gold ore which has about 5 grams of gold per ton and goes unnoticed because we lead a life without any noble aspirations and goals. When we enrich our life by entertaining higher ideals in life, our value goes up as we add value to other's lives</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/032.jpg" alt="fig32" />
		</figure>
		<p>You are a bundle of body, mind and soul and you are your only lifelong companion. Yoga is the road map to the ultimate destination... use it.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/033.jpg" alt="fig33" />
		</figure>
		<p>A resistance to flow of liquid is called as viscosity. A resistance to flow of electricity is called as ohm. A resistance to flow of thoughts is called as stress. Mental stress is more harmful than the physical stress. Yoga helps in managing the stress at all levels.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/034.jpg" alt="fig34" />
		</figure>
		<p>If we try to handle a situation standing on a shaky foundation, our life will be filled with stress and anxiety. On the other hand, by looking and establishing within oneself, one can handle multiple problems simultaneously without getting stressed.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/035.jpg" alt="fig35" />
		</figure>
		<p>Be creative and be original. Imitation cannot be compared to the original. Imitation leads to bondage, while being creative and original liberates us from stress and anxiety.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/036.jpg" alt="fig36" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/037.jpg" alt="fig37" />
		</figure>
		<p>When we think negative, more and more negative forces start taking shelter in us and take us further low in life. On the other token when we think good, noble, pure and auspicious, we will get divine protection and we move upward in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/038.jpg" alt="fig38" />
		</figure>
		<p>Like trees in winter shed off leaves to conserve energy, in our difficult times our near and dear ones move away and force us to withdraw to contemplate and conserve energy. Like trees in spring with full of new branches and flowers, we also will spring out with invigorated energy when the difficult time passes.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/039.jpg" alt="fig39" />
		</figure>
		<p>Ekadanta means those with single pointed noble goal in life will overcome all negativities and obstacles (vakratunda) and will realise the highest (danti prachodayat). When this happens, they will get immense joy (modaka) in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/040.jpg" alt="fig40" />
		</figure>
		<p>A yogi knows that the goal of life is so big that cannot be reached with a time bound effort. With a time bound effort, the fruit also is time bound. But with the effort which is not bound by time, one will reap unbound fruits -- lasting happiness. Those who have this type of commitment will become great leaders and will nourish the community for years.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/041.jpg" alt="fig41" />
		</figure>
		<p>Like in a house all cables run through a conduit pipe, in this body all the nerves to the brain run through the conduit pipe called as spine. We must keep this spine strong and flexible to have a healthy brain. Asanas help in keeping the spine healthy.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/042.jpg" alt="fig42" />
		</figure>
		<p>As we age, our muscles and tissues become hard and restrict our movement. This leads to muscle pain and cramps. Asanas help in uplifting our energy by making our muscles and tissues strong and elastic.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/043.jpg" alt="fig43" />
		</figure>
		<p>Be mindful of what you eat, who has cooked the food, who is providing the food, where, when and how you are eating. This will have direct impact on your health.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/044.jpg" alt="fig44" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/045.jpg" alt="fig45" />
		</figure>
		<p>To have respect in the society always give more than what you take. The moment we start drawing more than what we give, we lose respect and people will not appreciate our presence.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/046.jpg" alt="fig46" />
		</figure>
		<p>Like all 37.2 trillion cells in the body are equally dear to us, every soul in the universe is dear to the Lord. Serving and respecting all is the best service to the Lord who dwells in all beings.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/047.jpg" alt="fig47" />
		</figure>
		<p>All animals endear life. They like their parents, siblings and babies. We have no right to steal their right to live to satiate our taste buds.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/048.jpg" alt="fig48" />
		</figure>
		<p>Before an animal is slaughtered its adrenal gland gets pumped up and secretes stress, fear, anger and anxiety hormones. People become restless with increased stress, anxiety, fear and anger when they eat meat as these hormones affect their psychology. Food we eat impacts our mind and body. Be mindful of what you eat.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/049.jpg" alt="fig49" />
		</figure>
		<p>Flowers in the forest bloom and wither away quietly leaving the fragrance behind. Likewise, our life also should be of least disturbance and we must depart quietly leaving an inspired generation behind.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/050.jpg" alt="fig50" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/051.jpg" alt="fig51" />
		</figure>
		<p>The mental status just before death is dependent of the values we entertain throughout our life. Seeing how a person had died we can ascertain how one had lived his life.</p> 
		<figure>
			<img src="images/052.jpg" alt="fig52" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/053.jpg" alt="fig53" />
		</figure>
		<p>A tree, to grow big and to stand the test of time in all climatic conditions, must have strong roots. To have strong roots, it must blend well with the soil to allow the nutrients to flow through so that the tree flourishes. Similarly, for us to flourish well in life we need to connect well to the inner light with strong roots.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/054.jpg" alt="fig54" />
		</figure>
		<p>The spinal column is like a distillation column in an oil refinery. The chakras along the spinal column are the tapping points for expressing various emotions. As the energy transcends higher, finer emotions are expressed.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/055.jpg" alt="fig55" />
		</figure>
		<p>Chakra means wheel. Like a wheel spinning in the same place, we get caught up in the same energy. It requires an immense individual effort and proper guidance to pierce the chakra to transcend higher.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/056.jpg" alt="fig56" />
		</figure>
		<p>At the traffic intersection because of built up traffic, vehicles move very slowly, and the traffic jam is eased by opening additional lanes. Similarly, because of congruence of nadis, the energy gets built up in chakras. As we transcend higher along the spine, additional petals gets opened in chakras to ease the flow of energy. This is called as blossoming of personality.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/057.jpg" alt="fig57" />
		</figure>
		<p>Religion focuses on process and spirituality focuses on content. A process without content is useless and content without a proper process will lead one astray. We need a balanced process and content so that our inner blossoming happens naturally.</p> 
		<figure>
			<img src="images/058.jpg" alt="fig58" />
		</figure>
		<p>Crude oil has limited utility. However, when it is refined, many streams such as fuel oil, lubricants, diesel, kerosene, gasoline etc., come out. Similarly, the dormant energy in us is of limited utility. But when it is awakened and refined through sadhana, beautiful human qualities such as compassion, humility, joy, devotion, knowledge, fearlessness, generosity, bliss etc, are expressed. This is called as awakening of kundalini.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/059.jpg" alt="fig59" />
		</figure>
		<p>``Kunda'' means fire pit. Kundalini means a dormant energy in the fire pit. Like a crude oil is refined by applying heat and pressure, awaken the dormant energy through tapas. This must be done with the guidance of a competent teacher with an intention to realise the highest.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/060.jpg" alt="fig60" />
		</figure>
		<p>We can exist without our family and friends, but we cannot exist without ourselves. Family and friends are the branches and we are the root in this tree of life. Through yoga practice strengthen the roots so that this tree can support friends, family and community better.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/061.jpg" alt="fig61" />
		</figure>
		<p>We go through three phases everyday -- wakeful, dream and deep sleep. We have no choice in selecting the type of dream we want to see. We cannot choose at what time and when we will go into deep sleep. Then there is no point in getting upset over things which do not go the way we want in the wakeful state. Yoga dawns in that person who has realised this.</p> 
		<figure>
			<img src="images/062.jpg" alt="fig62" />
		</figure>
		<p>We cannot establish in a higher chakra unless we lived well through in the preceding chakras. Temporarily we may ascend to higher chakras without stabilising the preceding chakras, but we will fall back to the chakra where it requires stabilising.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/063.jpg" alt="fig63" />
		</figure>
		<p>In the war front a white flag indicates truce and peace. As we grow older our hair becomes grey to indicate that we must make truce and find peace in the battle of this life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/064.jpg" alt="fig64" />
		</figure>
		<p>The core message of all religions is peace. Religion is a tool to find inner peace. Misunderstanding a religion can be an obstacle to inner and outer peace.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/065.jpg" alt="fig65" />
		</figure>
		<p>Yoga urges us to be brave to pick up the right tool to find inner peace. Be courageous to discard the obstacles to peace. Do not get swayed by popular beliefs. The purpose of this life is to acquire unshakable peace and it is our birth right.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/066.jpg" alt="fig66" />
		</figure>
		<p>Peace does not dawn by mere slogans and chanting. When one gets rooted well within, one gets connected well with others. We are no superior or inferior than the co-travellers and every human should reach out to others to make this planet a better place.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/067.jpg" alt="fig67" />
		</figure>
		<p>We cannot find peace in life without attaching the mind to the most peaceful, most complete and most perfect -- God. Scriptures call Him as ``Shantakaram'' an embodiment of Peace and Bliss.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/068.jpg" alt="fig68" />
		</figure>
		<p>Money is a mere tool in life and should not become the goal of life. When one's goal of life becomes only making money by any means, one loses inner peace.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/069.jpg" alt="fig69" />
		</figure>
		<p>Taking the money out of equation, we all must find out what inspires our life. This will be the path to our inner personality expansion leading to immense joy in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/070.jpg" alt="fig70" />
		</figure>
		<p>Our standard of living cannot be improved by merely raising the height of the roof or by adding additional lanes to the road. Without a value driven life, outer changes will not improve the quality of our life. Yoga helps in improving our standard of living.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/071.jpg" alt="fig71" />
		</figure>
		<p>Like the stagnant water gets putrefied, hoarded money stinks and becomes a burden for the hoarder and the society. Like the flowing water remains fresh, a magnanimous person remains fresh and radiates peace.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/072.jpg" alt="fig72" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/073.jpg" alt="fig73" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/074.jpg" alt="fig74" />
		</figure>
		<p>Giving does not mean only giving material things. A person without money also can be generous. Giving personal time, good thoughts and words are also considered as charity.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/075.jpg" alt="fig75" />
		</figure>
		<p>Live in life such a way that you be an inspiration for others for generations to come. Read about the lives of great people to get inspired to lead a noble life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/076.jpg" alt="fig76" />
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/077.jpg" alt="fig77" />
		</figure>
		<p>A weak person cannot achieve great things in life. Through asana strengthen the body. Through pranayama strengthen the nerves. Through meditation clarify the mind. Visualise the goal of life and stop not till you reach it. This is the secret of success.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/078.jpg" alt="fig78" />
		</figure>
		<p>Om is a mono syllable and is the seed of all mantras. Om sanctifies all mantras and therefore all mantras start with Om. The resonance of Om pervades everywhere, and it can be heard clearly within in meditation.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/079.jpg" alt="fig79" />
		</figure>
		<p>Mantra is a formula for resolving the problems in life. Mantra is positive affirmation impregnated with deeper meaning. Repeating a sacred mantra with great reverence for a length of time, the inner meaning gets revealed and the spiritual energy gets awakened. When this happens, one experiences an exuberance of energy and accomplishes marvellous things in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/080.jpg" alt="fig80" />
		</figure>
		<p>Repeating a divine mantra for a length of time changes the default settings of the mind. Instead of going back to negative and trivial things, the default setting of the mind is changed to divine and positive things in life. When this happens, a seeker is said to be in the path of light.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/081.jpg" alt="fig81" />
		</figure>
		<p>Much higher than the physical power is spiritual power. Spiritual strength is far greater than the physical strength. Invest your time to acquire the spiritual strength which will protect you from all perils in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/082.jpg" alt="fig82" />
		</figure>
		<p>Every country has its core competency. India's core competency is its spiritual strength which sustains and nourishes the whole world. If India loses its spiritual strength, it will lose its identity. But, India is protected by spiritual energy of countless spiritual masters for thousands of years.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/083.jpg" alt="fig83" />
		</figure>
		<p>Just like fire comes out by rubbing two pieces of wood, repeating the divine mantra with reverence for a length of time, one experiences the inner light which destroys darkness in life. When the spiritual energy is awakened this way, one radiates peace.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/084.jpg" alt="fig84" />
		</figure>
		<p>A Religion is like a highway and truth cannot be found on the highway. At certain point, one must get off the highway and enter the by lane to find out the truth all alone. To get on to the by lane and seek the truth one requires tremendous courage and will power.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/085.jpg" alt="fig85" />
		</figure>
		<p>A Guru is the one who brings meaning to our life. A Guru is the one who shows the path to our inner journey. A Guru is the one who connects us to the Divine within. A Guru is the one who helps us to lead a divine life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/086.jpg" alt="fig86" />
		</figure>
		<p>Yoga has four faces -- karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga and raja yoga. All four yogas are complimentary to each other and we need all four yogas to excel in life. For example, in an exam, writing the answer is karma yoga, submitting the paper is bhakti yoga, writing the relevant answer is jnana yoga, writing during the allocated time is raja yoga. To pass the exam we need all four dimensions of yoga.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/087.jpg" alt="fig87" />
		</figure>
		<p>To be able to do karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga and raja yoga one must be physically healthy, mentally balanced, emotionally stable and intellectually sharp. Hata yoga prepares and takes us to the portals of yoga.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/088.jpg" alt="fig88" />
		</figure>
		<p>Hata yoga means balancing emotional and intellectual personality. Hata yoga means balancing the masculine and feminine personality in us. Hata yoga means balancing the sun and moon system in us. Hata yoga means balancing the heating and cooling system in us. Hata yoga means a determined effort to succeed in life.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/089.jpg" alt="fig89" />

		<p>This body is compared to a tree with roots up and branches flowing down. Before this tree falls it must yield fruits which are of use for oneself and other co-travellers. If this tree just occupies space and consumes the nutrients without yielding any fruits, then this tree is called as a barren tree.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/090.jpg" alt="fig90" />
		</figure>
		<p>Rivers never flow straight. Its path is windy. It is saying that life is not always straight or black and white. We should be able to adapt to the situation to reach the goal. Skill in action is Yoga.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/091.jpg" alt="fig91" />
		</figure>
		<p><strong>Karma</strong> opens in four ways: akarma, vikarma, sakama karma and nishkama karma. We can understand these by this example:</p>
		<p><strong>Akarma</strong> means neither interested to work nor interested in the remuneration.</p>
		<p><strong>Vikarma</strong> means not interested to work but wants remuneration.</p>
		<p><strong>Sakama</strong> karma means effort is proportional to the remuneration.</p>
		<p><strong>Nishkama karma</strong> means remuneration is not the driver to work and work is an expression of joy.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/092.jpg" alt="fig92" />
		</figure>
		<p>Only action with nishkama karma (action not attached to result) attitude liberates the person and other type of actions like sakama karma (selfish desire prompted action), vikarma karma (wrong action) and akarma karma (inaction) binds and makes a person helpless.</p>
		<figure>

		<p>When action is performed with knowledge it unfolds as <strong>nishkama karma</strong> (action not attached to result) which is nothing but <strong>karma yoga</strong>. When this happens the best in oneself comes out and this is the secret of success in life.</p>

		<p>Everyone must do community service as an offering to the Supreme Lord. What we are is because of the society and we must give it back more than what we have taken. Then only the society thrives. One who always takes from the society and never gives back is called a thief by Lord Shri Krishna.</p>

		<p>Inlight, enlight and delight. We must be in light to get enlightened to the real bliss within.</p>

		<p>Knowledge is light while ignorance is darkness. Knowledge liberates us while ignorance binds us. Knowledge makes us fearless while ignorance brings in stress and anxiety. Knowledge brings in humility while ignorance brings in arrogance. Knowledge brings in respect while an ignorant person gets ignored.</p>

		<p>Information is not knowledge. When information is synthesised through thorough analysis and when unwanted husks and fillings are removed through deep contemplation, the knowledge dawns. Information is gathered from outside while the knowledge is dawned from within.</p>

		<p>Information without knowledge is a liability. While the knowledge is your inexhaustible asset and its value never gets depreciated.</p>

		<p>A wealthy person may be disowned by own children while the whole society will look after a person with knowledge. When one who dedicates his life to serve the society as a service to Lord, Lord takes upon the responsibility of looking after the welfare of his devotee.</p>

		<p>The highest of the knowledge is knowledge of the seed from which the whole tree of creation has come about. One who realises this metaphysical science will understand the material science easily.</p>

		<p>Devotion to knowledge and dispassion to information is the foundation of sadhana. Devotion (bhakti) enhances knowledge (jnana). When devotion to knowledge happens, dispassion (vairagya) to information happens naturally.</p>

		<p>If you want to move upward in the tree of life, you must go inward to strengthen and enrich the roots. Without an inward journey one will not have a sustained upward journey.</p>

		<p>Desire to cling on to life is inherent to all living beings. Denying this right to live and using their meat to satisfy our tongue is a great injustice to life and one will have to pay a toll for this karma.</p>

		<p>We are travellers in this planet, and we must leave this place in a better condition than we got. Earth, water, fire, air and space are given so that our journey is pleasant. All living beings are stake holders of these gross elements and we humans must realise this and use these resources with utmost care.</p>

		<p>The core of the earth has fire and the oil beneath the surface is the fuel for that fire. Because of our economic greed if we empty the oil beneath the surface, fire will come out to engulf the world.</p>

		<p>Be mindful before throwing things away as they may come back to your life. Minimise waste and recycle as much as you can. Reduce your carbon footprint so that our next generation have better life than us.</p>

		<p>The magnetic energy moves from south pole to north. While sleeping do not put your head facing the north as the low energy from your feet will move towards your head and this may impact the quality of sleep.</p>

		<p>When an individual is at peace, family is at peace. When the family is at peace the community is at peace. When the community is at peace, the nation at peace. When the nation is at peace, world is at peace. World peace must dawn from within.</p>
