		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Foreword</h1>
		<p>I met dear Rajendra in Ganesh Hindu temple in Adelaide, Australia. It was the year 2000 and I was sent to Australia by Param Pujya Guru Maharaj Swami Chidanandaji. Rajendra attended Bhagawat Gita talks that I was giving in the temple and we instantly connected and became friends. </p>
		<p>Later he moved to Melbourne and there he gradually took charge of organizing my yearly programs. In 2008 while in Melbourne, I had a stroke and spent a month in a local hospital. Rajendra with his practical Yoga students, was quick to give me all the loving care and support that greatly helped my recovery. God bless dear Rajendra, his family and his extended Yogic family. </p>
		<p>Staying with him and being part of his family every year during Australian winter, I was able to observe his day-to-day life. Rajendra is a Chemical Engineer, has a job and is a family man but nevertheless, he never misses his Sandhyavandana, morning and evening, with his dear son Amrut. “Teach by being, Learn by doing” is his motto. </p>
		<p>Yogic spiritual life is 1&#37; inspiration and 99&#37; perspiration. My Dear Blessed Divinity, this wonderful book is in your hands now and it will change your life forever. This is a guidebook for inner journey. Make a strong resolution that from now on you are going to give time to yourself morning and evening for your inner journey. Your inspiration and strength will come from the Yogic truth, that divinity is hidden inside you. Every soul is in search of eternal happiness. However, the limited material world can give only what it has, namely limited happiness. Only that which is eternal gives eternal bliss. Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from pain. This Yoga should be practiced with determination. God’s and Guru’s blessings will merge with your inner determination. Make your life sublime like dear Rajendra shows in this wonderful book ”VASUDEVA KRIYA YOGA”.</p>
