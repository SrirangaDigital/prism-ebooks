		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Things to Know about Yoga</h1>
		<p class="myquote">Yoga means different things to different people. Some schools focus on only body workouts, while some Vedanta schools talk only about intellectually oriented ideas. But we do need a strong body and a sharp mind, so that we not only have well developed personality but also a fit mind for appropriate sadhana. If one uses only the mind, the body becomes weak. On the other hand, if one uses only the body, then the mind becomes weak.</p>
		<p>In <em>Mahabharata </em>(the Great Indian epic), after the conclusion of war, King Dharmaraja (eldest of the <em>Pandava </em>brothers) goes into depression wanting to relinquish the kingdom and retreat to the forest for penance. But his brother Bhimasena chides him saying that, Dharmaraja’s mind has become rustic and impractical, like the one who studies and chants Veda all the time without understanding its meaning. </p>
		<p><em>Acharya Madwa</em>(13th century), propounder of the School of <em>Tatvavada</em>, taught not only<em>Vedanta</em> (the Vedic Philosophy) to his disciples, but also taught them wrestling, demonstrating the importance of both body and mind. History says that there was a very huge statue of Lord Shri Krishna in Brindavan made of diamonds and precious gems. When Ghazni Mohammed destroyed that statue and took all the diamonds on the backs of elephants and camels, Krishna’s devotees were praying and thinking that the Lord would come to rescue himself. This attitude continued for centuries during which many invaders came, including the Moguls and British, who ruled and pilfered the precious resources of India.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Definitions of Yoga </h2>
			<p>Yoga means <em>upaya </em>(solution) for reaching the highest. Shri Veda Vyasa defines  the meaning of Yoga in the <em>Vishnu Purana </em>as <em>Tasyah Brahmani Samyogaha yoga ityabidhiyate </em>— Joining our self with the Lord is Yoga or tuning one self to the will of the Lord is Yoga. The <em>Bhagawat Gita </em>(Song of the Lord) is the main text of yoga. The Bhagawat Gita makes us excel in life by giving us psychotherapy. Our personality is dependent on our mind. If the mind is elevated, any physical discomfort does not worry us. On the other hand, if the mind is not elevated,  however affluent we are, even a small problem can disturb us. Bhagawat Gita trains us how to elevate the mind so that problems do not disturb us. Bhagawat Gita has 700 <em>slokas</em> (verses) contained in 18 chapters, with each chapter explaining different dimensions of yoga. Out of 700 shlokas, 574 shlokas are spoken by Lord Shri Krishna, 84 by Arjuna, 41 by Sanjaya and 1 by Dhritarastra. Many shlokas of Bhagawat Gita are very uplifting and elevating. One of the examples is in the 11th chapter —<em>Viswarupa Dharshana </em>(vision of the Divine):</p>
			<p class="verse"><em>tasmat-tvam-uttisttha yasho labhasva</em><br /><em>jitva-shatrun-bhunksva rajyam samrdham</em><br /> <em>mayaivaite-nihatah-purvam eva-</em><br /> <em>nimitta matram bhava savyasaachin</em></p>
			<p class="verse-author">B.G. 11.33</p>
			<p>‘O <em>Savyasachi </em>(ambitious person), get up, and attain glory and enjoy this prosperous world. I have already removed the obstacles for you and you are a mere instrument in my hands.’ </p>
			<p> The name Yoga comes from the Sanskrit root word <em>Yuj</em>meaning joining. Bringing <em>Jivatma</em>(lower self) to <em>Paramatma</em>(higher self) is Yoga. Shrimad Bhagawat Gita is an authoritative text in Yoga wherein</p>
			<p>Shri Krishna defines Yoga as: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>1.&#9;Yogah Karmasu Khoushalam — Skill in action is Yoga</em></li>
				<li><em>2.&#9;Samatwam Yoga Uchhyate—Equanimity is Yoga</em></li>
				<li><em>3.&#9;Dukha Samyogaviyogam Yoga Samjnitam —Moving away from sorrows is Yoga</em></li>
			</ol>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Fundamentals of Yoga </h2>
			<p class="Normal-copy">Yoga has many benefits—physiological, psychic and spiritual. It is like a full coconut. Even the outer husk is called coconut as long as it is associated with the internal part. The moment the outer cover is peeled off, it is called the husk and not a coconut. So, it is now the coconut shell. As long as it is associated with the kernel, it is called a coconut. If not, it is called a shell. Similarly with Yoga, if the postures, breathing, relaxations etc., are not associated with the divinity within, it is a mere gymnastics and not true Yoga. When the postures, breathing and contemplation are associated with the divinity within, then only it can be  called Yoga.</p>
			<p>Our true personality is covered by five sheaths — <em>annamaya kosha, pranamaya kosha, manomaya kosha, vijnanamaya kosha </em>and <em>ananadamaya kosha</em>. The <em>annamaya kosha </em>(physical sheath) is made of the earth,  water and fire elements. The <em>pranamaya kosha </em>(pranic sheath) is made of air and ether. The <em>manomaya kosha </em>(mental sheath) is made of <em>mana </em>(mind), <em>buddhi </em>(intelligence) and <em>ahamkara </em>(ego). The <em>vijnanamaya kosha </em>(knowledge sheath) is made of <em>chitta </em>(memory). The <em>anandamaya kosha </em>(bliss sheath) is made of <em>chetana </em>(full expansion of memory). Beyond the <em>anandamaya kosha </em>is our individual self, which together with the <em>Paramatma </em>(Self of all) becomes <em>jnana ananda swarupa </em>(knowledge bliss personified). </p>
			<p>In <em>Pani Sukta </em>of <em>Rig Veda</em>, <em>manomaya kosha </em>is called as intellectual sheath and <em>vijnanamaya kosha </em>is called as intuitional sheath. In <em>manomaya kosha </em>the mind follows the logic whereas in <em>vijnanamaya kosha </em>the logic follows the mind. In the heart of a true scientist or a Yogi the truth is first revealed and then logic follows. In <em>manomaya kosha </em> we arrive at a conclusion based on logic.<em>Acharya Madwa </em> says through logic we can prove or disprove anything. Truth lies beyond the realm of logic. The <em>Pani Sukta </em>says when the <em>vijnanamaya kosha </em> (intuitional sheath) opens up, the Yogi gets the protection of all divine beings and they protect his or her <em>yajna </em> (work) from all demonic forces. Here, the intuition is compared to a wish yielding cow and intellect is compared to a misleading dog. When this truth is dawned within the heart, it opens up the gates of bliss within <em>anandamaya kosha.</em></p>
			<p>Everyone is eligible to practice Yoga — young, old, very old, sick, and infirm — and anyone who practices without laziness gains the benefit. The benefits of yoga are multi faceted — the body becomes light, our ability to multitask and work without tension increases, digestive fire increases, fat reduces, overall health improves and mind becomes calm and develops inner peace. By practicing yoga, we become healthy —physically, mentally and spiritually.</p> 
			<p>Ayurveda<em>, </em>the ancient Indian medical system, defines health as: </p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Samadhatu-samanagni</em><br /> <em>samadoshamalakriyah</em><br /> <em>Prasanna-atmendraiya-manah-arogya ityabhidhiyate </em></p>
			<p>‘A person is healthy if all seven <em>dhatus </em>the body’s building blocks are balanced — <em>Twak </em>(outer skin); <em>charma </em>(inner skin); <em>mamsa </em>(flesh); <em>rakta </em>(blood); <em>asthi </em>(bone); <em>majja </em>(marrow); <em>medas </em>(fat); balanced together with <em>veerya </em>(creative energy in men and women); good digestive fire; balanced <em>kapha </em>(phlegm), <em>pitta </em>(bile) and <em>vata </em>(air); normal bowel movement; contentment and happiness within; peace of mind.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Types of Yoga </h2>
			<p>Bhagawat Gita divides yoga into four categories — Karma, Bhakti, Jnana and Raja yoga. These yogas are similar to writing an examination paper. The writing part is <em>Karma yoga</em>, submitting the paper is <em>Bhakti yoga</em>, writing the relevant things is <em>Jnana Yoga </em>and writing within the time frame is Raja Yoga. In order to pass the exam we need all four yogas. I cannot say, ‘I am <em>Karma Yogi</em>, I will write the exam but will not submit it.’ If we do this we will not pass the examination. If I am an expert in Karma yoga, I need to be an expert in other yogas as well.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Karma Yoga</h2>
			<p class="Normal-copy">Shri Krishna in Bhagawat Gita says that ‘<em>we cannot live without doing Karma </em>(action or work)’<em>. </em>Shri Krishna urges us to do actions in such a way that there is no adverse reaction. <em>Kar </em>means ‘tax’, <em>ma </em>means ‘to know’ — to know that we need to pay tax to the creator by serving his creation is Karma yoga. </p>
			<p>We cannot escape work. The work won’t become a burden and in fact, it becomes a joy if we change the intention. Moving from an attitude of ‘working for myself’ to ‘working for ourselves’ is Karma yoga. Only a <em>jnani </em>(person with knowledge) can practice Karma yoga, as the <em>jnani </em>knows what Karma is. </p>
			<p>There are four types of Karma — <em>akarma, vikarma, sakama karma </em>and <em>nishkama karma. </em>To remember them the following examples are given: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>We do not want to work, we do not want pay (lazy type): akarma</em></li>
				<li><em>We do not want to work but we want pay (exploitative type):  vikarma</em></li>
				<li><em>We will work but for pay only (selfish type): sakama karma</em></li>
				<li><em>We want to work irrespective of the reward (selfless type): nishkama karma</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The expansion from <em>sakama karma </em>(selfish motive) to <em>nishkama karma</em> (selfless motive) is Karma yoga. This is a key to success.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Bhakti Yoga </h2>
			<p>Bhakti means surrendering to the Supreme with devotion, knowledge and conviction. Without knowledge, surrendering is a blind belief. Love is divided into four categories. When we love someone younger than us it is called <em>vatsalya</em>, when we love the opposite sex it is <em>kama</em>, when we love someone of equal status it is <em>sneha </em> and when we love someone higher than us it is <em>bhakti </em> or <em>prema</em>.</p>
			<p>There are three types of Bhakti. </p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Uttama</em> (best): The Lord alone is  deserved to be revered, and he or she with awareness of this is the bestBhakta (devotee). This type of devotee sees the same Lord in all.</li>
				<li><em>Madhyama</em> (average): All devatas (divine beings) are the same and these people are called Traividyas.</li>
				<li><em>Adhama</em> (inferior):Worships bhootas (ghosts) and pretas (evil forces) and treat them as the supreme.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In <em>Srimat Bhagawatam</em>,the <em>nava vidha Bhakti </em> (nine steps of Bhakti) are described as:</p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Sravanam Kirtanam Vishnoh</em><br /> <em>Smaranam Padasevanam</em><br /> <em>Archanam Vandanam Dasyam</em><br /> <em>Sakhyam Atmanivedanam </em></p>
			<p>This means: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Sravanam</em> (listening to Lord’s Lilas and stories),</li>
				<li><em>Kirtanam Vishnu</em> (singing His glories),</li>
				<li><em>Smaranam</em> (rememberance of the Lord’s name and presence),</li>
				<li><em>Padasevanam</em> (service at His feet),</li>
				<li><em>Archanam</em> (worshipping the Lord),</li>
				<li><em>Vandanam</em> (prostration to the Lord),</li>
				<li><em>Dasyam</em> (cultivating the bhava (attitude) of a servant of the Lord),</li>
				<li><em>Sakhyam</em> (cultivation of the friendship with the Lord ), and</li>
				<li><em>Atmanivedanam</em> (complete surrender of oneself to the Lord).</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Jnana Yoga </h2>
			<p>Thirst for knowledge of the higher self. True knowledge is inexhaustible wealth. Ordinary wealth disappears as we spend it, but with knowledge, the more we share it, the more we gain. The Bhagawat Gita says, <em>Na hi jnanena sadrisham pavitram iha vidyate</em> — ‘There is no purifier like knowledge. Knowledge makes us fearless and strong.’ With <em>jnana, bhakti</em> increases. With <em>bhakti, jnana</em> increases.With <em>jnana and bhakti, vairagya</em> (detached attachment – like a water drop on the lotus flower) dawns in.</p>
			<p>In the 8th century Acharya Shankara (propounder of <em>Mayavada</em>), explained in his <em>Viveka Chudamani</em>that the seeker needs to acquire four qualities — <em>Viveka, Vairagya, Shat-Sampatti, and Mumukshutva.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Viveka</em> is discrimination—discrimination between the eternal and the non-eternal.</li>
				<li><em>Vairagya</em> is dispassion towards temporary things in life.</li>
				<li><em>Shat-Sampatti</em> are the six virtues:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Shama:</em> Control over the mind</li>
					<li><em>Dama:</em> Control over the body</li>
					<li><em>Uparati:</em> Enjoying the lofty ideals of life</li>
					<li><em>Titiksha:</em> Endurance of afflictions without rebelling against them and without lamenting or grumbling</li>
					<li><em>Shraddha:</em> Faith or firm conviction of the truth about the soul, the science of the soul and the teachers of that science.</li>
					<li><em>Samadhana:</em> Anchoring the mind firmly on the Lord</li>	
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>Mumukshutva</em> is aspiration and ardent longing for liberation by realizing the indweller of all.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Raja Yoga</h2>
			<p>The Scriptures say, <em>Mana Eva Manushyanam Karanam Bandha Mokshayoh</em>—‘Mind alone is the source of bondage and liberation.’ Like with the same key we can lock and unlock, so is the mind which is the source of both our bondage and liberation. The art of managing the mind is Raja Yoga. Patanjali elaborates exhaustively in his <em>Yoga Sutras</em>. The <em>Hata Yoga Pradipika</em> and <em>Gheranda Samhita </em>are the other authoritative texts of yoga. They are explained further in the following chapters.</p>
