		<p>Yoga means different things to different people. Some schools focus on only body workouts, while some Vedanta schools talk only about intellectually oriented ideas. But we do need a strong body and a sharp mind, so that we not only have well developed personality but also a fit mind for appropriate sadhana. If one uses only the mind, the body becomes weak. On the other hand, if one uses only the body, then the mind becomes weak.</p>
