		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Patanjali Yoga Sutra</h1>
		<p>Patanjali Yoga Sutra comprises of 195 sutras contained in four chapters called — <em>Samadhi Pada</em>(yoga and its aim)<em>, Sadhana Pada</em>(how to practise), <em>Vibhuti Pada</em>(what are the siddis we get) and<em> Kaivalya Pada</em>(how to attain liberation). Patanjali starts his sutras with <em>Atha Yoga anushasanam</em>. There is a similarity between this sutra and the first sutra of Brahma Sutra which says <em>Athato Brahma jijnasa</em>. Both start with ‘<em>Atha</em>’. ‘<em>A</em>’ means<em> Aha iti Brahma</em> — the Supreme. <em>Tata</em> means ‘all pervasive’. This means we need to practise yoga with earnest desire to know about the all pervasive Brahma — the Supreme.</p>
		<p>Patanjali says <em>Yogah Chittavrittinirodhaha </em> — Do not brood over the past or worry about the future, be in the present moment, elevate your mind to <em>Nirodha</em>. There arefive types of mind <em>(chitta) </em>and they are <em>kshipta, mooda, vikshipta, ekagra and nirodha.</em></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Patanjali says move away from <em>kshipta, mooda, vikshipta</em> and <em>ekagra</em> to <em>nirodha.</em></li>
<li><em>Kshipta </em>mind is active <em>(rajasic) </em>in nature, moves only in bank balance, house, property and it does not go beyond this realm.</li>
<li><em>Mooda </em>mind is dull <em>(tamasic) </em>in nature and no interest in any growth.</li>
<li><em>Vikshipta  </em>mind is vacillating — some times thinks pure <em>(satwic)</em> and loftier things with full conviction and sometimes moves away from this.</li>
<li><em>Ekagra</em>mind is, getting the concentration to acquire higher knowledge for some time.</li>
<li>In  <em>Nirodha</em>mind, one stops moving from object to object and ensures that every undertaking one starts is being completed. Then only <em>tada-drastuhu-swarupe avasthanam</em> — Then one resides in one’s own nature.</li> 
<li>Patanjali further says that we need to have patience and perseverance in our <em>sadhana</em>(practise).</li>
<li><em>Abyasa Vairagyabhyam Tannirodhaha</em> — This  <em>Nirodha</em>state can be achieved through practise and by having higher goals in life and not getting bogged down by trivial things in life <em>(vairagya).</em></li>
<li>Patanjali says our practise becomes firmly grounded when it is done with devotion for a long uninterrupted time — <em>Satu deerghakaala nairantarya-satkarya-sevito dridha-bhoomihi</em>.</li>
<li>To be successful in yoga practise, student of yoga should develop undisturbed calmness of the mind by cultivating friendliness towards happy, compassion towards the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference towards the wicked — <em>maitri karuna mudita upekshnanaam sukha dukha punya apunya vishayanaam bhaavanaatah chitta prasadanam</em>.</li>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Patanjali’s Ashtanga Yoga (Eight Limbed Yoga)</h2>
<p>Patanjali in the second chapter, <em>Sadhana Pada,</em> elaborates <em>Ashtanga Yoga. Yoganga anusthana-ashuddikshaye jnana-diptira-vivekakyate.</em> — As soon as all impurities have been removed by the practise of spiritual disciplines through the limbs of yoga – a man’s spiritual vision opens to light giving knowledge of Atman.</p>
<p>The eight limbs of yoga are: <em>Yama, Niyama, Asana,  Pranayama,  Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana </em> and  <em>Samadhi. Pratyahara,  Dharana, Dhyana</em> and <em>Samadhi</em> are the internal sadhana. <em>Yama, Niyama, Asana</em> and <em>Pranayama</em>are the external sadhana. <em>Yama</em>and <em>Niyama</em> lay the ground rules for the practise of yoga.  If we follow these ground rules, we will be successful in our practise. <em>Yama</em> and <em>Niyama</em> have five principles in each. They are like fences that protect our sadhana. Without proper fencing, all the energy acquired gets dissipated and our practise will not be successful. The five principles of <em>Yama</em> are the social norms we need to observe and the five principles of <em>Niyama</em>are the spiritual norms. We need a balanced social and spiritual life. This is symbolized in the <em>swastika</em> symbol where the horizontal line indicates social life and the vertical line represents the spiritual life. The five <em>Yamas</em> are <em>Ahimsa, Satya Asteya, Brahmachaya</em> and <em>Aparigraha</em>. The five <em>Niyamas</em> are  <em>Shoucha, Santosha, Tapas, Swadhyaya</em> and  <em>Ishwara Pranidhaana</em>. We will see these in detail below.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Yama</h2>
<p>The principles of Yama are for building a healthy society. There are five Yamas — <em>Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya</em> and <em>Aparigraha.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Ahimsa</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures place a lot of emphasis on <em>ahimsa</em> or non-violence. This is the foundation and basis of yoga and all spiritual pursuits. In <em>Anu Gita</em> of the Mahabharata, Shri Krishna compares <em>ahimsa</em> to an elephant’s foot imprint. The elephant’s foot imprint is so big that it encompasses all other animals’ imprints.</p>
<p>Therefore all dharmas are contained within <em>ahimsa</em>. When we kill some animal for our pleasure, we are not following <em>ahimsa</em> and this is against the principle of yoga. Humans are supposed to be the protectors not destroyers. When we eat animal meat, it decreases the digestive fire (<em>jathara-agni</em>), which results in various <em>vata</em> (air), <em>kapha</em> (phlegm) and <em>pitta</em>(fire) <em>doshas</em> (defects). In this way violence inflicted on others affects the doer also.</p>
<p>When <em>ahimsa</em> is not mastered we get disturbed thoughts. This affects our meditation and inner peace.</p>
<p>Food we eat is made of earth, water and fire elements. When we eat food, each part goes to a particular part of the body — earth in the food goes to the earth element, water goes to the water element and fire goes to the fire element.</p>
<p>The <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> says that of the solid food we eat, the gross part becomes stool, the subtle part goes to flesh and the fine part goes to mind. <em>We think according to what we eat</em>. Of the liquid we drink, the gross part becomes urine, the subtle part goes to the blood and the fine part goes to <em>prana</em>, breath. <em>We talk according to what we drink</em>. Of the fire part of the food, the gross part goes to bone, the subtle part goes to marrows and the fine part goes to speech.</p>
<p>The scriptures say: <em>Hita bhuk mita bhuk kshuda bhuk rita bhuk na tu rogawan bhavati</em> — One who eats good food, in limited quantity, when hungry, earned through the right means, will never become ill.</p>
<p>In Bhagawat Gita, Shri Krishna says to have success in yoga we need to observe discipline.</p>
<p class="verse"><em>Yuktaaharaviharasya<br /> yuktachestasya karmasu<br /> yuktaswapnaavabodhasya<br /> yogo bhavati dukhaha</em></p>
<p class="verse-author">B.G. 6-17</p>
<p>He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practising yoga.</p>
<p>Lord Shri Krishna in Bhagawat Gita further says we are what we eat. The type of food we like depends on our nature  — <em>satwic </em>(pure), <em>rajasic</em> (vibrant) or <em>tamasic </em>(dull).</p>
<p>Lord Shri Krishna further elaborates:</p>
<p class="verse"><em>Ayuh satva balarogya-<br /> sukha preeti vivardhanah<br /> rasyah snigdhah stira hrdya<br /> aharah saativika priyah</em></p>
<p class="verse-author"><em>B.G. 17-8</em></p>
<p>Foods which promote life, vitality, strength, health, happiness and satisfaction are succulent, juicy, nourishing, pleasing to the heart and are appealing to those of <em>satwic</em> (pure) nature.</p>
<p class="verse"><em>katva amla lavana ushna<br /> teeksna rooksha vidaahinaha<br /> ahara rajasasyesta<br /> dukha dosha mayapradaaha </em></p>
<p class="verse-author"><em>B.G. 17-9</em></p>
<p>Food that is spicy, salty, hot, sour and which produces grief appeals to persons of <em>rajasic </em> (vibrant) nature.</p>
<p class="verse"><em>yaatayaamam gatarasam<br /> pootiparyushitam cha yat<br /> uchhishtam api chamedhyam<br /> bhojanam taamasa priyam</em></p>
<p class="verse-author"><em>B.G. 17-10</em></p>
<p>Food that is stale, without nutrients, smelly or partially eaten by others, appeals to persons of <em>tamasic</em> (dull) nature.</p>
<p>Ahimsa does not mean ‘be passive’. Weeds have to be removed to protect the garden, antisocial elements need to be isolated to protect society. We are the custodians of this earth, water and air for future generations. We have no right to exploit our resources for our selfish interest. We need to be like visitors in this world and use as little as we can and give back most.</p>
<p>Physiologically, our teeth structure is not designed for eating meat. Our canine teeth are not sharp like carnivorous animals.</p>
<p>Our digestive system is not designed for meat. Our intestine is about 10 M long and convoluted unlike that in carnivorous animals. The food we consume should be assimilated within 3–4 hours. Ghee and honey get absorbed quickly into the body. Fruits get assimilated within 1–2 hours. Vegetables and pulses get absorbed in 3–4 hours. Meat and egg take more than 5 hours to get assimilated into the body. The longer the food remains in the digestive track, we get more health related problems.</p>
<p>It is said that those who know the art of eating are disease free. Food is the best medicine. We need to chew our food well so that enough saliva is produced, which helps in digestion. There are some famous sayings about how we should eat. ‘Chew your food as your stomach has no teeth’, ‘Taste your food, your stomach has no taste buds’ and ‘Eat to live and not live to eat’. We should know how much to eat. It is said that our stomach should be half full with solids, quarter full with water and a quarter should be empty. The quantity of food we eat depends on the type of work we do. The <em>Vasista Smriti </em> and  <em>Varaha Purana  </em> says  <em>ekadashyam upavaso yam nirmitam paramoushadam</em> — fasting once a fortnight on the day of <em>ekadashi</em> (the 11th day after a full moon and new moon) is the best medicine. Fasting rests the digestive system, digestive fluids get regenerated and the mind becomes fresh and clear.</p> 
<p>Two thirds of the Earth is covered with water. But less than 3&#37; is fresh water and less than 1&#37; is accessible for human use. The data indicates that a cattle consumes 100 kg of hay and 4 kg of grain for every 1 kg of beef produced. Using this basic rule it would take about 1,000 liters of water to produce 1 kg of hay and grain, thus about 100,000 liters are required to produce 1 kg of beef. The table below gives the amount of water required to produce one kilogram of each of the produce.</p>

<p>Livestock farming contributes significantly to climate change. Stop eating meat and your <em>“carbon footprint”</em> will be smaller. Methane has around 25 times the global warming impact than CO<sub>2</sub>. Ruminant mammals (cows and sheep) are responsible for 37&#37; of the total methane generated by human activity.</p>
<p>Worldwide, farmed animals produce more greenhouse gas emissions (18&#37;) than the world’s entire transport system. This has prompted many Western European countries to go meat free day once a week, on Thursdays.</p>
<p>We can therefore conclude that for spiritual, physiological and economical reasons it is not sustainable to eat meat. For the person who masters ahimsa (non injury) in his or her presence, there is no feeling of hatred.</p>
	<p><strong>2. Satya</strong></p>
<p>Satya means truth. What one sees may not be the truth. What one sees need not be the absolute truth. The absolute truth may be different from what is apparent. Until we understand the absolute truth we can follow one general rule, that of being true to ourselves. Thinking, acting and talking should be in harmony.</p>
<p><em>Satyam bruyaat priyam bruyaat nabruyaat satyam apriyam</em> — Tell the truth which brings forth good. If the truth does not bring good results, then it is not truth. By telling a lie, if it brings good results to others, then it is also regarded as truth. If a mother says there are no more sweets at home with the intention of protecting her child’s teeth, even when sweets are at home, then it is called truth.</p>
<p>For the person who masters <em>Satya</em> (Truth), all his/her wishes come true and his or her needs will be fulfilled without asking.</p>
	<p><strong>3. Asteya</strong></p>
<p>Asteya means non-stealing. Stealing means taking anything that belongs to another. Knowledge can also be stolen. Corruption is also a form of stealing. Stealing of any kind disturbs our inner peace.</p>
<p>For the person who masters <em>asteya</em> (non-stealing), all his or her needs will be fulfilled without asking.</p>
	<p><strong>4. Brahmacharya</strong></p>
	<p>Brahmacharya is moderation in recreation to avoid dissipation of energy. Brahma means something big, noble. Brahmacharya means one who thinks and contemplates on lofty ideals in life. Always, think big, think noble and work towards it, as one becomes what one thinks. This is Brahmacharya and the secret for success.</p>
	<p>The person who masters Brahmacharya radiates spiritual energy, outward joy and inner peace. Please refer to YouTube for further information: <a>www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnmCMh5cfOk</a></p>
	<p><strong>5. Aparigraha</strong></p>
	<p>Aparigraha means non-hoarding. One should not hoard things which are of no immediate use. A lot of energy is wasted in preserving things. When we see advertisements of stock clearance sales, we rush to get unnecessary things. Minimize your needs. Without observing <em>aparigraha,</em> we cannot observe <em>brahmacharya</em>. Without <em>brahmacharya</em> we cannot be established in  <em>asteya.</em> Without establishing oneself in <em>asteya</em> there is no <em>satya.</em> Without  <em>satya</em>there is no <em>ahimsa.</em> The person who masters <em>aparigraha</em> (non hoarding) obtains the knowledge of present, past and future.</p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Niyama</h2>
<p>Niyama is for the blossoming of our inner personality. There are five Niyamas — <em>Shoucha, Santosha, Tapas, Swadyaya </em>and <em>Ishwara Pranidhana</em>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Shoucha</strong></p>
<p>Shoucha means purity. Purity should exist in speech and at the physical and mental level. Purity leads to clarity in thinking. We become pure when we think of the purest indwelling Lord in everyone of us. By the practise of yoga we can purify ourselves. As a result of purity, there arises indifference to the body and the person no more enjoys the mundane company of worldly people.</p>
<p><strong>2. Santosha</strong></p>
<p>Santosha means contentment. Santosha is the hallmark of a student of higher knowledge. This cannot be achieved through outer pursuits, but only through introspection and reflecting on loftier ideals in life. There should be inner contentment. We should be contented with what we have in life but should not be restrained while serving the needy. We should reduce our own needs. There are three types of Santosha— <em>satwic </em> (pure), <em>rajasic </em> (vibrant) and  <em>tamasic  </em>(dull). Taking another’s belongings for personal enjoyment is <em>tamasic  </em>santosha. Enjoying one’s own things without sharing is <em>rajasic </em>(dynamic). Sharing with others what one has is <em>satwic </em> santosha which results in contentment and peace. As a result of <em>satwic </em>(pure) santosha, one gains supreme happiness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Tapas</strong></p>
<p>Tapas means austerity. Tapas is the ability to endure difficulties without complaining. Tapas also means deep thinking. By thinking deeply, inner truth is revealed to us. Until truth is revealed, it is just information. With the revelation of truth, extreme joy dawns within, which cannot be purchased with external wealth. Shri Krishna in Bhagawat Gita says <em>yajna </em>(worship), <em>daana </em>(charity) and <em>tapas </em> purifies even the <em>jnanis</em>(knowers of Truth) and should not be given up. As a result of tapas, impurities are removed and special powers come to the body and sense organs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Swadhyaya</strong></p>
<p>Swadhyaya means introspection. One should not forsake daily scriptural and self study. Reflect on these.  means  (independent). Thinking about the independent reality is swadhyaya. While reading the scriptures we should try to look for inner meaning and not get satisfied with the superficial meaning. Swadhyaya means studying scriptures of your religion. There is no end to study. As seekers of higher knowledge, we need to take an oath to become a lifelong student. The money we earn may be lost, but the knowledge we acquire will never leave us and it will also be our companion in the next life.  <em>Taiteriya Upanishad</em>  says <em>swadhyaya pravachane cha </em>— learning and passing on what you have learnt should go together. Just as hoarding money is a sin, so is hoarding of knowledge. Our learning gets reinforced only if we pass it on to others. Without passing it on to others our learning will not bear fruit. As a result of swadhyaya, one obtains the vision of that aspect of God which one has chosen to worship.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ishwara Pranidhana</strong></p>
<p>Iswara Pranidhana means complete surrender to the Lord. Devotion and surrender to the Lord is paramount for a spiritual aspirant. Without devotion, swadhyaya and tapas become meaningless.</p>
<p><em>Sadhana</em> is daily practise. This should be done at least twice a day during the <em>Sandhya</em>– at sunrise and sunset for best results. Without <em>Ishwara Pranidhana,</em> our <em>swadhyaya</em> is not <em>swadhyaya.</em> Without <em>swadhyaya</em> there is no <em>tapas.</em> Without <em>tapa</em>s there is no<em>santosha.</em>Without <em>santosha</em> there is no <em>shoucha.</em></p>
<p>As a result of Ishwara pranidhana, one achieves Samadhi. <em>Tapas  </em>(enduring difficulties and austerities), <em>Swadhyaya </em> (self study, daily reading of Holy Scriptures) and  <em>Ishwara Pranidhana</em> (surrender to God), when practised together is referred to as <em>Kriya Yoga</em>.</p>
