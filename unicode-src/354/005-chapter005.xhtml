The Shat Karma Kriyas are <em>Neti</em>, <em>Kapalabhati</em>, <em>Douti</em>, <em>Basti</em>, <em>Nauli</em> and <em>Tratak</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Subsequent Kriyas</strong></p>
<p>After  <em>Shanka Prakshalana, </em>do  <em>Douti  </em>to remove excess water from the system. Also do <em>Jala Neti </em>followed by <em>Kapalabati </em>to avoid getting a headache. Do <em>Agnisara Kriya </em>and do Yoga Nidra for 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Food Restriction</strong></p>
<p>For one month, after the practise of <em>Shanka Prakshalana kriya, </em>all chemically processed, synthetic, pungent, spicy, acidic, rich and non-vegetarian food must be strictly avoided including pickles, chocolates, sweets, ice cream and soft drinks. Milk, butter milk, yoghurt and all acidic fruits such as lime, grapefruit, oranges and pineapples should be avoided. Coffee, tea, alcohol and other intoxicants should not be consumed.</p>
<p>The diet should be pure, simple and natural. It may include food such as rice, wheat, bread, vegetables, nuts, lentils and other pulses. Use common sense when planning your diet. </p>
<p><strong>Special Food</strong></p>
<p><em>Kichari  </em>prepared with Basmati Rice and Mung Dal, cooked with ghee is ideal to eat after  <em>Shanka Prakshalana kriya</em>. The rice and lentils should be cooked together so that the final preparation is semi-liquid.</p> 
<p>The ghee provides the necessary coating to the intestinal walls until the body produces a new lining. The rice provides a simple, easily digestible packing material in the form of carbohydrate, and creates mucus which also protects the inner lining of the alimentary canal. Lentils supplement the diet by giving the body an easily digestible source of protein, and makes for an all-round nutritious meal. </p>
<p>Sufficient quantity of <em>kichari  </em>must be eaten to keep the walls of the gut stretched, otherwise they may cramp due to the absence of bulk food. This bulk helps in the resumption of peristaltic motion and prevents indigestion, diarrhoea and constipation. No water or other fluids should be taken for at least 2 hours after the first meal. </p>
<p>The second meal of <em>kichari </em>should be taken about 6 hours after the first meal.</p>
<p><strong>&#9888; Caution</strong></p>
<p>People with kidney problems, high blood pressure and pregnant women should avoid doing  <em>Shanka Prakshalana kriya</em>. People with medical conditions should seek expert advice before doing this kriya. Beginners should do this kriya under supervision.</p>
