<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Things to Know Before the Practise of Yoga</h2>
<p>One should empty the bowel and bladder before doing asana or pranayama. It is recommended to do asana and pranayama on empty stomach or about 3â€“4 hours after the meal for good results. It is recommended that you do the sadhana (regular practise) early in the morning. If early mornings are not practical, it can be done in the evenings about 30 minutes before a meal. </p>
<p>Inverted asanas like <em>shirasasana,  sarvangasana</em>  and back bending asanas  like  <em>chakrasana</em>  are not recommended  for women during their monthly cycle  time. But discomfort during the monthly  cycle time can be reduced by doing  the forward bending asanas like <em>janu  shirasasana, upavista konasana, badda  konasana, paschimottasana, uttanasana,  adhomukha swanasana, kurmasana,  ardha matsyendrasana, vajrasana,  veerasana </em>  etc.</p>  
<p>Pregnant women can perform some simple asanas during the first 3 months of pregnancy but are advised not to perform twisting asanas like <em>parivritta trikonasana, parivritta paschimottasana </em> etc. </p>
<p>Warm up exercises help in loosening the body and are strongly recommended to be done before performing the asanas. Without proper warm up, the practitioner may experience muscle pulls, sprains or other injuries. The following warm up exercises help in warming up the body and making it supple. </p>
<p>Every body is different and everybody is different. While doing your practise do not compare yourself with others. Pain is a good indicator of when you need to stop. Extreme care should be taken while doing the practise so that you do not injure yourself. Try to synchronize your movement with breathing. The general rule is that when you squeeze your lungs you exhale, and when you open your lungs you inhale. </p>
<p>If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, please obtain appropriate medical advice before commencing your practise.</p>
