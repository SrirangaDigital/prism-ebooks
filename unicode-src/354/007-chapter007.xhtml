		<p><strong>Lying Down Asanas</strong></p>
		<p>According to the Bhagawat Gita, asana means seat on which we sit. <i>Asana  </i>also means posture. The main purpose of asana is to be able to sit in one position without discomfort for a long time, so that we can contemplate on a lofty ideal for a long time. The body is compared to a vessel or container and the mind is compared to water in the container. If the vessel is unsteady, water in the vessel, i.e. the mind also becomes unsteady. Even if a breeze passes over the vessel, the water will be disturbed. In the same way, erratic breathing makes the mind unsteady. To have a steady mind we need stable body and smooth even breathing. Practise of asana increases the lung capacity, opens up the chest and strengthens the spinal column and limbs. Therefore asana is a stepping stone to pranayama and higher levels of sadhana.</p> 
		<p>Asana also means <i>ashraya — </i>taking shelter in the postures. Practising asana and pranayama revives our dormant energy. This rejuvenates the tissues, nervous system and regulates blood circulation. According to the laws of physiology, when the body contracts and expands, energy is developed and diseases get cured. This can be achieved through various yoga asanas. With the practise of asana and pranayama, the glands and muscles of the body contract and expand, toxins get expelled and as a result good health is regained or maintained.</p> 
		<p>The following asanas help in strengthening and energizing the body. They also help in removing gross impurities from the body.</p>
