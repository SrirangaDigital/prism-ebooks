		<p><em>Prana</em> is not just breathing. Breathing is the external sign of <em>Prana</em>. Yogis can live without breathing for a long time. When the <em>Prana</em> leaves the body, breathing stops and that body is then called dead. Since we have <em>Prana</em> in the body we are called “<em>Prani.</em>”</p>
		<p><em>Pra</em> means <em>prakrista,</em> which means special. <em>Ana</em> means <em>bala,</em> meaning strength. That which gives strength to us is <em>Prana</em>. There are three <em>Prana</em>s – <em>Mukhya Prana</em> (main <em>Prana</em>), <em>Madhyama Prana</em> (middle level <em>Prana</em>) and <em>Adhama Prana</em> (lower <em>Prana</em>). The Supreme indweller, the Lord is <em>Mukhya</em> <em>Prana</em>. <em>Hanuman</em>, who is the vehicle of the Lord, is <em>Madhyama Prana</em>. The individual soul is called <em>Adhama Prana</em>. The <em>Madhyama Prana</em> (or simply <em>Prana</em>) is the Guru for all souls (jivas) and takes them to the <em>Mukhya Prana</em>. <em>Prana</em> takes the individual soul after death to the appropriate destination according to the soul’s karma. There is no rest for <em>Prana</em>, who makes us breathe even when we are asleep.</p>
		<p><em>Prana</em> protects the soul even at the time of universal dissolution. When the <em>Mukhya</em> <em>Prana</em> (Lord) decides to leave the body, <em>Prana</em> also leaves the body. The <em>Shat</em> <em>Prastnopanishad</em> says that the Lord wanted a perfect personal assistant and he chose <em>Prana</em>. In <em>Vishnu Sahsranama</em>, the Lord has been described twice as using <em>Prana</em> as His vehicle — <em>Vayu Vahana</em>. The Vedas refer to <em>Prana</em> as <em>dhoo,</em> meaning that, death does not come near him. Death is scared to come near those who practise Pranayama.</p>
		<p>Our scriptures say that we have various deities who function in the body, like the Sun in the eyes, the Moon in the ears, the Aswini Kumaras<em></em> in our nostrils, Agni in our mouth, Shiva in the mind, etc. These deities can function in our body only when we have the <em>Prana</em> (vital air) in the body. When the <em>Prana</em> leaves the body, all other deities cannot function any more. <em>Pranayama</em> means getting the grace of <em>Mukhya</em> <em>Prana</em> (the Lord) and Madhyama <em>Prana</em> (<em>Hanuman</em>) so that <em>Adhama Prana</em>’s (the <em>jiva</em>’s or soul’s) journey towards the Lord continues without any hindrances.</p>
		<p>In the fourth chapter of the Bhagawat Gita, <em>Pranayama</em> is defined as <em>Apane juhvati</em> <em>Pranam Pranapane tathapare Pranapana</em> <em>gatee rudhwa Pranayamaparayanaha</em> -‘Yogis join the downward flowing <em>Prana</em> with the upward flowing <em>Prana</em>’, regulating the rate of inhalation and exhalation is <em>Pranayama</em>.</p>
		<p>Patanjali defines <em>Pranayama</em> as <em>Tasmin</em> <em>Sati Swasa Praswasayorgati Vicheedanah</em> <em>Pranayama</em> — ‘After mastering the posture, one must practise control of <em>Prana</em> by regulating the inhalation and exhalation.’ Patanjali further describes the benefits of <em>Pranayama</em> as <em>Tatah</em> <em>Ksheeyate Prakashaavaranam</em> — The result of <em>Pranayama</em> is that the covering on the <em>inner Light</em> is removed. According to the Gheranda Samhita, the body becomes light and energetic by doing <em>Pranayama</em> correctly.</p>
		<p>There are 4 phases in Pranayama. They are <em>Puraka</em> (inhale), <em>Rechaka</em> (exhale), <em>Anthar</em> <em>Kumbhaka</em> (retaining air inside) and <em>Bhahya Kumbhaka</em> (holding air outside).</p>
		<p>By doing Pranayama, all 10 <em>Pranas</em> are energized. There are 5 main <em>Pranas</em> and 5 subtle <em>Pranas</em> (<em>Upa Pranas</em>). The Pranas and their functions are given below:</p>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th>Main Prana</th>
				<th>Upa Prana(subtle Prana)</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Prana: Mukha indriya</em> — the whole face <em>indriaya</em> - eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin.</td>
				<td><em>Dhanajaya</em>: Opening and closing of the heart valve; protection of the body even after death</td>

		<p>Humans normally breathe 15-20 times a minute. Rabbits breathe 60-70 times a minute. Elephants breathe 5–6 times a minute. Tortoises breathe 2–3 times a minute. Rabbits live for 3–5 years. Elephants live for over 150 years. The tortoise lives for about 250 years. There is a direct correlation between lifespan and the rate of breathing. By reducing the breathing rate, life expectancy increases. Lifespan is measured in terms of the number of breaths one takes and not by the number of years one lives. Some mosquitos have a life span of only 6 hours. In 6 hours they complete their birth, growth, maturity and death.</p>
		<p>It is said in <em>Shrimad Bhagawatam</em> that the creator Brahma’s one second is equal to 100,000 years of humans. Brahma’s 100 years is 3,11040,0000,000,00 (31,104 billion) human years. After Brahma’s 100 years of life span, he gets liberated and takes all the liberated souls along with him to <em>Vaikunta</em> (place with no defects) where he will be replaced by another Brahma. Everyone lives for 100 years but on a different scale. We have heard about yogis living for hundreds of years. This is because they knew the art of breathing. The slower we breathe, the longer is our life span. When we are stressed or angry, our breathing rate increases, which in turn reduces our life span.</p>
		<p>According to the scriptures, when we are relaxed it takes 2 seconds for inhalation and 2 seconds for exhalation. For one cycle of inhalation and exhalation, it takes 4 seconds. In one minute we breathe 15 times. In one hour we breathe 900 times and in one day we breathe 21,600 times. When we breathe 21,600 times, it is 1 day for the body. Instead of taking 4 seconds per cycle, by <em>Pranayama</em> practise if we take 8 seconds, it takes 2 days on the external clock to complete 21,600 breaths, which is one day by our inner clock. Our inner clock (body) may say 100 years, but the outer clock says 200 years. If we take 16 seconds per cycle, for 100 years of the inner clock, the outer clock says 400 years. Instead, if we are under stress and prone to anger, we take 2 seconds per breath cycle, to do 21,600 breaths it takes only 12 hours on the external clock. It may be 100 years for the body, but the outer clock has done only 50 years. In short, the slower we breathe, the longer we live.</p>
		<p>Breathing with awareness is <em>Pranayama</em>. <em>Pranayama</em> slows down our breathing and reveals the Inner Light by removing its covering. In <em>kumbhaka</em> (breath retention), the body function goes into hibernation. By doing <em>Pranayama</em> one is able to live one’s full life span without disease. When we breathe slowly, our mind de-stresses itself and gets relaxed. The relaxed mind expands. An expanded mind is creative. Creativity is one of the hallmarks of a true leader. <em>Pranayama</em> makes us lead our life well. When we lead our life well, we also inspire others.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hata Yoga</h2>
			<p>In the human body there are 72,000 nadis (energy carrying nerves) of which 36,000 are called female nadis (<em>Ida</em>) and 36,000 are called as male nadis (<em>Pingala</em>). Wherever the nadis meet, they form an energy centre called a <em>chakra</em>. Generally, energy does not flow properly in the body because of impurities. This is cleaned by the process of various asanas, Pranayams and Yoga Kriyas.</p>
			<p>In Hata yoga, <em>Ha</em> means Sun and<em> Ta</em> means Moon. Hata also means +ve and –ve energy. Hata yoga brings Sun and Moon centres together so that <em>Prana</em> moves through the <em>Sushumnanadi</em> (central nadi). Although we have two nostrils, the breathing usually happens only through one nostril. The left nostril is connected to the right brain. It is called <em>Ida nadi</em> (Moon nadi). Breathing in through the left nostril cools down the body. When the body get heated through emotions, <em>Prana</em> moves through the left nostril <em>(Ida)</em> to cool the body down.</p>
			<p>The right nostril is connected to the left brain. It is called <em>Pingala nadi</em> (Sun nadi). Breathing in through the right nostril heats up the body. When the body get cooled down through calm and clear thinking, <em>Prana</em> moves through the right nostril <em>(Pingala</em> <em>Nadi)</em> to warm and energize the body.</p>
			<p>This alternate switching happens every 2 hours or so. Practising <em>Pranayama</em> makes the <em>Prana</em> travel through the central <em>Sushumna nadi.</em> By bringing the <em>Prana</em> to the <em>Sushumna Nadi</em> (brining sun and moon systems together), our mind will not be disturbed and swing like a pendulum with every passing thought and emotion. This is done through <em>Nasika shuddi</em> (cleaning the nasal passage) and <em>Nadi shuddi</em> (cleaning the nadis) <em>Pranayama</em>.</p>
			<p>Hata yoga also means <em>Ida</em> and <em>Pingala</em>. <em>Ha</em> means the Sun system which is <em>Pingala</em>. <em>Ta</em> means the Moon system which is <em>Ida</em>. <em>Pingala</em> is also referred to as the river <em>Yamun</em> a, and <em>Ida</em> is referred to as the river <em>Ganga</em>. Where <em>Ganga</em> and <em>Yamuna</em> meet, that place is called <em>Prayag</em>, and there the third river <em>Saraswati</em> emerges giving it the name <em>Triveni Sangam</em> — the meeting of three rivers. <em>Sushumna nadi</em> is referred to as the river <em>Saraswati</em>. <em>Ida</em> and <em>Pingala</em> run through the spinal column like a DNA helix, and wherever they cross the <em>Sushumna</em> <em>nadi</em>, that place is called an energy centre or <em>chakra. Ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> cross each other along the central <em>Sushumna nadi</em> in seven places which are the seven main chakras — <em>Mooladhara, Swadistana, Manipura,</em> <em>Anahata, Vishudda, Ajna</em> and <em>Sahasrara.</em></p>
			<p><em>Ida</em> is referred to as feminine and <em>Pingala</em> is referred to as masculine in nature. A person with <em>Ida nadi</em> predominant is more of heart centered person and likely to be a creative person. A person with <em>Pingala</em> <em>nadi</em> predominant is a more head centered person. The <em>Pingala</em> predominant person is very rational in approach and the <em>ida</em> predominant person is very emotional in approach. To discover Self realization we need to have a balanced <em>Ida</em> and <em>Pingala</em> -well developed in head and heart — only then the well developed philosopher in us comes out. We need to be <em>Ardha Naareeswara</em> — half male and half female personality for realization of God. Realization does not happen to one who is only either a head or a heart centered person.</p>
			<p>Breathing through alternate nostrils activates the left and right brains. <em>Pranayama</em> activates not only <em>Ida</em>, <em>Pingala</em> and <em>Sushumna nadis</em> but also activates the energy centres (<em>chakras</em>) in the body.</p>
			<p>The following are some of the different <em>Pranayama</em> techniques mentioned in Hata Yoga Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita. The postures recommended for practice are <em>Siddasana, Padmasana</em>, <em>Ardha Padmasan</em>a and <em>Vajrasana</em>. Pictures 159—162 show these postures. It is highly recommended to learn the <em>Pranayama</em> under an adept teacher to avoid any side effects.</p>

			</figure>
			<p><strong>&#10162; Meaning</strong></p>
			<p><em>Shodana</em> means purifying. Nadi Shodana Pranayama<em></em> is the technique of purifying the nadis.</p>
			<p><strong>&#9758;Benefits</strong></p>
			<p>Purifies the nadis. As nadis are purified, the energy level in the body increases and the breathing deepens. When the nadis are cleansed, we are able to hear the <em>anahata</em> sound (inner sound). This harmonizes the blood pressure which in turn relaxes the mind. The relaxed mind expands and intuition dawns in an expanded mind. This leads to the opening up of <em>Vijnanamaya kosha.</em> In <em>Vijananamaya kosha</em> intuition starts working and we get flashes of inspiration, which leads us to the <em>Anandamaya kosha.</em> When the mind is expanded we are able to tap into our bliss within.</p>
