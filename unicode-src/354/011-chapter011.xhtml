		<p><i>Prana  </i>is not just breathing. Breathing is  the external sign of <i>Prana</i>. Yogis can live  without breathing for a long time. When the  <i>Prana </i>leaves the body, breathing stops and  that body is then called dead. Since we have  <i>Prana </i>in the body we are called “<i>Prani.</i>” </p>
<p><i>Pra </i>means <i>prakrista, </i>which means special.  <i>Ana  </i>means  <i>bala,  </i>meaning strength. That  which gives strength to us is <i>Prana</i>. There  are three <i>Prana</i>s – <i>Mukhya Prana </i>(main  <i>Prana</i>),  <i>Madhyama Prana </i>(middle level  <i>Prana</i>) and <i>Adhama Prana </i>(lower <i>Prana</i>).  The Supreme indweller, the Lord is <i>Mukhya </i> <i>Prana</i>.  <i>Hanuman</i>, who is the vehicle  of the Lord, is <i>Madhyama Prana</i>. The  individual soul is called <i>Adhama Prana</i>.  The  <i>Madhyama Prana </i>(or simply <i>Prana</i>)  is the Guru for all souls (jivas) and takes  them to the <i>Mukhya Prana</i>. <i>Prana </i>takes the  individual soul after death to the appropriate  destination according to the soul’s karma.  There is no rest for <i>Prana</i>, who makes us  breathe even when we are asleep. </p>
<p><i>Prana </i>protects the soul even at the time of  universal dissolution. When the <i>Mukhya </i> <i>Prana  </i>(Lord) decides to leave the body,  <i>Prana  </i>also leaves the body. The <i>Shat </i> <i>Prastnopanishad </i>says that the Lord wanted  a perfect personal assistant and he chose  <i>Prana</i>. In <i>Vishnu Sahsranama</i>, the Lord  has been described twice as using <i>Prana </i> as His vehicle — <i>Vayu Vahana</i>. The Vedas  refer to <i>Prana </i>as <i>dhoo, </i>meaning that, death  does not come near him. Death is scared to  come near those who practise Pranayama. </p>
<p>Our scriptures say that we have various  deities who function in the body, like the  Sun in the eyes, the Moon in the ears, the  Aswini Kumaras<i> </i>in our nostrils, Agni in our  mouth, Shiva in the mind, etc. These deities  can function in our body only when we have  the <i>Prana </i>(vital air) in the body. When the  <i>Prana  </i>leaves the body, all other deities  cannot function any more. <i>Pranayama </i> means getting the grace of <i>Mukhya</i>  <i>Prana  </i>(the Lord) and Madhyama <i>Prana</i>  (<i>Hanuman</i>) so that <i>Adhama Prana</i>’s (the  <i>jiva</i>’s or soul’s) journey towards the Lord  continues without any hindrances. </p>
<p>In the fourth chapter of the Bhagawat Gita,  <i>Pranayama  </i>is defined as <i>Apane juhvati </i> <i>Pranam Pranapane tathapare Pranapana </i> <i>gatee rudhwa Pranayamaparayanaha </i> -‘Yogis join the downward flowing <i>Prana </i> with the upward flowing <i>Prana</i>’, regulating  the rate of inhalation and exhalation is  <i>Pranayama</i>. </p>
<p>Patanjali defines <i>Pranayama  </i>as  <i>Tasmin </i> <i>Sati Swasa Praswasayorgati Vicheedanah </i> <i>Pranayama  </i>— ‘After mastering the  posture, one must practise control of  <i>Prana  </i>by regulating the inhalation and  exhalation.’ Patanjali further describes  the benefits of <i>Pranayama  </i>as  <i>Tatah </i> <i>Ksheeyate Prakashaavaranam </i>— The  result of <i>Pranayama  </i>is that the covering  on the <i>inner Light </i>is removed. According to  the Gheranda Samhita, the body becomes  light and energetic by doing <i>Pranayama </i> correctly. </p>
<p>There are 4 phases in Pranayama. They are  <i>Puraka </i>(inhale), <i>Rechaka </i>(exhale), <i>Anthar </i> <i>Kumbhaka</i> (retaining air inside) and  <i>Bhahya Kumbhaka</i> (holding air outside). </p>
<p>By doing Pranayama, all 10 <i>Pranas  </i>are  energized. There are 5 main <i>Pranas </i>and 5  subtle  <i>Pranas  </i>(<i>Upa Pranas</i>). The Pranas  and their functions are given below: </p>
<table>
	<tr>

<p>Humans normally breathe 15-20 times  a minute. Rabbits breathe 60-70 times  a minute. Elephants breathe 5–6 times  a minute. Tortoises breathe 2–3 times  a minute. Rabbits live for 3–5 years.  Elephants live for over 150 years. The  tortoise lives for about 250 years. There is a  direct correlation between lifespan and the  rate of breathing. By reducing the breathing  rate, life expectancy increases. Lifespan is  measured in terms of the number of breaths  one takes and not by the number of years  one lives. Some mosquitos have a life span  of only 6 hours. In 6 hours they complete  their birth, growth, maturity and death. </p>
<p>It is said in <i>Shrimad Bhagawatam </i>that  the creator Brahma’s one second is equal  to 100,000 years of humans. Brahma’s  100 years is 3,11040,0000,000,00 (31,104  billion) human years. After Brahma’s 100  years of life span, he gets liberated and  takes all the liberated souls along with him  to <i>Vaikunta </i>(place with no defects) where  he will be replaced by another Brahma.  Everyone lives for 100 years but on a  different scale. We have heard about yogis living for hundreds of years. This is because  they knew the art of breathing. The slower  we breathe, the longer is our life span. When  we are stressed or angry, our breathing rate  increases, which in turn reduces our life  span. </p>
<p>According to the scriptures, when we are  relaxed it takes 2 seconds for inhalation  and 2 seconds for exhalation. For one  cycle of inhalation and exhalation, it takes  4 seconds. In one minute we breathe 15  times. In one hour we breathe 900 times  and in one day we breathe 21,600 times.  When we breathe 21,600 times, it is 1 day  for the body. Instead of taking 4 seconds  per cycle, by <i>Pranayama</i> practise if we take  8 seconds, it takes 2 days on the external  clock to complete 21,600 breaths, which is  one day by our inner clock. Our inner clock  (body) may say 100 years, but the outer  clock says 200 years. If we take 16 seconds  per cycle, for 100 years of the inner clock,  the outer clock says 400 years. Instead, if  we are under stress and prone to anger,  we take 2 seconds per breath cycle, to do  21,600 breaths it takes only 12 hours on the  external clock. It may be 100 years for the  body, but the outer clock has done only 50  years. In short, the slower we breathe, the  longer we live. </p>
<p>Breathing with awareness is <i>Pranayama</i>.  <i>Pranayama  </i>slows down our breathing  and reveals the Inner Light by removing its  covering. In <i>kumbhaka </i>(breath retention),  the body function goes into hibernation.  By doing <i>Pranayama  </i>one is able to live  one’s full life span without disease. When  we breathe slowly, our mind de-stresses  itself and gets relaxed. The relaxed mind  expands. An expanded mind is creative.  Creativity is one of the hallmarks of a true  leader. <i>Pranayama </i>makes us lead our life  well. When we lead our life well, we also  inspire others. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hata Yoga</h2>
<p>In the human body there are 72,000  nadis (energy carrying nerves) of which  36,000 are called female nadis (<i>Ida</i>) and  36,000 are called as male nadis (<i>Pingala</i>).  Wherever the nadis meet, they form an  energy centre called a <i>chakra</i>. Generally,  energy does not flow properly in the body  because of impurities. This is cleaned by the  process of various asanas, Pranayams and  Yoga Kriyas. </p>
<p>In Hata yoga, <i>Ha </i>means Sun and<i> Ta </i>means  Moon. Hata also means +ve and –ve energy.  Hata yoga brings Sun and Moon centres  together so that <i>Prana</i> moves through the  <i>Sushumnanadi  </i>(central nadi). Although  we have two nostrils, the breathing usually  happens only through one nostril. The left  nostril is connected to the right brain. It  is called <i>Ida nadi </i>(Moon nadi). Breathing  in through the left nostril cools down the  body. When the body get heated through  emotions,  <i>Prana</i> moves through the left  nostril <i>(Ida)</i> to cool the body down. </p>
<p>The right nostril is connected to the left  brain. It is called <i>Pingala nadi </i>(Sun nadi).  Breathing in through the right nostril heats  up the body. When the body get cooled down  through calm and clear thinking, <i>Prana</i>  moves through the right nostril <i>(Pingala </i> <i>Nadi)</i> to warm and energize the body. </p>
<p>This alternate switching happens every 2  hours or so. Practising <i>Pranayama </i>makes  the  <i>Prana</i> travel through the central  <i>Sushumna nadi. </i>By bringing the <i>Prana</i> to  the <i>Sushumna Nadi </i>(brining sun and moon  systems together), our mind will not be  disturbed and swing like a pendulum with  every passing thought and emotion. This is  done through <i>Nasika shuddi </i>(cleaning the  nasal passage) and <i>Nadi shuddi </i>(cleaning  the nadis) <i>Pranayama</i>. </p>
<p>Hata yoga also means <i>Ida </i>and <i>Pingala</i>. <i>Ha </i> means the Sun system which is <i>Pingala</i>.  <i>Ta  </i>means the Moon system which is <i>Ida</i>.  <i>Pingala  </i>is also referred to as the river  <i>Yamun</i>a, and <i>Ida </i>is referred to as the river  <i>Ganga</i>. Where <i>Ganga</i> and <i>Yamuna  </i>meet,  that place is called <i>Prayag</i>, and there the  third river <i>Saraswati </i>emerges giving it the  name  <i>Triveni Sangam </i>— the meeting of  three rivers. <i>Sushumna nadi </i>is referred to  as the river <i>Saraswati</i>. <i>Ida </i>and <i>Pingala </i>run  through the spinal column like a DNA helix,  and wherever they cross the <i>Sushumna </i> <i>nadi</i>, that place is called an energy centre  or <i>chakra. Ida </i>and <i>pingala </i>cross each other  along the central <i>Sushumna nadi </i>in seven  places which are the seven main chakras  —  <i>Mooladhara, Swadistana, Manipura, </i> <i>Anahata, Vishudda, Ajna </i>and <i>Sahasrara. </i></p>
<p><i>Ida </i>is referred to as feminine and <i>Pingala </i> is referred to as masculine in nature. A  person with <i>Ida nadi </i>predominant is more  of heart centered person and likely to be  a creative person. A person with <i>Pingala </i> <i>nadi </i>predominant is a more head centered  person. The <i>Pingala  </i>predominant person  is very rational in approach and the <i>ida </i> predominant person is very emotional in  approach. To discover Self realization we  need to have a balanced <i>Ida  </i>and  <i>Pingala </i> -well developed in head and heart — only then  the well developed philosopher in us comes  out. We need to be <i>Ardha Naareeswara </i>—  half male and half female personality for  realization of God. Realization does not  happen to one who is only either a head or a  heart centered person. </p>
<p>Breathing through alternate nostrils  activates the left and right brains.  <i>Pranayama </i>activates not only <i>Ida</i>, <i>Pingala </i> and <i>Sushumna nadis </i>but also activates the  energy centres (<i>chakras</i>) in the body. </p>
<p>The following are some of the different <i>Pranayama  </i>techniques mentioned in Hata Yoga  Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita. The postures recommended for practice are <i>Siddasana</i>,  <i>Padmasana</i>, <i>Ardha Padmasan</i>a and <i>Vajrasana</i>. Pictures 159—162 show these postures. It  is highly recommended to learn the <i>Pranayama</i> under an adept teacher to avoid any side  effects. </p>

		</figure>
		<p><strong>&#10162; Meaning </strong></p>
<p><i>Shodana  </i>means purifying. Nadi Shodana Pranayama<i> </i>is the technique of purifying the nadis. </p>
 <p><strong>&#9758;Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Purifies the nadis. As nadis are purified, the energy level in the body increases and the breathing deepens. When the nadis are cleansed, we are able to hear the <i>anahata </i> sound (inner sound). This harmonizes the blood pressure which in turn relaxes the mind. The relaxed mind expands and intuition dawns in an expanded mind. This leads to the opening up of <i>Vijnanamaya kosha. </i> In  <i>Vijananamaya kosha </i>intuition starts working and we get flashes of inspiration, which leads us to the <i>Anandamaya kosha. </i> When the mind is expanded we are able to tap into our bliss within. </p>
 <p><strong>&#9881; Process</strong></p>
