		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Mudras and Bandha</h1>
		<p>Mudra means symbol. Mudra means insignia. Mudra means commitment. Samudra means full commitment. That is why God is called as Samudra, as He has full commitment in everything and never does anything half-heartedly.</p>
		<p>According to Gheranda Samhita, Mudras and Bandhas are done to steady the body. Mudras and Bandhas help in preventing the dissipation of energy, and help in redirecting the energy. Bandhas are the lock and mudras are the lock over a lock.</p>
		<p><em>Ha</em> means Sun, <em>Ta</em> means Moon. The seat of moon centre is the <em>Sahasrara chakra,</em> and the seat of Sun system is the <em>manipura chakra</em> at the navel. Our active life continues as long as the nectar remains in the <em>sahasrara chakra</em> at the crown. Just like pressing the accelerator in the car draws more fuel, when we breathe rapidly, we draw more nectar from the <em>sahasrara chakra</em> which flows into the <em>manipura chakra</em> where it gets consumed. Bandhas like Jalandhara bandha, Kriyas like Vasudeva Kriya, Viparita Karani, Asanas such as Shirasasana, Sarvangasana, Vrischikasana etc. reduce the consumption of the nectar (<em>amruta</em>) at <em>manipura chakra</em> and preserve the body’s vitality.</p>
		<p>Through manipulating our <em>Prana</em> or vital energy, we can direct it towards better health, well being and personal transformation.</p>
		<p>Mudra is defined as <em>Mudham Dadaati Devaanam Dravayasya Asuraarapi</em> – ‘That by which the divine beings get happiness and the negative forces and diseases are driven away’.’ Mudras are used in <em>Tantra puja</em>.</p>
		<p>Mudras are classified into:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Kaya Mudra (mudra through body —<em>Viparitakarani, Yoga mudra, Manduki Mudra</em> etc)</li>
			<li>Mana Mudra (mudra through the senses on the face, that is using lips, eyes, nose, ear, tongue – <em>Shambhavi, Kaki, Akashi, Nasika Dristi, Shanmukhi, Khechari)</em></li> 
			<li>Bandha <em>(Jaalandhar, Uddiyan, Moola and Maha)</em></li> 
			<li>Adhara Mudra (supporting mudras-<em>Aswini, Vrajoli</em> etc)</li>
			<li>Hasta Mudra (mudras through hands- balance the
			<ul>
				<li><em>Mahabhootas</em> like fire, water, air, earth and ether elements and</li>
				<li><em>Tanmaatras</em> like taste, touch, smell and sound in the body and</li>
				<li><em>Doshas</em> in the body like <em>kapha</em> (phlegm),<em> pitta</em> (fire) and <em>vata</em> (air).</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hasta Mudra (Hand mudra)</h2>
			<p>The body is made up of 5 elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. When these five elements are not in balance we get various physical and psychological ailments. The energy from the body radiates out mainly through the tip of the nose, lips, fingertips and toes. When the thumb is brought in contact with the other fingers, energy is directed back to vitalize various parts of our body. This is called a <em>circuit bypass</em>. Mudras and Bhandas go hand in hand. Bandhas help in locking in the energy, whereas mudras help in redirecting the energy.</p>
			<p>Mudras are the expression of our inner feeling. In the Tantra shastra, Mudra is defined as ‘<em>the one which gives happiness</em>’. Mudras form a part of yoga and are together referred to as <em>Yoga Mudra</em>. Mudras done using hands are called <em>Hasta Mudra.</em> Indian classical dances such as <em>Bharata Natyam, Yakshagana, Mohini Aattam, Kathakali, Kuchupudi, Oddissi</em> make use of mudras to express their artforms. In the temples deities show different mudras. Of those the most well-known mudra is the <em>abhaya</em> mudra (reassuring mudra). In Tirupathi, Balaji’s statue depicts that ‘if you surrender to my feet, your problems are knee deep, and you can easily walk through them.’</p>
			<p>The five fingers represent the five elements (tatvas):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Thumb: Fire <em>(agni)</em></li> 
				<li>Index Finger: Air <em>(vayu)</em></li> 
				<li>Middle finger: Space <em>(akasha)</em></li> 
				<li>Ring Finger: Earth <em>(prithvi)</em></li> 
				<li>Small finger: Water <em>(jala)</em></li> 
			</ul>
			<p>Fire is the most important of the five elements. When the fire element becomes weak in the body, various ailments come to the body. Through the practise of mudras the fire element (thumb) is joined with the other elements (other fingers) to vitalize those elements also.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Viparitakarini Mudra</h2>
			<p><strong>&#10162; Meaning</strong></p>
			<p><em>Viparitakarini</em> is an inverted posture. In fact <em>Shirasasana</em> and <em>Sarvangasana</em> are also called <em>Viparitakarini</em>. The nectar (<em>Amruta</em>) is continuously trickling down from the Moon center at the Sahasrara chakra and gets consumed in the sun centre at the <em>manipura chakra</em>. The vitality in the body exists as long as the nectar is there in the Moon centre. Once the nectar gets depleted, old age sets in. This mudra revitalizes the Moon centre.</p>
			<p><strong>&#9758;Benefits</strong></p>
			<p>This posture is similar to <em>Sarvangasana</em> except that the throat muscles are not constricted in this mudra. In this mudra, the Sun centre which is located at <em>manipura chakra,</em> goes above the Moon centre which is located at the head. Moon is called <em>Soma</em>. <em>Soma</em> means Shiva. <em>Soma</em> means <em>Mukya Prana</em>. <em>Prana</em> levels in the body increases. The digestive fire gets ignited. This energizes the mind, slows down the ageing process, slows down greying of hair, removes wrinkles on the face and increases the heart volume. It decompresses the internal organs,rehydrates the discs, slows down the heart rate, oxygenates the blood and improves the Digestion.</p>
			<p><strong>&#9881; Process</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>In <em>Viparitakarani</em> we are reversing the position of sun and moon centres so that the Sun centre goes higher than Moon and starts energizing the Moon centre.</li>
				<li>Lie down on your back and keep your hands beside the body.</li>
				<li>With inhalation raise both feet above the ground.</li>
				<li>Raise your waist up and support the back on your hands with the elbows on the ground.</li>
				<li>Bring your toes in line with your eyes.</li>
				<li>Do not throttle your neck muscles or apply any pressure on the neck muscles.</li>
				<li>Breathe normally and hold this position for 1 minute and gradually increase the duration.</li>
				<li>With exhalation slowly come down and relax. Please refer to Picture 206.</li>

			<p><strong>&#9888; Caution</strong></p>
			<p>People suffering from blood pressure, glaucoma, hernias, cardiovascular disease, cervical spondylitis, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis and kidney problems should not practice headstand. Those suffering from neck injuries should perform this kriya under supervision.</p>

			<p><em>Moola</em> means root.</p>
			<p><strong>&#9758;Benefits</strong></p>
			<p>Moola Bandha enables one in doing sadhana. It gives Dhatu-Pushti (nerve-vigour) and relieves constipation.

				<li>Place the palms on the knees.</li>
				<li>Exhale and squeeze and pull the anus muscles up so that the downward flowing <em>Apana Prana</em> is pushed upwards.</li>
