		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Mudras and Bandha</h1>
		<p>Mudra means symbol. Mudra means insignia. Mudra means commitment. Samudra means full commitment. That is why God is called as Samudra, as He has full commitment in everything and never does anything half-heartedly.</p>
<p>According to Gheranda Samhita, Mudras and Bandhas are done to steady the body. Mudras and Bandhas help in preventing the dissipation of energy, and help in redirecting the energy. Bandhas are the lock and mudras are the lock over a lock. </p>
<p><i>Ha  </i>means Sun, <i>Ta  </i>means Moon. The  seat of moon centre is the <i>Sahasrara </i> <i>chakra,  </i>and the seat of Sun system is the  <i>manipura chakra </i>at the navel. Our active  life continues as long as the nectar remains  in the <i>sahasrara chakra </i>at the crown.  Just like pressing the accelerator in the  car draws more fuel, when we breathe  rapidly, we draw more nectar from the  <i>sahasrara chakra </i>which flows into the  <i>manipura chakra </i>where it gets consumed.  Bandhas like Jalandhara bandha, Kriyas  like Vasudeva Kriya, Viparita Karani,  Asanas such as Shirasasana, Sarvangasana,  Vrischikasana etc. reduce the consumption  of the nectar (<i>amruta</i>) at <i>manipura chakra </i> and preserve the body’s vitality. </p>
<p>Through manipulating our <i>Prana</i> or  vital energy, we can direct it towards  better health, well being and personal  transformation. </p>
<p>Mudra is defined as <i>Mudham Dadaati </i> <i>Devaanam Dravayasya Asuraarapi </i>– ‘That  by which the divine beings get happiness and  the negative forces and diseases are driven  away’.’ Mudras are used in <i>Tantra puja</i>. </p>
<p>Mudras are classified into: </p>
<ul>
<li>Kaya Mudra (mudra through body —<i>Viparitakarani, Yoga mudra, Manduki </i><i>Mudra </i>etc) </li>
<li>Mana Mudra (mudra through the senses on the face, that is using lips, eyes, nose, ear, tongue – <i>Shambhavi, Kaki, Akashi, </i><i>Nasika Dristi, Shanmukhi, Khechari) </i></li>
<li>Bandha <i>(Jaalandhar, Uddiyan, Moola </i><i>and Maha) </i></li>
<li>Adhara Mudra (supporting mudras-<i>Aswini, Vrajoli </i>etc)</li>
<li>Hasta Mudra (mudras through hands- balance the </li>
<ul>
 <li><i>Mahabhootas  </i>like fire, water, air, earth and ether elements and </li>
<li><i>Tanmaatras </i>like taste, touch, smell and sound in the body and </li>
 <li><i>Doshas</i> in the body like <i>kapha </i>(phlegm),<i> pitta </i>(fire) and <i>vata </i>(air). </li>
 </ul>
 </ul>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Hasta Mudra (Hand mudra)</h2>
<p>The body is made up of 5 elements – Earth,  Water, Fire, Air and Ether. When these   five  elements are not in balance we get various  physical and psychological ailments.  The  energy from the body radiates out mainly  through the tip of the nose, lips, fingertips  and toes. When the thumb is brought in  contact with the other fingers, energy is  directed back to vitalize various parts of our  body. This is called a <i>circuit bypass</i>. Mudras  and Bhandas go hand in hand. Bandhas help  in locking in the energy, whereas mudras  help in redirecting the energy. </p>
<p>Mudras are the expression of our inner  feeling. In the Tantra shastra, Mudra is  defined as ‘<i>the one which gives happiness</i>’.  Mudras form a part of yoga and are together  referred to as <i>Yoga Mudra</i>. Mudras done  using hands are called <i>Hasta Mudra. </i>Indian  classical dances such as <i>Bharata Natyam, </i> <i>Yakshagana, Mohini Aattam, Kathakali, </i> <i>Kuchupudi, Oddissi </i>make use of mudras  to express their artforms. In the temples  deities show different mudras. Of those  the most well-known mudra is the <i>abhaya </i> mudra (reassuring mudra). In Tirupathi,  Balaji’s statue depicts that ‘if you surrender  to my feet, your problems are knee deep,  and you can easily walk through them.’ </p>
<p>The five fingers represent the five elements (tatvas): </p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb: Fire <i>(agni) </i></li>
<li>Index Finger: Air <i>(vayu) </i></li>
<li>Middle finger: Space <i>(akasha) </i></li>
<li>Ring Finger: Earth <i>(prithvi) </i></li>
<li>Small finger: Water <i>(jala) </i></li>
</ul>
<p>Fire is the most important of the five elements. When the fire element becomes weak in the body, various ailments come to the body. Through the practise of mudras the fire element (thumb) is joined with the other elements (other fingers) to vitalize those elements also. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Viparitakarini Mudra</h2>
<p><strong>&#10162; Meaning </strong></p>
<p><i>Viparitakarini  </i>is an inverted posture. In  fact  <i>Shirasasana  </i>and  <i>Sarvangasana  </i>are  also called <i>Viparitakarini</i>. The nectar  (<i>Amruta</i>) is continuously trickling down  from the Moon center at the Sahasrara  chakra and gets consumed in the sun  centre at the <i>manipura chakra</i>. The vitality  in the body exists as long as the nectar is  there in the Moon centre. Once the nectar  gets depleted, old age sets in. This mudra  revitalizes the Moon centre. </p>
<p><strong>&#9758;Benefits</strong></p>
<p>This posture is similar to <i>Sarvangasana </i> except that the throat muscles are not  constricted in this mudra. In this mudra,  the Sun centre which is located at <i>manipura </i> <i>chakra, </i>goes above the Moon centre which  is located at the head. Moon is called  <i>Soma</i>.  <i>Soma  </i>means Shiva. <i>Soma  </i>means  <i>Mukya Prana</i>.  <i>Prana</i>  levels in the body  increases. The digestive fire gets ignited.  This energizes the mind, slows down the  ageing process, slows down greying of hair,  removes wrinkles on the face and increases  the heart volume. It decompresses the  internal organs,rehydrates the discs, slows  down the heart rate, oxygenates the blood  and improves the Digestion. </p>
<p><strong>&#9881; Process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <i>Viparitakarani</i> we are reversing the position of sun and moon centres so that the Sun centre goes higher than Moon and starts energizing the Moon centre. </li>
<li>Lie down on your back and keep your hands beside the body. </li>
<li>With inhalation raise both feet above the ground. </li>
<li>Raise your waist up and support the back on your hands with the elbows on the ground. </li>
<li>Bring your toes in line with your eyes. </li>
<li>Do not throttle your neck muscles or apply any pressure on the neck muscles. </li>
<li>Breathe normally and hold this position for 1 minute and gradually increase the duration. </li>
<li>With exhalation slowly come down and relax. Please refer to Picture 206. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#9888; Caution</strong></p>
<p>People suffering from blood pressure, glaucoma, hernias, cardiovascular disease, cervical spondylitis, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis and kidney problems should not practice headstand. Those suffering from neck injuries should perform this kriya under supervision.</p>
