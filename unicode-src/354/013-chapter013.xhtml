<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kundalini Shakti</h2>
<p>The main <i>nadis Pingala, Ida </i>and  <i>Sushumna  </i>(relating respectively to the  sympathetic —activating nervous system,  the parasympathetic —relaxing nervous  system and the central — neutral nervous  system) run along the spinal column in a  double helix pattern and cross one another  several times. At the points of intersection,  they form strong energy centers known as  <i>chakras</i>. In the human body there are three  types of energy centres. The lower or animal  chakras are located in the region between  the toes and the pelvic region, indicating  our evolutionary animal origins. The human  chakras lie along the spinal column between  the base and the heart centre. Finally, the  higher or divine chakras are found between  the heart centre and the crown of the head.  The seven chakras which are useful to  <i>sadhaks  </i>(practitioners) are listed below.  Raising the energy from the <i>mooladhara </i> <i>chakra  </i>through  <i>the swadistana chakra, </i> <i>manipura chakra, anahata chakra, </i> <i>vishudda chakra, ajna chakra </i>and finally  to the <i>saahasrara chakra </i>is the purpose of  all  <i>sadhana</i> (practises) irrespective of the  path we take. </p>
<p>The Kundalini Shakti is also called <i>Shesha </i> <i>Shakti </i>(the serpent energy). <i>Adi Shesha </i>(bed  of <i>Lord Vishnu</i>) resides in us as a dormant  energy. This energy is like a coiled serpent  with its head turned down —indicating that  we have no sadhana, and our energy gets  dissipated in the lower aspects of our life.  It requires self-effort, proper guidance and  God’s Grace to uncoil, raise and channel this  <i>Shesha Shakti. </i>Without proper guidance,  doing sadhana may lead to psychic or  physiological problems. Raising the <i>Shesha </i> <i>Shakti  </i>from  <i>Mooladhara</i> to thousand  petaled <i>Sahasrara chakra </i>is the purpose of  the <i>sadhana</i>. When <i>Shesha Shakti reaches </i> <i>the Sahasrara chakra</i>, Adi Shesha opens  up his thousand hoods and the Lord dances  on the top of it. Then the yogi experiences  inexplicable joy within. When this happens  the Yogi’s karmas get burnt completely, and  he or she is no more bound by the coils of  karma. </p>
<p>The centre of the <i>Sahasrara chakra </i>is  called  <i>Brahma randra </i>(central opening).  We can feel the tender tissue in the crown  of babies. As the child grows this opening  closes. If the soul <i>(jiva)  </i>leaves the body  through this <i>Brahma randra, </i>then there  is no rebirth for that <i>jiva </i>(soul). When the  <i>jiva </i>(soul) gets liberated, it leaves the body  through this illumined path. The souls  which are bound to come back, depart the  body through other openings in the body  which are the non-illumined paths. </p>
<p>The location of each <i>chakra</i> along the  <i>Sushumna nadi</i> is given in Picture 216. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Mooladhara Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Kunda</i> means pit, <i>lini</i> means residing there.  <i>Kundalini </i>also means coil. It is a coiled up  energy. It is a potential energy. The purpose  of Yoga or any spiritual sadhana is to awaken  this kundalini energy  and to convert the  potential energy to kinetic energy. In Yoga  this potential energy is represented as the  serpent energy. This energy is at the base of  the spinal column at the tip of the tailbone  coccyx and is called the <i>mooladhara </i> <i>chakra</i>. This chakra is represented by four  petals, with three petals facing down and  one up. This is also represented as a serpent  coiled three and a half times, with its head  turned down. The three coils represent the  three gunas – <i>sattwa </i>(pure)<i>, rajas </i>(vibrant)  and  <i>tamas  </i>(dull). The head turned down  means, the general human tendency is to  go to lower consciousness. With <i>sadhana </i> (practise) we can raise our consciousness.  Like a lump of earth when dropped falls  down without effort, our consciousness  always goes downwards. </p>
<p>The ‘gonads’ are the ductless endocrine  glands. Endocrine glands secrete hormones  directly into the bloodstream. The gonads  control the reproductive organs. This  chakra represents ‘a sea of salt’ meaning  the world is of disappointment and pain.  The general tendency at the <i>mooladhara </i> level is sloth, laziness, malice and having  a destructive nature. Red is the colour of  the <i>mooladhara </i>chakra. The person at this  level of consciousness will be <i>tamasic </i>(dull)  in nature. Grossest of the elements, earth,  is the element here and the nature of earth  is smell, which is connected to <i>jnanedriya </i> (organ of knowledge), the nose. The earth  supports all other elements. </p>
<p>A firm foundation in <i>mooladhara </i>is needed  to raise our level higher. Asanas such as  <i>Kukkutasana, Utkatasana, Vajrasana, </i> <i>Padmasana, Siddasana</i>, mudras such as  <i>Aswini mudra</i>, bandhas such as <i>Moola </i> <i>bandha</i> helps in strengthening this  <i>Mooladhara</i>. The <i>Brahma Granti </i>(knot) is  located in this chakra. We need Ganesha’s  blessing to awaken our dormant energy  and he removes the obstacles in our path.  <i>Brahma </i>is the presiding deity of this chakra.  Brahma means big — earth is the biggest of  all elements. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Swadistana Chakra</h2>
<p>A couple of inches above the <i>mooladhara </i> along the spinal column, in the sacrum  region are six petaled <i>swadistana  </i>chakra.  <i>Swadistana </i>means the original place. The  ‘sea of sugarcane juice’ represented here  gives us worldly joy and comfort. Initially  our awareness is at this level and when the  <i>Shakti  </i>(energy) does not receive enough  support from <i>Purusha </i>(will power) it drops  down to the level of <i>mooladhara  </i>level.  Yellow is the colour of <i>swadistana</i>. Carnal  pleasure, worldly comfort and jealousy are  the attributes of this chakra. This person  will have the combination of <i>rajasic </i>(active)  and  <i>tamasic  </i>(dull) natures. Like water  flows down a slope, when consciousness  is located here it tends to flow downwards.  Water is the element in this chakra which is  subtler than earth. </p>
<p>The  <i>jnanedriya  </i>(organ of knowledge)  connected to this chakra is the tongue.  The suprarenal glands are located above  each kidney. They secrete hormones such  as aldosterone which regulates water and  electrolyte metabolism, and glucocorticoids  such as cortisol which help process  carbohydrates, glucose, protein, and fat. </p>
<p>The <i>Vishnu Granti </i>(knot) is located in this  chakra. Having control over the tongue and  carnal pleasure is not easy and piercing  <i>Vishnu Granti </i>is a very difficult sadhana.  With the blessings of a proper teacher, one  can move higher. </p>
<p>Asanas such as <i>Upavista Konasana, </i> <i>Paschimottasana, Janu Shirasasana, </i> <i>Vyagrasana</i>, mudras such as <i>Aswini</i>, and  bandhas such as <i>Udyan bandha</i>, pranayama  such as <i>Bastrika</i>, help in awakening and  moving our consciousness higher. <i>Vishnu </i> is the presiding deity of the <i>swadistana </i> chakra. <i>Vishnu </i>means <i>vishati </i>or <i>pravishati </i> meaning ‘spreading everywhere’. Water  pervades everywhere. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Manipura Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Manipura  </i>means ‘jewel city’. Behind the  navel in the abdominal region is the solar  plexus, the <i>manipura  </i>chakra. Like the  flame always points upwards so does the  awareness here. The adrenal glands are  located in this region. The adrenals secrete  hormones in response to stress and anxiety.  These glands control blood volume in the  body. The <i>jnanedriya </i>(organ of knowledge)  connected to this chakra are the eyes. </p>
<p>Orange is the colour of this chakra and is  represented with ten petals. The ‘sea of  spirit’ is the nature of this chakra, which is  intoxicating. People become obsessed with  things, become workaholic and work long  hours but only for personal gratification.  A person will be highly <i>rajasic </i>(vibrant) in  nature. Greed and anger are associated with  this chakra. The Sun centre is located here  and controls the intellect. Here the flame  is covered with smoke and it is difficult  for people to get along with person of this  nature. </p>
<p>Asanas  such as <i>Navasana, </i> <i>Paschimottasana, Upavista Konasana, </i> <i>Vajrasana, Agnisara kriya, Nauli </i> <i>kriya, Uddayan bandha, Aswini mudra</i>,  pranayamas such as <i>Kapalabhati</i> and  <i>Bastrika</i> will be beneficial in awakening  this energy centre and to move higher. </p>
<p><i>Rudra  </i>is the presiding deity of <i>Manipura </i> chakra. <i>Rudra </i>means ‘one which makes us  cry.’ Fire burns and makes us cry. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Anahata Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Anahata </i>means non vibratory sound, inner  sound. One can hear this when one is at  peace and in quietude. This is located behind  the heart in the thoracic region in the centre  of the thymus gland. This thymus gland is  in the shape of a downward folded red  coloured lotus. Its function is to regenerate  the body and control the immune system.  The thymus gland weighs about 24 grams  in children and its weight reduces to half in  adults. </p>
<p><i>Anahata</i> chakra has twelve green petals.  This is the ‘sea of butter or ghee’ which  represents devotion. At this point, a  person becomes selfless and sees the all  pervasive Lord. <i>Narayana Sookta </i>says  <i>padma kosha prateekasham-hridaym-</i> <i>chapyadhomukham</i>.  <i>Tasyante-sushiram-</i> <i>sookshmam-tasmin sarvam pratistitam</i>— folded red lotus with head turned down  is located in the heart centre. Within that,  there is a small space which is smaller than  the tip of the needle where everything is  there. Yogis meditate on this region which  is the place of Lord Vasudeva, <i>Prana</i>, all  presiding deities <i>(tatvabhimani devatas) </i> and the <i>jiva</i>. Meditating here one obtains  everything. Air is the element here, which  is subtler than fire. Air is connected to this  <i>jnanedriya </i>(organ of knowledge) the skin,  which controls the feeling of touch. </p>
<p>Asanas such as <i>Bhujangasana, Matsy-</i> <i>asana, Setu bandha, Dhanurasana, </i> <i>Paschimottasana, Nadishodana prana-</i> <i>yama, Kapalabhati, Bastrika, Udyan </i> <i>bandha</i> help in awakening this energy  centre.  <i>Shiva  </i>is the presiding deity at the  <i>anahata  </i>chakra.  <i>Shiva</i> means pure. Air  purifies everything. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Vishudda Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Visha shudda </i>means ‘poison filtering  chakra’. This chakra has sixteen blue petals.  The thyroid and parathyroid glands are  located here in cervical region at the root  of the tongue. The thyroid and parathyroid  glands are the biggest endocrine glands.  The thyroid glands play an important role  in foetal and early childhood development.  These glands also control calcium levels in  the blood. </p>
<p>Ether is the element, and the nature of  ether is sound, which is connected to the  <i>jnanedriya </i>(organ of knowledge), the ears.  <i>Pradyumna  </i>(one who controls our dream  phase) is located here, and we go through  this centre during our dream phase. This  chakra is the ‘sea of butter milk’(or yoghurt),  which represents <i>vairagya </i>(dispassion) for  worldly things and attachment to the noble  things in life. </p>
<p>Asanas such as <i>Matsyasana, Bhujangasana, </i> <i>Dhanurasana, Sarvangasana</i>, mudras  such as <i>Akashi, Kechari</i> and bandhas  such as <i>Jalandhara</i> and pranayama such  as  <i>Kapalabhati</i> and <i>Ujjayi</i> are good for  awakening this energy centre. <i>Sada Shiva </i>is  the presiding deity of the <i>vishudda </i>chakra.  <i>Sada Shiva </i>means one who is always pure.  Ether never gets polluted. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Ajna Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Ajna </i>means ‘command’. Here the Supreme Lord operates during the wakeful stage  in the form of <i>Anirudda</i>. This is located  between the eyebrows, closer to the right  eye. The pineal gland is located here. This  is the seat of the Moon which controls  intuition, insight and inner direction  (<i>vijnana —vishesha jnana). </i>This chakra is  represented by two indigo coloured lotus  petals. The ‘sea of milk’ is represented in  this chakra. </p>
<p>The  <i>Rudra granthi </i>(knot) is also located  here. </p>
<p>Asanas such as <i>Shashankasana, </i> <i>Balasana, Vrischikasana, Shalabhasana, </i> <i>Viparitakarini</i> and pranayama such as  <i>Bastrika</i>,  <i>Kapalabhati</i>,  <i>Brahmari</i> and  mudras such as <i>Shanmukhi</i> and <i>Tratak </i> <i>kriya</i> is beneficial to awaken this energy  centre. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Sahasrara Chakra</h2>
<p><i>Sahas </i>means ‘thousand’, <i>ara </i>means ‘spokes  or petals’. A thousand-petaled violet lotus  flower is represented here. This is located  in the crown centre and extends beyond  the crown centre by twelve inches. <i>Amruta </i> (nectar) – the ‘sea of nectar’ is located here.  The pituitary gland which is the king of  glands is connected with this chakra. This  gland makes other glands function properly.  The purpose of yoga or any sadhana is to  raise our awareness from the <i>mooladhara </i> to  <i>sahasrara</i>. Here the individual soul  reaches its supreme goal – <i>Sat Chit Ananda </i> (knowledge and bliss personified)<i>. </i>The yogi  who reaches this level and leaves the body  through this chakra, which is the path of no  return as the Vedas say, he or she reaches  <i>tad Vishno paramam padam </i>– the feet  of the Lord. The person who reaches this  level experiences inexplicable bliss within,  and starts radiating peace. The person who  reaches this level feels the nectar trickling  down from <i>sahasrara </i>drenching the whole  body. That person who reaches this level  becomes like a walking temple, distributing  peace and joy wherever he or she goes. </p>
<p>Asanas  such as <i>Shirasasana, </i> <i>Sarvangasana, Maha mudra, Maha </i> <i>bandha, Kechari, Bastrika</i> helps in raising  consciousness to this level. The Lord  Himself is the presiding deity here and the  yogi leaving the body through this chakra  reaches the Lord. </p>
