			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Kundalini Shakti</h2>
			<p>The main <em>nadis Pingala, Ida</em> and <em>Sushumna</em> (relating respectively to the sympathetic —activating nervous system, the parasympathetic —relaxing nervous system and the central — neutral nervous system) run along the spinal column in a double helix pattern and cross one another several times. At the points of intersection, they form strong energy centers known as <em>chakras</em>. In the human body there are three types of energy centres. The lower or animal chakras are located in the region between the toes and the pelvic region, indicating our evolutionary animal origins. The human chakras lie along the spinal column between the base and the heart centre. Finally, the higher or divine chakras are found between the heart centre and the crown of the head. The seven chakras which are useful to <em>sadhaks</em> (practitioners) are listed below. Raising the energy from the <em>mooladhara chakra</em> through <em>the swadistana chakra, manipura chakra, anahata chakra, vishudda chakra, ajna chakra</em> and finally to the <em>saahasrara chakra</em> is the purpose of all <em>sadhana</em> (practises) irrespective of the path we take.</p>
			<p>The Kundalini Shakti is also called <em>Shesha Shakti</em> (the serpent energy). <em>Adi Shesha</em> (bed of <em>Lord Vishnu</em>) resides in us as a dormant energy. This energy is like a coiled serpent with its head turned down —indicating that we have no sadhana, and our energy gets dissipated in the lower aspects of our life. It requires self-effort, proper guidance and God’s Grace to uncoil, raise and channel this <em>Shesha Shakti.</em> Without proper guidance, doing sadhana may lead to psychic or physiological problems. Raising the <em>Shesha Shakti</em> from <em>Mooladhara</em> to thousand petaled <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> is the purpose of the <em>sadhana</em>. When <em>Shesha Shakti reaches the Sahasrara chakra</em>, Adi Shesha opens up his thousand hoods and the Lord dances on the top of it. Then the yogi experiences inexplicable joy within. When this happens the Yogi’s karmas get burnt completely, and he or she is no more bound by the coils of karma.</p>
			<p>The centre of the <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> is called <em>Brahma randra</em> (central opening). We can feel the tender tissue in the crown of babies. As the child grows this opening closes. If the soul <em>(jiva)</em> leaves the body through this <em>Brahma randra,</em> then there is no rebirth for that <em>jiva</em> (soul). When the <em>jiva</em> (soul) gets liberated, it leaves the body through this illumined path. The souls which are bound to come back, depart the body through other openings in the body which are the non-illumined paths.</p>
			<p>The location of each <em>chakra</em> along the <em>Sushumna nadi</em> is given in Picture 216.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Mooladhara Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Kunda</em> means pit, <em>lini</em> means residing there. <em>Kundalini</em> also means coil. It is a coiled up energy. It is a potential energy. The purpose of Yoga or any spiritual sadhana is to awaken this kundalini energy and to convert the potential energy to kinetic energy. In Yoga this potential energy is represented as the serpent energy. This energy is at the base of the spinal column at the tip of the tailbone coccyx and is called the <em>mooladhara chakra</em>. This chakra is represented by four petals, with three petals facing down and one up. This is also represented as a serpent coiled three and a half times, with its head turned down. The three coils represent the three gunas – <em>sattwa</em> (pure)<em>, rajas</em> (vibrant) and <em>tamas</em> (dull). The head turned down means, the general human tendency is to go to lower consciousness. With <em>sadhana</em> (practise) we can raise our consciousness. Like a lump of earth when dropped falls down without effort, our consciousness always goes downwards.</p>
			<p>The ‘gonads’ are the ductless endocrine glands. Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. The gonads control the reproductive organs. This chakra represents ‘a sea of salt’ meaning the world is of disappointment and pain. The general tendency at the <em>mooladhara</em> level is sloth, laziness, malice and having a destructive nature. Red is the colour of the <em>mooladhara</em> chakra. The person at this level of consciousness will be <em>tamasic</em> (dull) in nature. Grossest of the elements, earth, is the element here and the nature of earth is smell, which is connected to <em>jnanedriya</em> (organ of knowledge), the nose. The earth supports all other elements.</p>
			<p>A firm foundation in <em>mooladhara</em> is needed to raise our level higher. Asanas such as <em>Kukkutasana, Utkatasana, Vajrasana, Padmasana, Siddasana</em>, mudras such as <em>Aswini mudra</em>, bandhas such as <em>Moola bandha</em> helps in strengthening this <em>Mooladhara</em>. The <em>Brahma Granti</em> (knot) is located in this chakra. We need Ganesha’s blessing to awaken our dormant energy and he removes the obstacles in our path. <em>Brahma</em> is the presiding deity of this chakra. Brahma means big — earth is the biggest of all elements.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Swadistana Chakra</h2>
			<p>A couple of inches above the <em>mooladhara</em> along the spinal column, in the sacrum region are six petaled <em>swadistana</em> chakra. <em>Swadistana</em> means the original place. The ‘sea of sugarcane juice’ represented here gives us worldly joy and comfort. Initially our awareness is at this level and when the <em>Shakti</em> (energy) does not receive enough support from <em>Purusha</em> (will power) it drops down to the level of <em>mooladhara</em> level. Yellow is the colour of <em>swadistana</em>. Carnal pleasure, worldly comfort and jealousy are the attributes of this chakra. This person will have the combination of <em>rajasic</em> (active) and <em>tamasic</em> (dull) natures. Like water flows down a slope, when consciousness is located here it tends to flow downwards. Water is the element in this chakra which is subtler than earth.</p>
			<p>The <em>jnanedriya</em> (organ of knowledge) connected to this chakra is the tongue. The suprarenal glands are located above each kidney. They secrete hormones such as aldosterone which regulates water and electrolyte metabolism, and glucocorticoids such as cortisol which help process carbohydrates, glucose, protein, and fat.</p>
			<p>The <em>Vishnu Granti</em> (knot) is located in this chakra. Having control over the tongue and carnal pleasure is not easy and piercing <em>Vishnu Granti</em> is a very difficult sadhana. With the blessings of a proper teacher, one can move higher.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Upavista Konasana, Paschimottasana, Janu Shirasasana, Vyagrasana</em>, mudras such as <em>Aswini</em>, and bandhas such as <em>Udyan bandha</em>, pranayama such as <em>Bastrika</em>, help in awakening and moving our consciousness higher. <em>Vishnu</em> is the presiding deity of the <em>swadistana</em> chakra. <em>Vishnu</em> means <em>vishati</em> or <em>pravishati</em> meaning ‘spreading everywhere’. Water pervades everywhere.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Manipura Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Manipura</em> means ‘jewel city’. Behind the navel in the abdominal region is the solar plexus, the <em>manipura</em> chakra. Like the flame always points upwards so does the awareness here. The adrenal glands are located in this region. The adrenals secrete hormones in response to stress and anxiety. These glands control blood volume in the body. The <em>jnanedriya</em> (organ of knowledge) connected to this chakra are the eyes.</p>
			<p>Orange is the colour of this chakra and is represented with ten petals. The ‘sea of spirit’ is the nature of this chakra, which is intoxicating. People become obsessed with things, become workaholic and work long hours but only for personal gratification. A person will be highly <em>rajasic</em> (vibrant) in nature. Greed and anger are associated with this chakra. The Sun centre is located here and controls the intellect. Here the flame is covered with smoke and it is difficult for people to get along with person of this nature.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Navasana, Paschimottasana, Upavista Konasana, Vajrasana, Agnisara kriya, Nauli kriya, Uddayan bandha, Aswini mudra</em>, pranayamas such as <em>Kapalabhati</em> and <em>Bastrika</em> will be beneficial in awakening this energy centre and to move higher.</p>
			<p><em>Rudra</em> is the presiding deity of <em>Manipura</em> chakra. <em>Rudra</em> means ‘one which makes us cry.’ Fire burns and makes us cry.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Anahata Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Anahata</em> means non vibratory sound, inner sound. One can hear this when one is at peace and in quietude. This is located behind the heart in the thoracic region in the centre of the thymus gland. This thymus gland is in the shape of a downward folded red coloured lotus. Its function is to regenerate the body and control the immune system. The thymus gland weighs about 24 grams in children and its weight reduces to half in adults.</p>
			<p><em>Anahata</em> chakra has twelve green petals. This is the ‘sea of butter or ghee’ which represents devotion. At this point, a person becomes selfless and sees the all pervasive Lord. <em>Narayana Sookta</em> says <em>padma kosha prateekasham-hridaym- chapyadhomukham</em>. <em>Tasyante-sushiram- sookshmam-tasmin sarvam pratistitam</em>— folded red lotus with head turned down is located in the heart centre. Within that, there is a small space which is smaller than the tip of the needle where everything is there. Yogis meditate on this region which is the place of Lord Vasudeva, <em>Prana</em>, all presiding deities <em>(tatvabhimani devatas)</em> and the <em>jiva</em>. Meditating here one obtains everything. Air is the element here, which is subtler than fire. Air is connected to this <em>jnanedriya</em> (organ of knowledge) the skin, which controls the feeling of touch.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Bhujangasana, Matsy- asana, Setu bandha, Dhanurasana, Paschimottasana, Nadishodana prana- yama, Kapalabhati, Bastrika, Udyan bandha</em> help in awakening this energy centre. <em>Shiva</em> is the presiding deity at the <em>anahata</em> chakra. <em>Shiva</em> means pure. Air purifies everything.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Vishudda Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Visha shudda</em> means ‘poison filtering chakra’. This chakra has sixteen blue petals. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located here in cervical region at the root of the tongue. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are the biggest endocrine glands. The thyroid glands play an important role in foetal and early childhood development. These glands also control calcium levels in the blood.</p>
			<p>Ether is the element, and the nature of ether is sound, which is connected to the <em>jnanedriya</em> (organ of knowledge), the ears. <em>Pradyumna</em> (one who controls our dream phase) is located here, and we go through this centre during our dream phase. This chakra is the ‘sea of butter milk’(or yoghurt), which represents <em>vairagya</em> (dispassion) for worldly things and attachment to the noble things in life.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Matsyasana, Bhujangasana, Dhanurasana, Sarvangasana</em>, mudras such as <em>Akashi, Kechari</em> and bandhas such as <em>Jalandhara</em> and pranayama such as <em>Kapalabhati</em> and <em>Ujjayi</em> are good for awakening this energy centre. <em>Sada Shiva</em> is the presiding deity of the <em>vishudda</em> chakra. <em>Sada Shiva</em> means one who is always pure. Ether never gets polluted.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Ajna Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Ajna</em> means ‘command’. Here the Supreme Lord operates during the wakeful stage in the form of <em>Anirudda</em>. This is located between the eyebrows, closer to the right eye. The pineal gland is located here. This is the seat of the Moon which controls intuition, insight and inner direction (<em>vijnana —vishesha jnana).</em> This chakra is represented by two indigo coloured lotus petals. The ‘sea of milk’ is represented in this chakra.</p>
			<p>The <em>Rudra granthi</em> (knot) is also located here.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Shashankasana, Balasana, Vrischikasana, Shalabhasana, Viparitakarini</em> and pranayama such as <em>Bastrika, Kapalabhati, Brahmari</em> and mudras such as <em>Shanmukhi</em> and <em>Tratak kriya</em> is beneficial to awaken this energy centre.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">The Sahasrara Chakra</h2>
			<p><em>Sahas</em> means ‘thousand’, <em>ara</em> means ‘spokes or petals’. A thousand-petaled violet lotus flower is represented here. This is located in the crown centre and extends beyond the crown centre by twelve inches. <em>Amruta</em> (nectar) – the ‘sea of nectar’ is located here. The pituitary gland which is the king of glands is connected with this chakra. This gland makes other glands function properly. The purpose of yoga or any sadhana is to raise our awareness from the <em>mooladhara</em> to <em>sahasrara</em>. Here the individual soul reaches its supreme goal – <em>Sat Chit Ananda</em> (knowledge and bliss personified). The yogi who reaches this level and leaves the body through this chakra, which is the path of no return as the Vedas say, he or she reaches <em>tad Vishno paramam padam</em> – the feet of the Lord. The person who reaches this level experiences inexplicable bliss within, and starts radiating peace. The person who reaches this level feels the nectar trickling down from <em>sahasrara</em> drenching the whole body. That person who reaches this level becomes like a walking temple, distributing peace and joy wherever he or she goes.</p>
			<p>Asanas such as <em>Shirasasana, Sarvangasana, Maha mudra, Maha, bandha, Kechari, Bastrika</em> helps in raising consciousness to this level. The Lord Himself is the presiding deity here and the yogi leaving the body through this chakra reaches the Lord.</p>
