		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi</h1>
		<p>Meditation means <em>manana, dhyana</em>. <em>Dhyana</em> means single pointed attention. Meditation confirms what the mind thinks. If I think negative and meditate upon it, it confirms and validates my negative thinking. If I think positive, it confirms and validates my positive thinking. By single pointed meditation, one’s energy builds and <em>siddhi</em> or perfection is obtained. <em>Siddhi</em> does not mean that the person knows Truth. The scriptures say that before we do any meditation, we need to be clear about the goal. We need to continuously read or hear about noble ideals, goals, think about them and then meditate upon them. The scriptures call this process <em>sravana</em> (hearing), <em>manana</em> (contemplating) and <em>nidhidyasana</em> (experiencing). In deeper meditation, even the mind stops and only the self operates. This is known as <em>unmani bhava</em> or <em>samadhi</em>.</p>
		<p><em>Agni Purana</em> says that there is no purifier like <em>dhyana,</em> which purifies all our negative karmas. Meditation happens in two phases —the mental and beyond the mental level. <em>Dhyana</em> means single pointed thinking on our object of contemplation. Whenever our mind wanders away from our object of contemplation, bringing it back is called <em>dhyana</em>. This is at the mental level. <em>Agni Purana</em> says ‘at the mental level of dhyana, one should think of Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent Vishnu’.</p>
		<p>In the next stage of meditation the mind stops, and in Yoga it is called as <em>unmani bhava</em> or <em>samadhi</em>. In deep sleep our mind also stops functioning. Stopping the mind when we are awake and aware is meditation. When we say ’I am meditating on God during</p>
		<p>meditation, we need to try to find out who this ’I‘ is. When we know ‘who I am’, this is self realization, which is the first step towards God realization. When we realize this, then Self starts functioning and it experiences nothing but our true nature — ‘bliss’.</p>
		<p>When the self-realized person realizes that the same Self pervades everywhere, it is called God realization. The self- realized person knows that he or she did not create the mind or body. When the self realized person realizes that there is something beyond, which is <em>Deshataha ananta</em> (existing in all places), <em>Kalataha ananta</em> (existing in all times), <em>Gunataha ananta</em> (existing with all noble attributes), <em>Shaktitaha ananta</em> (Omni potent), this is called ’God realization’. This leads to the inner <em>dharshan</em> (vision) of the God, or God realization. The <em>Agni Purana</em> says that when we have the <em>dharshan</em> of <em>Hari</em>remover of all our negativitiesall our <em>paapasam harati</em> —‘all our karmas get burnt up.’</p>
		<p>The scriptures say that the bliss one experiences in self realization is immense, but in God realization it is infinite. The process of increasing our bliss is in the inward journey and not in the outward journey.</p>
		<p>The process of deep sleep and meditation is similar. In deep sleep, there is an awareness of self, an awareness of bliss and an awareness of our inner clock. When we get up from deep sleep we say ’I‘ slept blissfully from last night to this morning but we realize this bliss only when we get up from sleep, not while we are in deep sleep. Every one of us wants to experience this bliss, that is the main reason we go to sleep. But, we go to sleep ignorant and get up ignorant without any inner awakening.</p>
		<p>Like in deep sleep, in meditation also, there is an awareness of Self, an awareness of bliss and an awareness of our inner clock, but we experience this in the seat of meditation. We always come out enriched from meditation, unlike sleep. Awareness of our sleeping process in the wakeful state is meditation. In meditation, the pineal gland get activated and our intuition ability increases, our creativity increases. We grow wiser after each meditation.</p>
		<p>The process of the inward journey comes in four stages: Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Pratyahara</h2>
			<p><em>Pratyahara</em> means ‘withdrawal’. This is not a forceful withdrawal. As we practise asanas, pranayama, kriyas and yoga nidra while observing <em>yama</em> and <em>niyama</em>, the mind naturally becomes introverted and elevated. The mind no longer seeks outer objects of happiness because it starts seeing higher happiness within.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Yoga Nidra</h2>
			<p><em>Yoga Nidra</em> is one of the processes of pratyahara. <em>Yoga Nidra</em> is a Tantric technique we use to calm the body, emotions and mind. Even when we sleep, our mind is active and sometimes we get up very tired. Tiredness cannot be overcome by sleep alone. Sometimes we sleep for a whole day and still feel tired. Generally we go to sleep without resolving our tensions and stresses, and these in turn go into our psyche and often come back to haunt us with a psychic or mental condition. <em>Yoga Nidra</em> is dynamic sleep – <em>satwic</em> (pure) sleep. Whereas normal sleep is <em>tamasic</em> (dull, <em>Yoga Nidra</em> is a psychic sleep wherein we consciously resolve the tension held in each part of the body. History says that Napoleon in the middle of the battlefield used to withdraw and go into 20 minutes of <em>Yyoga Nidra</em>, then return to the battle field fully charged.</p>
			<p><em>Yoga Nidra</em> is the key to success for many great people. Though they are extremely busy, they accomplish many tasks in a single lifespan, which is unthinkable to an ordinary person.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While we are awake —brain waves oscillate at Beta frequency (13—20 cps).</li>
				<li>In <em>Yoga Nidra</em>, the super conscious mind (the fourth stage – <em>turiya</em>, and borderline state between wakefulness and deep sleep) , brain waves decrease to Alpha level (8—12 cps).</li>
				<li>In the dream state (subconscious level) ,the brain waves lower to Theta level (4—7 cps).</li>
				<li>In deep sleep (unconscious level) ,brain activity drops to Delta level (0—4 cps).</li>
				<li><em>Benefits:</em> In normal sleep only the <em>annamaya kosha</em> (physical sheath) becomes rejuvenated, whereas in <em>Yoga Nidra</em> all 5 layers of our personality, starting from the <em>annamaya kosha</em> (physical sheath), <em>pranamaya kosha</em> (breath sheath), <em>manomaya kosha</em> (intellectual sheath), <em>vijnanamaya kosha</em> (intuitional sheath) to <em>ananadamaya kosha</em> (bliss sheath) get rejuvenated. Twenty minutes of <em>Yoga Nidra</em> is like 2 hours of deep sleep and this rejuvenates the body and mind.</li>
				<li><em>Process:</em> Lie down on your back with the feet and hands spread apart and palms facing upwards.</li>
				<li>If you are feeling cold pull a blanket over you.</li>
				<li>Be aware of your breathing.</li>
				<li>With inhalation feel the abdomen going up and chest expanding.</li>
				<li>With exhalation feel the chest contracting followed by the stomach.</li>
				<li>Try not to go to sleep.</li>
				<li>In <em>Yoga Nidra</em> you are mentally awake and physically asleep.</li>
				<li>In <em>Yoga Nidra</em> you will go through over 100 parts of your body and mentally touch these parts.</li>
				<li>Mentally pass your energy on to these parts.</li>
				<li>Slowly move your attention to right leg parts, left leg parts, right hand parts, left hand parts, torso, spinal column parts, face, and internal organ parts in sequence as given in the Table below.</li>
				<li>Gently be aware of your breathing.</li>
				<li>Wriggle your fingers and toes.</li>
				<li>Rub your palms together and warm your face muscles with the palms.</li>
				<li>Gently open your eyes.</li>
				<li>Roll to your right and gently sit up.</li>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Dharana</h2>
			<p><em>Dharana</em> means ‘holding the mind’s attention within the awareness’. In the initial stages of <em>sadhana</em> the mind seeks happiness outside even when it experiences the higher happiness within. By continued <em>sadhana</em>, the mind stops seeking happiness outside and can be turned inwards, to enjoy the bliss within for a long period of time.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="level2 numbered" id="id-014.04">
			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Dhyana</h2>
			<p>Continuous flow of thoughts to the Lord within the heart is <em>dhyana</em>. In Shrimad Bhagawat Gita, Shri Krishna explains the process of <em>dhyana</em> as:</p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Samam kaya shirogrivam<br /> dharayan achalam stiraha<br />Samprekya Nasikagram swam<br />dhishachana avalokayan BG 6.13</em></p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Prashanta atma vigatabhi<br /> brahmachari vrate stitaha<br /> Mana samyamya macchitto<br /> yukta aaseeta matparaha BG 6.14</em></p>
			<p>‘Keeping the body, neck and head in one line sit without movement. Gaze at the tip of your nose and without looking anywhere. With a pleasant mind without fear, steadfast in <em>brahmachari vrata</em>, subduing the mind, think of the Lord alone as the highest goal.’</p>
			<p>In <em>dhyana</em> (meditation) the mind carves a picture we would like to see within. What we see in <em>dhyana</em> (meditation) need not be the Truth because it may be a creation of our mind. Mind just confirms our belief. The purpose of <em>dhyana</em> is to go beyond the realm of the mind and allow <em>swarupa</em> (our own true nature) to function. <em>Dhyana</em> helps us to tap into our own true nature, <em>jnana anada swarupa</em>—our true nature — knowledge and bliss.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Samadhi</h2>
			<p>The processes of sleep and meditation are the same. In both cases, our soul makes contact with ’Self of all‘ – the Lord. The only difference is that in sleep we are not aware that we are in contact with the Lord, while in meditation we are aware that we are in contact with the Lord. Our soul gets nourishment from the Supreme. In deep sleep our soul embraces the Supreme and gets nourishment. That is why sleep deprivation weakens a person and makes him or her vulnerable and weak.</p>
			<p>In normal life we experience only three <em>avastas</em>—<em>jagrat</em> (wakeful)<em>, swapna</em> (dream)<em>, sushupti</em> (deep sleep), and this is common to all animals. In <em>chaturmurthi upasana</em> (the four stage sadhana), the Lord in the form of <em>Anirudda</em> illumines our wakeful state from <em>ajna chakra</em>. Lord in the form of <em>Pradyumna</em> takes us to dream state and operates from <em>vishudda chakra.</em> Lord in the form of <em>Sankarashana</em> takes us to deep sleep stage and operates from <em>anahata chakra</em>. We go to sleep ignorant and get up ignorant.</p>
			<p>There is a fourth state and the <em>rishis</em> (sages) have called this <em>turiya</em> (the fourth one)<em></em> or <em>unmani bhava</em>. The sages say that <em>turiya</em> is the true wakeful state to the reality and that the other three states <em>of jagrat, swapna</em> and <em>supti</em> are all sleep phases. To get to this <em>turiya</em> stage sadhana (intense practise) is required. Like a normal person longs for and enjoys sleep, a person who has tasted the <em>turiya</em> state longs for more of this experience. The indweller of all Lord Vasudeva — a giver of liberation takes us to the <em>turiya</em> state in the heart centre — <em>anahata chakra.</em> When this happens an immense joy dawns and it is reflected as <em>ojas</em> (radiance) in the face of the <em>sadhak.</em> In this state we see a flash or form of our chosen ideal. <em>Shrimad Bhagawatam</em> says that this flash does not last long but only for a quarter of a <em>matra</em> time (<em>matra</em> is the time required to say a syllable). Reaching the fourth stage <em>turiya or unmani bhava</em> (beyond the horizon of mind) is the ultimate aim of Yoga. The person who reaches this state is always in happiness, joy and bliss for no reason and irrespective of outer circumstances.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Vasudeva Kriya</h2>
			<p>There is an ancient science of pranic body rhythms which explains how the movement of <em>Prana</em> can be controlled by manipulation of the breath. This Science is called <em>Swara Yoga</em>. More information on this is available in <em>Tantric</em> texts which are a part of <em>Atharva veda. Atharva veda</em> has twelve <em>shakhas</em> (branches) and these twelve <em>shakhas</em> are represented through 12 lettered Mantra (<em>dwadasha akshara mantra</em>) Om Namo Bhagawate Vasudevaya.</p>
			<p>Patanjali says <em>tapas, swadyaya</em> and <em>ishwara pranidaana</em> together is <em>kriya yoga</em>. Vasudeva Kriya is a mantra, pranayama and dhyana combined in one. Vasudeva Kriya is with <em>bhahya vritti pranayama</em> (focus on the exhale). This type of breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This type of pranayama strengthens the heart muscles, slows down the breathing rate, increases the lifespan, relaxes the mind, makes the mind creative, enables one to develop intuition, insights, and above all, every breath is synchronized with the twelve syllable divine maha mantra Om Namo Bhagawate Vasudevaya. In Vasudeva Kriya you are inhaling with three syllable Om —A, U, and M and exhaling through twelve syllable Om Namo Bhagawate Vasudevaya. This way you are activating the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
			<p>Vasudeva Kriya Yoga, however, should not be confused with pranayama, which involves a different aspect of breath. Although both deal with <em>Pprana</em>, Vasudeva Kriya emphasizes the analysis of breath and the significance of different <em>pranic</em> rhythms. Whereas, pranayama involves techniques to redirect, store and control <em>Pprana</em>. Vasudeva Kriya Yoga not only involves all practises of pranayama, but it is a much more intensive and precise technique.</p>
			<p>Breathing goes deeper than the lungs. Breathing not only helps in maintaining the physical body, but also helps in the evolution of consciousness. Beyond the physical body the energy body exits. Beyond the energy body the mind exists, beyond the mind the intellect exists, beyond the intellect consciousness exists and beyond this is super consciousness. This is mentioned in Bhagawat Gita as:</p>
			<p><em>Indriyani Paranyahu Indriyebhyaha Param Manaha Manatastu Para Buddhir- yo Buddhehe Paratastu Saha B.G. 3.42</em></p>
			<p>When we breath, a flow of energy is created in the body. This flow is called <em>nadi</em> in yoga. In the nostrils three different flows of energy are created —<em>ida</em>, <em>pingala</em> and <em>sushumna</em>. The left nostril is connected to <em>ida</em>, the right nostril to <em>pingala</em> and when both nostril function together, the central <em>nadi sushumna</em> is stimulated.</p>
			<p>When the breath goes through the left nostril <em>(ida),</em> the mind <em>(chitta)</em> get’s activated<em>.</em> The c<em>hitta</em> controls <em>jnanendriyas</em> (the organs of knowledge)—eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. When the breath flows through the right nostril <em>(pingala),</em> the body get’s activated. This intern activates <em>karmendriyas-</em> hand, legs, speech, reproductive and excretory organs. When both nostrils (chitta and body) operates together, the spiritual energy is activated.</p>
			<p>To put it in another way, while meditating if the right nostril <em>(pingala)</em> is active, the body become’s restless on the other hand while meditating if the left nostril <em>(ida)</em> is active, the mind become’s restless. However, when both <em>ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> are active, the s<em>ushumna nadi</em> become active and the mind becomes one pointed. Thus Vasudeva Kriya aims at harmonizing body and mind by adjusting the breath to achieve one-pointedness in the mind.</p>
			<p><em>Sushumna nadi</em> is the cause of spiritual experience and the purpose of every <em>satwic</em> sadhana is to activate it. The <em>sushumna</em> runs straight up the centre of the spine and merges with <em>ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> at the <em>Sahasrara chakra</em>. It is through this <em>Sushumna nadi</em> that <em>kundalini shakti</em> has to be channelized. When the <em>sushumna</em> flows, the mental and physical energy becomes even and rhythmic (one hears inner sound—<em>nada</em> or <em>swara</em>), thoughts are stilled and the mind becomes calm. For a yogi this <em>nada</em> or <em>swara</em> helps in <em>dhyana</em> or meditation. The aim of Vasudeva Kriya Yoga is to develop this type of breathing by reducing the activities of the alternating nostrils.</p>
			<p>This Vasudeva Kriya makes the breathing slow and steady. Vasudeva Kriya infuses the <em>Prana shakti</em> (energy level) in the body. In Vasudeva Kriya no breath is wasted without a divine name. By practising this, mind automatically goes into <em>ajapa japa</em> (spontaneous repetition of the Lord’s name). This is the very purpose of all spiritual sadhana, of irrespective of the path we take. In the 8th chapter of Bhagawat</p>
			<p>Gita Shri Krishna says,</p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Antakale cha mameva<br /> smaran muktva kalevaram<br /> yaha prayati sa madbhavam<br /> yaati nastyatra samshayaha B.G. 8.5</em></p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Yam yam vaapi smaran bhavam<br /> tyajatyante kalevaram<br /> tam tamevaiti kauteya<br /> sadaa tadbhava bhavitaha B.G. 8.6</em></p>
			<p class="verse"><em>Tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu<br /> mamanusmara yudyacha<br /> mayyarpita manobuddhi<br /> mamaivaishya asamshayam B.G. 8.7</em></p>
			<p>‘He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains my state’; there is no doubt about it. Kaunteya, whatever you think of at the last minute of your life and leave the body that alone you attain, being ever absorbed in that thought. Therefore all the time think of me and fight the battle of life. With mind and reason thus set on Me, you will doubtlessly come to Me.</p>
			<p>The Supreme indweller of all is not limited to only one name and only one form. The Supreme indweller, Light of all Lights, has all the names and all the forms. Whatever form and name we worship Him, it reaches Him alone. This is like rain water ultimately reaching the ocean, all our prayers ultimately reaches the Supreme Lord.</p>
			<p><em>Vasa</em> means resides in heart. <em>Deva</em> means Supreme being. Vasudeva means, the Lord resides in everyone’s heart as a Supreme being to illumine our path.</p>
			<p><em>Vasu</em> means pure mind. <em>Deva</em> means illumine. Vasudeva means, He reveals Himself to those who have a pure mind.</p>
			<p><em>Va</em> means highest of the knowledge. <em>Asa</em> means existing in everyone’s heart. Vasudeva means, the highest knowledge can be discovered only in one’s heart. This can be attained only through turning our attention inward.</p>
			<p>Everyone goes through three <em>avastas</em> (states) — <em>jagrat</em> (wakeful)<em>, swapna</em> (dream) <em>and supti</em> (deep sleep). No training is needed to go through these three <em>avastas</em> (states). But the fourth state called <em>Turiya</em> can be attained only through <em>sadhana</em> (intense practise). The <em>Om</em> represents these three <em>avastas—</em>-(states). Everyone goes through these three <em>avastas.</em> But with effort alone we can attain the fourth state called <em>Turiya.</em> The <em>jnanis</em> (knowers) experience this <em>Turiya avasta</em> (the fourth state) which leads to <em>moksha</em> (liberation) by the Grace of the indweller of all, the Lord in the form of Vasudeva. In Vasudeva Kriya you are inhaling with three syllable Om —A, U, and M and exhaling through twelve syllable Om Namo Bhagawate Vasudevaya.</p>
			<p>Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya means my salutations, prostrations, obeisance to the Lord who resides in our hearts to illumine both our inner and outer journey and who gives us the experience of the fourth state <em>Turiya</em>.</p>
			<p>Vasudeva Kriya can be practised at any place and time, and there is no time or place restriction to think of the Lord. Over months of practise, our breathing pattern changes, we start radiating peace. When we are at peace, our family members are at peace. When our family members are at peace, our community is at peace. When our community is at peace, our country is at peace. When the country is at peace, the world is at peace. The peace in the world must dawn in our hearts first.</p>
			<p>Vasudeva Kriya makes our life divine and makes us think of the Lord all the time. This is an attempt to experience the <em>Turiya</em> and think of the Lord in the last minute of our life. If we can think of the Lord in the last moment of the life and depart the body, there is no more rebirth and one gets liberated from the process of coming and going into one body or the other. Vasudeva Kriya Yoga is aimed at directly awakening the highest human potential. Vasudeva Kriya Yoga not only helps those who believe in the Supreme, but non believers will also derive some benefits. This is to be learnt under a teacher.</p>
