		<p class="text-center"><strong>Meditation Practise</strong></p>
		<p><i>Dhyana  </i>— meditation is the seventh step  in  <i>Patanjali</i>’s  <i>Ashtanga Yoga</i>. Meditation  should happen like blossoming of a flower.  We cannot force a flower to bloom. </p>
<p>The mind is like a child and it has to be  handled delicately. Having an obedient  mind is the key to meditation. There are  many meditation techniques. The main  requirements for meditation are devotion to  God and a steady posture, and slow breathing  (asana and <i>PranaPrana</i>yama). The main  purpose of doing various asanas is to be able  to sit in one position for a long time without  any discomfort. If the posture is unsteady,  the mind also becomes unsteady. If the  breathing becomes erratic, the mind gets  disturbed. Steady breathing is achieved by  the practise of various <i>PranaPrana</i>yamas.  The postures recommended for meditation  are  <i>Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha </i> <i>Padmasana </i>and <i>Vajrasana </i>(Pictures 159— 162a). For best results the practise should  be regular. Do your <i>sadhana  </i>(practise) in  the same place and at the same time. Sit  facing east or north for best results. Sit in  a room which is not frequented by visitors.  Put your mobile phones away. The place of  practise should be your private place and  not the place for chatting or gossiping. </p>
<p>Meditation is both like and unlike the  wakeful, dream and deep sleep states.  Meditation is like the wakeful state because  we are awakened to the inner world. It is  not like the wakeful state because we are  cut off from the outer world. Meditation is  like the dream state because we see inner  visions. Meditation is not like the dream  state because in a dream we do not have  the freedom of what we want to see, but in  meditation we see pictures carved out with  our mind. Meditation is like deep sleep  because we are not aware of the outer world.  Meditation is not like deep sleep, because  we are awakened to the inner world. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Japa</h2>
<p><i>Japa  </i>means repetition of a holy name  or  <i>mantra</i>.  <i>Japa  </i>is an important step in  meditation. Like asana is for the body,  <i>PranaPrana</i>yama is for the breath and  <i>japa  </i>is for the mind. <i>Japa  </i>gives focus to  the mind. <i>Japa </i>keeps the mind active and  healthy. Like iron picks up the quality of  magnet by constantly rubbing against it,  mind also acquires the noble and auspicious  qualities by doing <i>japa </i>for a length of time<i>. </i> Key to success is sincerity and regularity in  practise. </p>
<p>The number of times we repeat a <i>japa</i> can  be determined by the time that is available  to us. But care should be taken in not  over doing the <i>japa</i>, or else it will affect  our psyche. We have 72,000 <i>nadis</i> in the  body. If we are doing <i>dwadasha akshara </i> <i>mantra japa </i>(twelve syllable) (<i>Om Namo </i> <i>Bhagavate Vasudevaya</i>)<i> </i>we should not do  2,000 japa at a stretch or more than 6,000  in one day. 72,000/12 = 6,000). If we are  doing an <i>astakshari mantra japa (Om </i> <i>Namo Narayanaya</i>), we should not do  more than 9,000 <i>mantra japa </i>a day. If we  are doing 24 syllable <i>Gayatri mantra japa</i>,  we should not do more than 3,000 <i>mantra </i> <i>japa </i>a day. If we are doing a <i>panchakshari </i> <i>mantra japa (Nama Shivaya)</i>, we should  not do more than 14,400 <i>mantra japa</i> a  day. </p>
<p>There are 3 types of<i> japa</i> – <i>vaikari, </i> <i>upasnshu and manasik. </i></p>
<p><i>Vaikari japa </i>is done loudly mainly to  purify the surrounding. <i>Upanshu  </i>only the  person doing that hears and <i>manasik japa </i> is mental. <i>Manasik japa, when done over a </i> <i>period</i>, becomes <i>ajapa japa</i> — spontaneous  <i>japa. </i></p>
<p>A few meditation techniques are given.  Choose the type which suits you the best. </p>

<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Meditation 1: Mantra Japa</h2>
<p><i>Mana trayate iti mantraha. </i>‘Mantra is  that which helps us get past the clutches of  mind’. Mantra also purifies all the nadis.  <i>Acharya Madwa </i>explains the benefits of  chanting the <i>Vishnu Sahasranama </i>(1000  names of the Lord). Vishnu Sahasranama is  taken from <i>Brihati Sahasra </i>which is a part  of the <i>Rig Veda</i>. Each <i>Brihati Mantra </i>has  36 letters, and 1000 such <i>Brihat mantras </i> add up to 36,000 letters. Generally, each  letter is made of both masculine letter  (<i>swara</i>) and feminine letter (<i>vyanjana</i>).  So, chanting the <i>Vishnu Sahasranamahas </i> gives the effect of chanting 72,000 letters  which in turn cleanses our 36,000 <i>ida</i> nadis  and 36,000 <i>pingala </i>nadis. </p>
<p>In hundred years of life there are 36,000  days and 36,000 nights. Chanting the  Vishnu Sahasranama purifies all 72,000  nadis and makes that person live a full life  span of hundred years. </p>
<p>The  <i>Rigveda</i> has 432,000 letters and  in terms of <i>Brihati</i>, there are 12,000  <i>Brihati mantras</i>. Chanting the <i>Vishnu </i> <i>Sahasranama </i>12 times gives the benefit of  chanting the whole <i>Rigveda. </i></p>
<p><i>Process</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit in <i>Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha </i> <i>Padmasana </i>or<i> Vajrasana</i>. </p>
<li>If you cannot sit on the floor you can sit  on a chair. </p>
<li>Keep your body, head and neck in a  straight line. </p>
<li>Hold the chin up. </p>
<li>Bring thumbs and forefingers together  into <i>chin mudra </i>and place hands on the  knees with palms facing up. </p>
<li>Your body weight should be equally  distributed on your pin bones. </p>
<li>With inhalation feel the abdomen and  chest expanding. </p>
<li>With exhalation feel the chest and  abdomen contracting. </p>
<li>With inhalation you are drawing fresh  <i>Prana</i> into the body which energizes  the whole body. </p>
<li>With exhalation, you are releasing  toxins from the body. </p>
<li>When toxins are released from the  body, the mind becomes relaxed. </p>
<li>A relaxed mind expands and expanded  mind becomes creative. </p>
<li>Focus your attention on your chosen  ideal in your heart centre. </p>
<li>The <i>Antaryami </i>(the Supreme indweller,  Light of all Lights), is the Inner Essence  of all. The Supreme Lord is not limited  to one name or one form. </p>
<li>All the names and all the forms belong  to that <i>Antaryami  </i>(the Supreme  indweller). </p>
<li>Mentally repeat the Guru <i>mantra japa </i> (repetition of the Lord’s name) in the  same place, same time for the same  duration regularly. </p>
<li>The key to success is regularity and  sincerity. </p>
<li>The  <i>mantras  </i>are nothing but positive  affirmations. </p>
<li>We are what we think. </p>
<li>If we think positive always, we will not  only have a positive approach to life but  will also be able to motivate others to be  positive. </p>
<li>On the other hand, if we always  think negatively, we not only become  depressed and miserable but also make  others negative. </p>
<li>One starts radiating peace by doing the  <i>mantra japa </i>for a long time. </p>
<li>Mentally surrender to Him (the  indweller of all —<i>Antaryami</i>)<i>. </i></p>
<li>Enjoy the bliss within. </p>
<li>Sit in this position for as long as you can  without moving the body. </p>
<li>Finish off your meditation by chanting  ‘Om’ three times. </p>
<li>Rub your palms together and warm  your face muscles with the palms. </p>
<li>Gently open your eyes and relax.</p>

Another definition of ‘Om’ is ‘<i>Ooyate iti </i> <i>Om’ </i>meaning ‘That which is interwoven  with everything is ‘Om’’. </p>
<li>‘Om’ is all syllables in all languages. In  English ‘Om’ has become ‘Omni’and  ‘Amen’. In Islam ‘Om’ has become  ‘Amin.’ </p>

<li>When toxins are released from the  body, the mind becomes relaxed. </p>
<li>A relaxed mind expands and expanded  mind becomes creative. </p>
<li>Focus your attention on your chosen  ideal in your heart centre. </p>
<li>The <i>Antaryami </i>(the Supreme indweller,  Light of all Lights), is the Inner Essence  of all. The Supreme Lord is not limited  to one name or one form. </p>
<li>All the names and all the forms belong to  that <i>Antaryami </i>(the Supreme indweller). </p>
<li>Mentally repeat the Guru <i>mantra japa </i> (repetition of the Lord’s name) in the  same place, same time for the same  duration regularly. </p>
<li>The key to success is regularity and  sincerity. </p>
<li>The <i>mantras  </i>are nothing but positive  affirmations. </p>
<li>We are what we think. </p>
<li>If we think positive always, we will not  only have a positive approach to life but  will also be able to motivate others to be  positive. </p>
<li>On the other hand, if we always think  negatively, we not only become depressed  and miserable but also make others  negative. </p>
<li>One starts radiating peace by doing the  <i>mantra japa </i>for a long time. </p>
<li>Mentally surrender to Him (the  indweller of all — <i>Antaryami</i>)<i>. </i></p>
<li>Be aware of your slow inhalation and  exhalation. </p>

<li>This <i>anahata nada </i>(inner sound) is  nothing but the <i>Omkara  </i>sound from  within you.

<li>Wakeful, dream and deep sleep are  common to all and no special <i>sadhana </i> is needed to get this. </p>
<li>The fourth stage or <i>Turiya avasta </i>has to  be achieved through <i>sadhana  </i>(regular  practise) by all humans. </p>
<li> <i> </i> This <i>avasta </i>or stage is called as <i>Turiya </i> or <i>unmani bhava</i>. The Lord in the form  of <i>Vasudeva</i> gives us this fourth <i>avasta </i> or <i>Turiya</i> state. </p>

<li>When you inhale mentally chant three  syllable  <i>Om  </i>(A, U, M) and think of  different meanings of <i>Om.  </i>When you  exhale mentally say twelve syllable <i>Om </i> <i>Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya </i>and  think of its meaning. </p>
<li>You are inhaling through the count of  three and exhaling through the count of  twelve. </p>
<li>This type of breathing (<i>bhahya </i> <i>vritti Pranayama) </i>activates the  parasympathetic nervous system. </p>
<li>Over the months of practise, this  becomes ajapa japa (spontaneous). At  certain point even this type of breathing  stops and takes us to the fourth stage or </p>
<li> <i>  Turiya avasta. </i></p>
<li>This inturn makes our breathing slower  and makes us to release toxins quickly  from the body. </p>
