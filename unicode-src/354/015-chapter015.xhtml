		<p class="text-center"><strong>Meditation Practise</strong></p>
		<p><em>Dhyana</em> — meditation is the seventh step in <em>Patanjali</em>’s <em>Ashtanga Yoga</em>. Meditation should happen like blossoming of a flower. We cannot force a flower to bloom.</p>
		<p>The mind is like a child and it has to be handled delicately. Having an obedient mind is the key to meditation. There are many meditation techniques. The main requirements for meditation are devotion to God and a steady posture, and slow breathing (asana and <em>PranaPrana</em> yama). The main purpose of doing various asanas is to be able to sit in one position for a long time without any discomfort. If the posture is unsteady, the mind also becomes unsteady. If the breathing becomes erratic, the mind gets disturbed. Steady breathing is achieved by the practise of various <em>PranaPrana</em> yamas. The postures recommended for meditation are <em>Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha Padmasana</em> and <em>Vajrasana</em> (Pictures 159— 162a). For best results the practise should be regular. Do your <em>sadhana</em> (practise) in the same place and at the same time. Sit facing east or north for best results. Sit in a room which is not frequented by visitors. Put your mobile phones away. The place of practise should be your private place and not the place for chatting or gossiping.</p>
		<p>Meditation is both like and unlike the wakeful, dream and deep sleep states. Meditation is like the wakeful state because we are awakened to the inner world. It is not like the wakeful state because we are cut off from the outer world. Meditation is like the dream state because we see inner visions. Meditation is not like the dream state because in a dream we do not have the freedom of what we want to see, but in meditation we see pictures carved out with our mind. Meditation is like deep sleep because we are not aware of the outer world. Meditation is not like deep sleep, because we are awakened to the inner world.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Japa</h2>
			<p><em>Japa</em> means repetition of a holy name or <em>mantra</em>. <em>Japa</em> is an important step in meditation. Like asana is for the body, <em>PranaPrana</em>yama is for the breath and <em>japa</em> is for the mind. <em>Japa</em> gives focus to the mind. <em>Japa</em> keeps the mind active and healthy. Like iron picks up the quality of magnet by constantly rubbing against it, mind also acquires the noble and auspicious qualities by doing <em>japa</em> for a length of time.  Key to success is sincerity and regularity in practise.</p>
			<p>The number of times we repeat a <em>japa</em> can be determined by the time that is available to us. But care should be taken in not over doing the <em>japa</em>, or else it will affect our psyche. We have 72,000 <em>nadis</em> in the body. If we are doing <em>dwadasha akshara mantra japa</em> (twelve syllable) (<em>Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya</em>)  we should not do 2,000 japa at a stretch or more than 6,000 in one day. 72,000/12 = 6,000). If we are doing an <em>astakshari mantra japa (Om Namo Narayanaya</em>), we should not do more than 9,000 <em>mantra japa</em> a day. If we are doing 24 syllable <em>Gayatri mantra japa</em>, we should not do more than 3,000 <em>mantra japa</em> a day. If we are doing a <em>panchakshari mantra japa (Nama Shivaya)</em>, we should not do more than 14,400 <em>mantra japa</em> a day.</p>
			<p>There are 3 types of<em> japa</em> – <em>vaikari, upasnshu and manasik.</em></p>
			<p><em>Vaikari japa</em> is done loudly mainly to purify the surrounding. <em>Upanshu</em> only the person doing that hears and <em>manasik japa</em> is mental. <em>Manasik japa, when done over a period</em>, becomes <em>ajapa japa</em> — spontaneous <em>japa.</em></p>
			<p>A few meditation techniques are given. Choose the type which suits you the best.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Meditation 1: Mantra Japa</h2>
			<p><em>Mana trayate iti mantraha.</em> ‘Mantra is that which helps us get past the clutches of mind’. Mantra also purifies all the nadis. <em>Acharya Madwa</em> explains the benefits of chanting the <em>Vishnu Sahasranama</em> (1000 names of the Lord). Vishnu Sahasranama is taken from <em>Brihati Sahasra</em> which is a part of the <em>Rig Veda</em>. Each <em>Brihati Mantra</em> has 36 letters, and 1000 such <em>Brihat mantras</em> add up to 36,000 letters. Generally, each letter is made of both masculine letter (<em>swara</em>) and feminine letter (<em>vyanjana</em>). So, chanting the <em>Vishnu Sahasranamahas</em> gives the effect of chanting 72,000 letters which in turn cleanses our 36,000 <em>ida</em> nadis and 36,000 <em>pingala</em> nadis.</p>
			<p>In hundred years of life there are 36,000 days and 36,000 nights. Chanting the Vishnu Sahasranama purifies all 72,000 nadis and makes that person live a full life span of hundred years.</p>
			<p>The <em>Rigveda</em> has 432,000 letters and in terms of <em>Brihati</em>, there are 12,000 <em>Brihati mantras</em>. Chanting the <em>Vishnu Sahasranama</em> 12 times gives the benefit of chanting the whole <em>Rigveda.</em></p>

			<p><strong>&#9755; Introduction:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The word ‘Om’ has different meanings.</li> 
				<li>‘Om’ is a mono syllable and has 3 syllables: A, U and M</li> 
				<li>‘Om’ has 4 syllables A,U, M and Nada (sound).</li> 
				<li>‘Om’ has 8 Syllables — <em>A, U, M, Nada</em> (sound), <em>Bindu</em> (origin of audible sound), <em>Kala</em> (sound one sees in the heart before it is expressed), <em>Shanta</em> (small vibrations of the sound in the navel) and <em>Ati Shanta</em> (non—vibration in the naval before the vibration). Another definition of ‘Om’ is ‘<em>Ooyate iti Om’</em> meaning ‘That which is interwoven with everything is ‘Om’’.</li> 
				<li>‘Om’ is all syllables in all languages. In English ‘Om’ has become ‘Omni’and ‘Amen’. In Islam ‘Om’ has become ‘Amin.’</li> 
				<li><em>Process: Sit in Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha Padmasana</em> or<em> Vajrasana</em>.</li> 
				<li>If you cannot sit on the floor you can sit on a chair.</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Hold the chin up.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bring thumbs and forefingers together into <em>chin mudra</em> and place the hands on the knees with palms facing upwards.</li> 
				<li>Your body weight should be equally distributed on your pin bones.</li> 
				<li>With inhalation feel the abdomen and chest expanding.</li> 
				<li>With exhalation feel the chest and abdomen contracting.</li> 
				<li>With inhalation you are drawing fresh <em>Prana</em> into the body which energizes the whole body.</li> 
				<li>With exhalation, you are releasing toxins from the body.</li> 
				<li>When toxins are released from the body, the mind becomes relaxed.</li> 
				<li>A relaxed mind expands and expanded mind becomes creative.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>Focus your attention on your chosen ideal in your heart centre.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mentally chant ‘Om’ and meditate on the meaning below. ‘Om’ has 3 syllables A, U, M.</li> 
				<li>‘A’ means <em>avani</em> meaning earth, <em>bhu</em>. This means the Lord is all pervasive on the earth.</li> 
				<li>‘U’ means <em>Upari</em> meaning region above, <em>antariksha</em> or <em>bhuvaha</em>. This means the Lord not only pervades all over the earth but also extends beyond the earth in higher regions.</li> 
				<li>‘M’ means <em>manam jnanam</em> meaning the liberated region, <em>Vaikunta</em> (without defects), <em>Suvaha.</em></li> 
				<li>This means the Lord not only pervades all over the earth and intermediate regions, but also in the region above the heaven.</li> 
				<li>The Lord who pervades three worlds is in the tiny space in your heart centre.</li> 
				<li>This tiny space is smaller than the tip of the needle where our mind, our individual soul and all divine beings reside. The Narayana Upanishad says the same <em>tasyante sushiram soomksmam tasmin sarvam pratistitam</em> — Within the soul the Lord of the three worlds resides in my very own heart.</li> 
				<li>When we are aware of this, we will never be lonely or depressed.</li> 
				<li>Mentally surrender to Him and enjoy the bliss within</li> 
				<li>Sit in this position for as long as you can without moving the body.</li> 
				<li>Finish off your meditation by chanting ‘Om’ three times.</li>

				<li>A relaxed mind expands and expanded mind becomes creative.</li> 
				<li>Focus your attention on your chosen ideal in your heart centre.</li> 
				<li>The <em>Antaryami</em> (the Supreme indweller, Light of all Lights), is the Inner Essence of all. The Supreme Lord is not limited to one name or one form.</li> 
				<li>All the names and all the forms belong to that <em>Antaryami</em> (the Supreme indweller).</li> 
				<li>Mentally repeat the Guru <em>mantra japa</em> (repetition of the Lord’s name) in the same place, same time for the same duration regularly.</li> 
				<li>The key to success is regularity and sincerity.</li> 
				<li>The <em>mantras</em> are nothing but positive affirmations.</li> 
				<li>We are what we think.</li> 
				<li>If we think positive always, we will not only have a positive approach to life but will also be able to motivate others to be positive.</li> 
				<li>On the other hand, if we always think negatively, we not only become depressed and miserable but also make others negative.</li> 
				<li>One starts radiating peace by doing the <em>mantra japa</em> for a long time.</li> 
				<li>Mentally surrender to Him (the indweller of all — <em>Antaryami</em>). </li> 
				<li>Be aware of your slow inhalation and exhalation.</li> 
				<li>Hear the rhythmic <em>anahata nada</em> (inner sound – <em>nada</em> or <em>swara</em>) and enjoy the inner sound.</li> 
				<li>You may not hear the same rhythmic sound every time. It may keep changing but get immersed with that sound.</li> 
				<li>This <em>anahata nada</em> (inner sound) is nothing but the <em>Omkara</em> sound from within you. Some times you will hear this inner sound like kettle drum sound, our sound of a cart going in a gravel road, or like flute or like a <em>veena</em> sound (string instrument) or like <em>Omkara</em> sound.</li> 
				<li>The <em>Prana</em> inside is doing the <em>Pranava japa</em> for us. When we become aware of this <em>Pranava japa</em> inside we also get benefitted.</li>

				<li>Mentally surrender to the indweller the Lord <em>Vasudeva</em></li> 
				<li>Enjoy the bliss within.</li>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Meditation 10: Vasudeva Kriya Yoga</h2>
			<p><strong>&#9881; Process</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sit in <em>Siddasana, Padmasana, Ardha Padmasana</em> or<em> Vajrasana</em>.</li> 
				<li>If you cannot sit on the floor you can sit on a chair.</li> 
				<li>Keep your body, head and neck in a straight line.</li>

				<li>With inhalation you are drawing fresh <em>PranaPrana</em> into the body which energizes the whole body.</li> 
				<li>With exhalation, you are releasing toxins from the body.</li> 
				<li>When toxins are released from the body, the mind becomes relaxed.</li> 
				<li>A relaxed mind expands and expanded mind becomes creative.</li> 
				<li>Focus your attention on your chosen ideal in your heart centre.</li> 
				<li>Om is a mono syllable meaning <em>Ooyate iti om</em> – That which is interwoven with everything is Om’</li> 
				<li>Mentally chant ‘Om’ and meditate on the meaning below. ‘Om’ has 3 syllables A, U, M.</li> 
				<li>‘A’ means <em>aapti</em> meaning <em>vyapti</em> or wakeful state. The Lord in the form of Anirudda controls our wakeful state.</li> 
				<li><em> Rudda</em> means hindrances, <em>Anirudda</em> means without hindrances. <em>Anirudda</em> removes the obstacles in our wakeful sate.</li> 
				<li>‘U’ means <em>utkarsha,</em> meaning the dream state. The Lord in the form of <em>Pradyumna</em> controls our dream state.</li> 
				<li><em> Dyumna</em> means light, <em>Pradyumana</em> means ‘one who projects the special light in our root of the tongue to show us the dreams.’</li> 
				<li>‘M’ means <em>Manam</em> meaning merger or deep sleep.  This means ‘the Lord who controls our deep sleep.’ The Lord in the form of <em>Sankarshana</em> takes us to the deep sleep state.</li> 
				<li><em> Sankarshana</em> means attract. He attracts our soul to his lap and gives us bliss in our deep sleep and awakens us. That is why everyone is in bliss in deep sleep as we tap into our true nature unknowingly.</li> 
				<li>Wakeful, dream and deep sleep are common to all and no special <em>sadhana</em> is needed to get this.</li> 
				<li>The fourth stage or <em>Turiya avasta</em> has to be achieved through <em>sadhana</em> (regular practise) by all humans.</li> 
				<li>This <em>avasta</em> or stage is called as <em>Turiya</em> or <em>unmani bhava</em>. The Lord in the form of <em>Vasudeva</em> gives us this fourth <em>avasta</em> or <em>Turiya</em> state.</li> 
				<li>The Lord who gives us all the <em>avastas</em> or states is in the tiny space in your heart centre.</li> 
				<li>Mentally do the japa on <em>Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya</em> (my salutations to my indweller Lord <em>Vasudeva</em>).</li> 
				<li><em>Bhagawate</em> or <em>Bhagawan</em> means one who has <em>shat guna</em> (six qualities). The Lord alone has these six qualities and they are:
				<ol>
					<li><em>Iswarya:</em> Lordship over everything</li> 
					<li><em>Veerya:</em> Ability to subdue opponents. Finish off all undertakings without dropping off half way through</li> 
					<li><em>Yashas:</em> Glory everywhere</li> 
					<li><em>Shree:</em> Infinite wealth at disposal at all times</li> 
					<li><em>Jnana:</em> Infinite knowledge</li> 
					<li><em>Vairagya:</em> Non attachment to everything, no egoism on being owner of everything</li> 
				</ol>
				</li> 
				<li><em> Vasudeva</em> resides in our heart as the Lord to illumine the inner journey of those who have pure mind. When we are aware of this, we will never be lonely or depressed.</li> 
				<li>Mentally surrender to the Lord <em>Vasudeva</em>, the giver of the <em>Turiya avasta</em> which is very hard to get.</li> 
				<li>When you inhale mentally chant three syllable <em>Om</em> (A, U, M) and think of different meanings of <em>Om.</em> When you exhale mentally say twelve syllable <em>Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya</em> and think of its meaning.</li> 
				<li>You are inhaling through the count of three and exhaling through the count of twelve.</li> 
				<li>This type of breathing (<em>bhahya vritti Pranayama)</em> activates the parasympathetic nervous system.</li> 
				<li>Over the months of practise, this becomes ajapa japa (spontaneous). At certain point even this type of breathing stops and takes us to the fourth stage or</li> 
				<li><em>Turiya avasta.</em></li> 
				<li>This inturn makes our breathing slower and makes us to release toxins quickly from the body.</li> 
				<li>This type of breathing massages and relaxes the heart muscles.</li> 
				<li>This makes the mind relaxed quickly. The relaxed mind expands. In the expanded mind intuition dawns. In the expanded mind flashes and new revelations happens. Above all, even our mechanical breathing is sanctified.</li> 
				<li>Over the months of practise, our breathing pattern changes. We radiate peace and become like a walking temple spreading peace and harmony wherever we go.</li> 
				<li>This <em>Vasudeva Kriya</em> breathing helps us to contribute to the world peace and to enjoy the bliss within.</li> 
				<li>Sit in this position for as long as you can without moving the body.</li> 
				<li>Finish off your meditation by chanting ‘Om’ three times.</li> 
				<li>Rub your palms together and warm your face muscles with the palms.</li> 
				<li>Gently open your eyes and relax.</li>
