		<p><strong>“This is you. You have your eyes, hands and legs to use for yourself. We have given you the necessary education. The whole world is at your doorstep. Go and explore. Deal with it on your own.” </strong></p>
		<p>&ldquo;Listen. At this moment, I don&rsquo;t hear a psychologist reporting. This behaviour is unacceptable!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Late one night I received a call. A choking voice blurted out: &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am&hellip; ma&rsquo;am this client, he just wouldn&rsquo;t listen to anything I had to say&hellip;he was raving and ranting all through the session. He wanted instant remedies. And then&hellip;.he&hellip;I&hellip; I&rsquo;m so confused and hassled&hellip;what do I do? How do I deal with this?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I said, &ldquo;Listen. At this moment, I don&rsquo;t hear a psychologist reporting. This behaviour is unacceptable!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Silence.</p>
		<p>After a long pause, she said, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll call you back in some time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A young psychologist interning under me was on the phone. She called the next morning and briefed me about the background and the current context of the case, her diagnosis, and highlighted the pressing concerns she was facing.</p>
		<p>What a transformation, I thought!</p>
		<p>She was not reacting like last night, but was responding to the situation. She was methodical and mature. No longer overwhelmed by emotion she had applied her mind. Her approach was solution-oriented. She did not ask for solutions but sought them by digging deep into the resources within her: knowledge and experience, and, the facts of the case.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now you sound balanced and professional.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She said, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, your words made a difference. After speaking to you, I sat myself down, relaxed and invoked my knowledge and experience with confidence. I looked at the case from multiple angles. I studied the case and recalled the interaction I had had with the client during the counseling session. I realized the issue had gripped me so much that I failed to distinguish between objective data and my personal feelings and prejudices. As I read the case and the diagnosis, again and again, I gained clarity. I saw the situation in a different light altogether. You challenged me to step out of my comfort zone. I had grown excessively dependent on you. I expected you to dish out answers, not realising that my growth would be stunted. Now I understand that I can deal with my clients effectively if I use my resources efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>My intern&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;you challenged me&rdquo;, took me down memory lane to a night at the end of my summer holidays when I sat packing my school bag in preparation for the first day of 9th grade. My mother came into my room, handed me an alarm clock and wristwatch. She nonchalantly said, &ldquo;Here, this is for you. You must perform well. Do the needful.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This was her way of preparing me for the board exams. Her message was clear. I would have to wake myself up in the mornings to study. This was my first lesson in time-management, self-reliance and owning responsibility.</p>
		<p>A similar dialogue from my mother came to me during a phase of transition. Armed with an M. Phil Degree, I was on the threshold of embarking on a career.</p>
		<p>The excitement of earning the degree had waned and the anxiety of an uncertain future loomed large. I asked my mother, &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This is you. You have your eyes, hands and legs to use for yourself. We have given you the necessary education. The whole world is at your doorstep. Go, explore and deal with it on your own.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then she walked away. At the time, I felt she was harsh. Once I recovered from the initial shock, I began to ponder over her words. It dawned on me that they were meant to challenge me to look for answers within myself. Soon after, in addition to taking up the position of a clinical psychologist at a school for differently-abled children, I started a private practice.</p>
		<p>In both instances, my mother had dared me to push my boundaries. The impact was two-pronged: one, to discover my inner strength and harness my knowledge and experience to make independent decisions, and, second, to take responsibility for my life. Thereafter, I still discussed issues with my mother. But, I was no longer seeking answers from her. Instead, I sought her perspective while making my own decisions. Opportunities are boundless for the one who seeks! There are no limits.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Challenge and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>The technique of Challenging has a dual purpose: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>To enhance performance</li>
				<li>To initiate change in perspective</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We live in a world defined by rapid changes in every sphere of life. The pace of change is so swift that the pressure to measure up and excel has manifold implications on our performance and health. The need to constantly update, relearn and unlearn can hardly be emphasised. As Alvin Toffler has said, &ldquo;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&rdquo; While the younger generation is fueled by ambition and focused on achievement, it also finds itself amidst a work culture that thrives on stiff competition and demands increasing levels of excellence.</p>
			<p>The one who challenges (mentor) may be a boss, a coach, a parent, a friend or a sibling. There is an inherent understanding between this mentor and the one being challenged (mentee). This means that in a given situation, the mentor is in a position of authority or trust <em>vis-a-vis</em> the mentee. For instance, a boss or a coach is in a position of command, and a friend is in a position of being trustworthy. A simple example of this is an older sibling telling a younger sibling, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you practice. How will you learn if you don&rsquo;t practice?&rdquo; or a friend who says, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even tried. How will you know if you&rsquo;ll succeed?&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Over the years, there has been a surge in students, professionals and sportspeople seeking ways to continually push themselves to perform better by learning smarter techniques. As professional counselors, we can provide them with alternative viewpoints that will work to enhance their current performance. These perspectives will enable them to adhere to a lifelong process of challenging themselves and knowing when to draw a line.</p>
			<p>While thinking about the professional context, I recollect an experience shared by a participant during a Life Coaching session.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For the first time in my 2-year career, I feel extremely incompetent. I have been working on this project for 6 months now. Despite my best efforts, I failed on my deliverables. I got an earful from my manager. Soon enough, I got a call from the HR manager. My first thought was - Alright. I am fired. I confessed to the HR manager that despite working overtime and on weekends, I had failed to reach the target. The manager only said - Have you tried to crack the &lsquo;code&rsquo; of the challenge?</p>
			<p>The HR manager&rsquo;s words proved to be a turnaround. That one question got me thinking. She had pushed me to work smarter, not harder. I spent time equipping myself with more knowledge about the subject. I did research.&nbsp;I understood the crux of the matter. I realised I had been working mechanically and did not have conceptual clarity. My speed improved by 50% the very next day and by the end of the week, I was able to reach my targets.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Certain preconditions are necessary for the technique of Challenging to yield the desired results. That brings us to the question: What is the ecosystem that must be present for the technique of Challenging to be exercised and for it to yield the expected results?</p>
			<p>The most important element of this ecosystem is the presence of a certain understanding between the one challenging and the one being challenged.</p>
			<p>This understanding is a two-way process: the counseled or mentee must be able to identify certain character traits in the counselor or mentor. Similarly, the counselor or mentor should be able to recognise certain characteristics in the counseled or mentee.</p>
			<p>Let us first look at this from the perspective of the mentee.</p>
			<p>Go back to the case of my intern. She was a young professional taking initial steps in her career and had worked with me for six months on a project. Upon completion, she approached me for an internship. She had vested in me the responsibility to train and guide her. I was in a position of authority. This authority came from my subject matter expertise and my position of being a qualified and experienced therapist. A manager, coach or trainer is an expert in a specific subject, which gives them a position of authority that makes them qualified to Challenge.</p>
			<p>However, authority alone is not sufficient. My intern had assessed and determined my credibility. She had developed faith and trust in me based on her experience of working with me for six months. She assessed my knowledge, professional experience and personal traits. Therefore she was confident that I would assist her in her evolution into a mature professional. Such credibility can also be established through recommendation. Nevertheless, over the first couple of sessions or interactions, the counselee or mentee must be able to develop faith in a counselor&rsquo;s or mentor&rsquo;s skills and intentions.</p>

			<p>Let us now look at it from the perspective of the counselor or mentor.</p>
			<p>As a mentor, you have to be perceptive to certain qualities in your counselee or mentee before you can Challenge them.</p>
			<figure id="chap1-fig2">
				<img src="images/003.jpg" alt="image" />
				<figcaption><em>Figure 2: Some qualities in the mentee that a mentor identifies before Challenging.</em></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><strong>Clearly Articulated Intent</strong> &ndash; In professional counseling, if the client is seeking to enhance performance, then the &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; is explicit and initiated by the client. The counselee or mentee must explicitly or implicitly express their acceptance of your role as a counselor or mentor. In the case of my intern, she had clearly articulated her need to enhance her performance. She specifically said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to intern under you, ma&rsquo;am. I think you can help me evolve into a mature counselor and guide me in my career.&rdquo;</p>
			<p><strong>Motivation &ndash;</strong> The counselee or mentee may be motivated to learn and improve. If the mentee is coerced into seeking help, then you must first motivate them and only then Challenge them.</p>
			<p><strong>Action Oriented </strong>- The counselee or mentee must be open to being challenged. Intent alone is not enough. Intent must be translated into action, which involves taking measurable steps to achieve goals. Many sports enthusiasts are willing to be challenged so that they can participate in tougher competitions. Challenging oneself is the primary purpose of self-actualisation.</p>
			<p><strong>Readiness</strong> - The counselee or mentee must be at a stage in their life or career, where they are mature enough and ready to take on a challenge. My intern was on the brink of taking off into a solo career.</p>
			<p><strong>Lack/Need</strong>: The counselee or mentee must consistently show the need for improvement. While my intern regularly sought my inputs, she had also become complacent and dependent on me. Although the desire to get a strong foothold in her profession was apparent, she had reached a plateau. This was an indication that she was ready to move to the next level. I was waiting for an opportunity to challenge her.</p>
			<p>We do not always need an external agent or person to challenge us. As we grow and gain maturity, we learn to challenge and push ourselves. Highly motivated people continuously challenge themselves. It is an effective technique to ensure growth and progress, achieve personal and relationship goals, enhance performance and realign perspectives. A few challenging words are often a rude awakening from complacency!</p>
