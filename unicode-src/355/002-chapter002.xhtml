		<p class="text-center"><strong>‘Your silence is a concern for me.’</strong></p>
		<p>A couple married for over two decades, with a 17-year-old child, entered my consulting room one evening. The wife wanted a separation. She resented her husband&rsquo;s obsessive nature. She declared she <em>never</em> loved her husband. The husband was in a state of shock for he had always believed that he was blessed with a loving wife and an ideal marriage.</p>
		<p>He confided in me saying, &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand. For twenty years, we have coped quite well with the vicissitudes of life. I had no reasons to believe that she didn&rsquo;t love me. Yes, she never asked for or initiated physical intimacy. She wouldn&rsquo;t hold my hand when we were outside. I thought that is her nature; she is always remote and to herself. I had accepted her that way&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>Here was a couple seeking marital counseling for challenges they were facing at an advanced stage of their married life. While handling relationship issues, especially marital, I always set the tone by stating clearly that the primary client is their marriage; and that the sessions will be focused on resolving the conflict in the relationship rather than to support or undermine either of the spouses. I also clearly defined my role in the therapeutic relationship, &ldquo;Neither of you is wrong. Neither of you is right. I am not going to deliver a verdict in favour of one or the other. I will only try to give my understanding of what has transpired and suggest how we can resolve the issues.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>My prerogative is to treat each of them as persons in their own right and be a patient listener giving equal time and importance to each of them.</p>
		<p>As the rapport built, the husband said during a session, &ldquo;I have no inhibitions sharing my issues with you. Issues which I don&rsquo;t even feel comfortable sharing with my close friends. I feel that you can understand my wife and me. You relate to our experiences well; I am confident that you can help us resolve our differences. You are gender neutral in your approach!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His feedback played in my mind that night. His words took me back in time to an event that occurred in the early phase of my career. Expression of empathy from a facilitator at a Personal Growth Lab had lent a new dimension to my experiential landscape. It was indeed a turning point, for it imbibed the quality of empathy within me as a human being and practising psychologist.</p>
		<p>One of the sessions focused on gender parity and gender-based biases, and its ramifications on the female psyche and society in general. The discussion was intense and the atmosphere was emotionally charged. Just before noon break, a male participant shared an incident about a friend who initiated his daughter-in-law&rsquo;s remarriage within a few days of his son&rsquo;s demise. The participant was surprised that the daughter-in-law had failed to appreciate her father-in-law&rsquo;s nobility and progressive thinking.</p>
		<p>I found myself growing quiet. I was present, aware and involved but quiet. I remained so for that entire session. I experienced a deep disquiet. Anger, disgust, cynicism played havoc in my mind as I seethed beneath a quiet demeanor. After some time, the facilitator said, &ldquo;<strong>You have been quiet for a while now. Your silence is a concern for me.&rdquo;</strong></p>
		<p>At that moment, I broke my silence. I expressed myself without inhibitions for the first time - about the patriarchal nature of our society that defines what a woman should do with herself, her emotions and experiences, including her grief, and how she should deal with and express sorrow. Should she even grieve?! The deep-rooted anger and anguish I held for societal norms defined largely by men emerged into my consciousness. At the end, I found myself relieved of a huge burden. I felt free, free to dance and free to be.</p>
		<p>The facilitator&rsquo;s words had struck a chord in my heart. &ldquo;Your silence is a concern for me&rdquo; - I found myself a recipient of EMPATHY. The timing, the choice of words, the thought and feeling behind those words were so potent that it became a transformational experience.</p>
		<p>Why was this seemingly quotidian incident so powerful? Why do I call it transformational?</p>
		<p>The facilitator had observed me and was concerned. That by itself was cathartic. I felt that he stood by me in the painful experience of being denied the space to express my emotions and ideas as a woman in a patriarchal society.</p>
		<p>The facilitator was sensitive enough to recognise that my silence was also a form of response. His recognition of my silence was an acknowledgement of &lsquo;me&rsquo;. Awareness and Acceptance is the first step toward change and healing. He related to me as a human being without the prejudices attached to my gender, all while we were discussing the highly sensitive issue of gender-based disequilibrium. This was an externalisation of his objective approach. At the same time, his genuine concern and his ability to identify with my experience, not as a &lsquo;man&rsquo;, but as a &lsquo;human&rsquo;, was an expression of his subtle subjective involvement. He beautifully managed to strike the precarious balance between objective distance and subjective involvement.</p>
		<p>Finally, his expression was also feedback - he was telling me what he thought of my behaviour without being judgmental. It was a far cry from the general norm of building relationships on a foundation of preconceived notions and judgment.</p>
		<p>Those words of empathy kindled a spark in me that grew to become a purging fire. It was a deep subconscious learning experience of being genuinely understood and empathised with. I was valued for my &lsquo;self&rsquo;, my opinions and thoughts were appreciated for their intrinsic worth and were not measured or judged against the yardstick of sociocultural norms.</p>
		<p>As students of human behaviour and as practicing clinical psychologists, we are told time and again that empathy is a vital skill in counseling. We read plenty of theories in books and equip ourselves with tools and techniques to express empathy. Yet, many of us would not have experienced empathy in our personal lives. Hence, our expression of empathy could only be mechanical and not experiential.</p>
		<p>Receiving empathy empowered me towards an involved expression of empathy towards another. I began to relate to my clients on an individual level - as an individual who relates to the pain of another individual and who is driven to assist in alleviating pain.</p>
		<p>This awareness changed the way I connected with my clients, especially those experiencing marital disharmony. I could relate and empathise with the husband as an individual in disharmony and not as a woman psychologist talking to the male counterpart of a female client.</p>
		<p>As a follow-up to the workshop, the facilitator and I worked on a few marital disharmony cases. I noticed the difference in my approach and treatment. I also observed that clients were more reciprocal and open to change with my renewed position of being EMPATHETIC.</p>
		<p>For those of us working towards empowering another human to deal with crisis situations, the greatest challenge is striking a balance between being objective about the experiences of our client and simultaneously being sensitive to their emotional needs, irrespective of the variable contexts involved.</p>
		<p>In counseling, the emotional resources that you acquire during your interactions with the world are as significant as the intellectual resources gained through academic study.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Empathy and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>Expression of empathy is an important technique in psychological counseling and is a priceless experiential learning experience.</p>
			<p>It plays a vital role in establishing rapport between the counselor and the counseled. Appropriate and timely expression enhances harmony in relationships by mitigating conflicts and arguments. It opens new avenues and facilitates a panoramic view of the situation. Thus, it helps formulate a clear plan of action. As a practicing psychologist, you commit to a mental contract to voluntarily participate in their journey of pain and facilitate the alleviation of this pain.</p>
			<p>Empathy connects people at a profoundly emotional and experiential level. Empathy is expressed as a response to pain since it is natural for human beings to seek help during crisis. It is also expressed during moments of joy. Only, the mode of expression differs. It is usually an overt display of affection such as hugging or holding hands or a firm handshake with a smile to say: I am with you in this happiness. I am as happy as you are. The point of difference is that there is no follow-up action involved.</p>
			<p>During my career as a counselor, I have identified a few parameters involved in the expression of empathy. I exercise these parameters to give the recipient a holistic experience of empathy.</p>

			<p>All of us possess the capacity to express empathy. As a therapist, it is essential to utilise your resources and show empathy to your clients in the most efficient manner to enable resolution and recovery.</p>
			<p>The table below distinguishes between empathetic and non-empathetic responses through examples.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Parameter</th>
					<th>Client Statement</th>
					<th>Empathetic Response</th>
					<th>Non-Empathetic Response</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy is action-oriented.</td>
					<td>Being around her is frustrating. She fights all the time. </td>
					<td>I understand. It must be difficult for you.</td>
					<td>Stay away from her. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy focuses on listening</td>
					<td>I am in a fix. I love her. I want to be around her, but I cannot live with her. She irritates me and fights all the time.</td>
					<td>I understand your confusion: you want to be with her but find it frustrating and painful to be with her.</td>
					<td>Why don’t you just decide, this way or that? End the confusion and distress.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Self-reflection as a tool for the client.</td>
					<td>She becomes angry whenever my mother visits us. What can I do? My mother is a nice person. You can ask all my friends and their wives too.</td>
					<td>Would you like to understand the dynamics between your mother and your wife?</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Self-reflection for self - counsellor/trainer.</td>
					<td>She becomes angry whenever my mother visits us. What can I do? My mother is a nice person. You can ask all my friends and their wives too.</td>
					<td>What is it about these statements that triggers so much anger/angst in me? Let me look at it in my session with my supervisor or reflect on it later.</td>
					<td>Why bother! Let me just complete the session and help the man find a solution.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Empathy uses powerful yet simple words to express the other’s feelings.</td>
					<td>You know, despite her behaviour towards my mother, I helped her mother when she was not well. I took leave from office and did the needful even though she is against my mother. For me, a mother is a mother.</td>
					<td>I appreciate your ability to put aside your anger to help her mother.<br /> I understand your view about love towards mothers.</td>
					<td>Great! You did it because that is YOU.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>The aim is not to be caught in the web of power dynamics.</td>
					<td>Whom do you support? My wife or me?</td>
					<td>In marital counselling, the ‘relationship’ is my primary client and not either of you. I will work on enhancing the quality of the ‘relationship’ because neither of you is right nor wrong. Your interaction is not harmonious, probably because of your expectations and past experiences. I will try to help you understand that and then make choices.<br /> I am with you on this journey of struggle.</td>
					<td>I am on nobody’s side. I will try to help both of you.</td>
