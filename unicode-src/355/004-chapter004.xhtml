		<p class="text-center"><strong>‘If it can be named, it can be nailed.’</strong></p>
		<p>A client in a verbally abusive marital relationship, after enduring a particularly intense bout of anger from her spouse, sought counseling to gain clarity about the future of her marriage. Unable to deal with the emotional trauma, she was contemplating divorce. She said that although her husband was a good man, he had extreme anger issues, and verbal abuse was a routine affair.</p>
		<p>She said that she was living through a perpetual nightmare. His anger was directed against her very &lsquo;being&rsquo; because she was targeted for everything from morning to evening. She was criticised for how she dressed, what she cooked, how she kept her house. Everything was deemed as flawed and resulted in a verbal spat. She dreaded the weekends and the long drives, which were supposed to be romantic outings, but in the confines of the car, all she endured were verbal abuse sessions.</p>
		<p>During our discussions, I gathered that from childhood she was conditioned to correlate the purpose of a woman&rsquo;s life with finding happiness and meaning in marriage. Her experiential reality, however, was different. Although married, she was unhappy. Terminating her marriage was an option. But, because of her conditioning, she had believed that she would still remain unhappy. At this juncture, she had insight into her condition. She said, &ldquo;Marriage and happiness need not go hand in hand. One can be married and unhappy, or unmarried and still be happy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The instant she said this she realised that &lsquo;happiness&rsquo; is not related to or dependent on any one person or any one situation. She had to break the correlation between happiness and marriage. With this new- found clarity, she invested her efforts to find happiness in experiences that were not related to her spouse. She found joy in simple things of life that she could do alone, without expecting her husband to be a part of it and by exercising detachment to her spouse&rsquo;s behaviour. In a few months, her spouse&rsquo;s abusive behaviour began to recede, although she hadn&rsquo;t changed in any way to suit his tastes.</p>
		<p>One day, she mustered enough courage to ask him about his changed behaviour. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt that you are a powerful woman. I thought that if I didn&rsquo;t control you from the beginning, you would end up dominating me. However, over the past few days, you seem to be in a world of your own. My existence doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to you. My words and behaviour no longer disturb your peace. I may have overpowered you, but I have lost you as my partner in this journey of life.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Her reply was: &ldquo;That was your choice. Now, I have made my choice. I am happy this way. You need to figure out your happiness with or without me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She had found a new path on which to tread, alone.</p>
		<p>Clarity can fortify one&rsquo;s beliefs, especially when exposed to multiple conflicting viewpoints. During a workshop on Nature Vs. Nurture in relation to child development I was trying to establish that both nature and nurture play a vital role. Underestimating the impact of either can impede a holistic understanding of childhood development.</p>
		<p>After the session, a couple from the group asked for an appointment for a personal counseling session. They said they were members of a self-help group for couples who have adopted children or are contemplating adoption.</p>
		<p>The couple described their intense desire to share their lives with a child. The lady said that she wanted the experience of giving love and receiving love from a child; and, of nurturing the child physically and emotionally and in turn becoming richer by experience.</p>
		<p>However, they faced an onslaught of opinions from family and friends who raised questions about the caste and religion of the child, and about how the parent-child dynamics by way of adoption wouldn&rsquo;t be the same as biological parenthood and so on.</p>
		<p>I made a simple observation, <strong>&ldquo;Psychologically, you are already parents, even if not biologically.&rdquo; </strong>Their need was rooted in a mutually nourishing, symbiotic relationship with the child. Their desire for parenthood was intrinsic and transcended the biological constraints of genes and social constructs of caste and religion.</p>
		<p>The couple went ahead and adopted a child. The proud parents visited me with the child. The father said, &ldquo;You affirmed our belief in the idea of adoption. Thank you.&rdquo; My statement, which in fact was a mere observation, reaffirmed their belief that the psychological contract and commitment to their child, ran deeper than a mere biological relationship.</p>
		<p>In some instances, clarity has to be sought at the deep subconscious level of human experience. Thoughts, beliefs, desires and experiences, especially painful ones, are suppressed and embedded in our subconscious mind. We may not even be aware that these experiences are operating subliminally and guiding our thought processes and behaviours. An insight into these undercurrents often enhances clarity.</p>
		<p>A client suffered from severe, recurrent headaches. She had already visited several doctors and specialists but in vain. No diagnosis had been made thus far. No underlying physiological cause for her headaches had been found.</p>
		<p>Pain is often associated with a malady at the physiological level, and cure is sought only in remedying the physical body. The general tendency is to associate pain with the physical body and to find a diagnosis in medical terms. Medical diagnosis is not always the best approach to pain. Digging into the experiences of the client throws up psychological pain points that manifest as physical pain. These experiences may be of the present or buried in childhood and growing up years.</p>
		<p>I gathered the details of my client&rsquo;s life, right from her earliest memories. A thorough probing revealed that as a child, she had experienced a deficit of attention from her immediate caregivers. This childhood void manifested as headaches that were, in fact, an expression of her need for attention from family members.</p>
		<p>Once I was convinced of this hypothesis, I shared the same with her, paraphrasing her experience in a non-confronting and non-judgmental manner. I suggested that recovery from the headache was a two-step process: first, to come to terms with early childhood deprivation of attention and go beyond it, and second, to find healthy ways to gain attention from her present family members. The insatiable need for attention led to stress and helplessness, which led to recurring headaches.</p>
		<p>The impact of my feedback was instantaneous. She heaved a long sigh of relief. She said, &ldquo;Wait. Give me a few minutes. I am feeling extremely relieved and relaxed. If it can be named, it can be nailed. And I think I have nailed it. Or rather, you have helped me nail it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>We worked together to find ways to let go of the sense of deprivation and adopt healthy ways of fulfilling her need for attention.</p>
		<p>Not always are the sources of muddled thinking rooted in the past. Sometimes, they are in the here and now. This reminds me of my own experience during facilitation at the Group Relations Conference in Leicester, U.K. The conference offers an experiential, hands-on learning about group, organisational and social dynamics. One of the activities was aimed at extrapolating hypotheses from the collective unconscious of a group of participants. A facilitator observes the dynamics of group-interaction for 90 minutes and then makes a specific hypothesis. After each session, all facilitators make a quick presentation of their observations and hypothesis to the conference director in a review meeting.</p>
		<p>During one such activity, in my enthusiasm and compulsion to &lsquo;perform&rsquo;, I began to provide hypotheses every half an hour. I had correlated quantity with efficiency. My co-moderator and I launched ourselves into a sort of competition. The Conference Director having observed me, during the Review Meeting, in the presence of all the other facilitators, said, &ldquo;Are you a hypothesis-generating machine?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His words hit me like a thunderbolt. I was jolted out of my complacency. He had given me a sharp reality bite. I became acutely aware of a deficit, and it trampled my confidence. It shook the foundation of my self-image. He made me aware of my self-imposed style of churning out hypothesis after hypothesis, as a measure of performance. I had been unmindful of the here and now. I had not really listened to the participants - I was only hearing them out. I had missed the subtle workings of the unconscious mind, whose identification was the primary objective. I didn&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to read between the lines, to probe what lay behind the words. I had not connected with the &lsquo;unconscious mind&rsquo; of the group, which reveals itself to the discerning observer.</p>
		<p>I ran to the restroom. My face was flushed in embarrassment. My palms were sweaty. But I braced myself. I said to myself, &ldquo;Set your ego aside. Be flexible and grow.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Exercising mindful silence was the first step to immerse myself in the moment and space of the session. I became a calm observer. The undercurrents began to emerge clearly, beyond the din of the obviously visible interactions. I provided a hypothesis only when I observed significant patterns. I noticed that the group had begun to engage in a more profound manner. The unconscious undercurrents unfolded. It was an experience that shaped my future engagement with participants or clients, in all the training and counseling sessions. I could now strike a balance between silence and speech, by being in the here and now.</p>
		<p>Well, sometimes, clients are not really aware of what they want and if what they want is in alignment with their innate strengths and capacities, and the reality of external circumstances. I have come across many clients who are in such a dilemma concerning their professional life. Many of these choices are life altering and impact in terms of financial security, job satisfaction, passion and so on. In making these choices and gaining clarity, there is no question of right and wrong. The only question is about making a well-informed choice through clarity of mind that resonates with their inner potential.</p>
		<p>The idea of entrepreneurship and start-ups has caught the fancy of the younger generation. While it is a positive trend, an objective analysis is essential before making the jump from a salaried job to entrepreneurship. Lack of clarity in terms of professional goals often leads to a crisis.</p>
		<p>A young professional, frustrated with his 9-5 job and brimming with ideas for a start-up, sought help to sort things out in his mind. He shot a volley of questions: &ldquo;Should I quit? Will I get a steady income? Would I have to compromise my lifestyle? What if I fail?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I asked him to spend a few minutes to think of what his own answers would be to the questions.</p>
		<p>Then I asked him, &ldquo;Do you want to be the pillar of an organisation or a brick in the organisation?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He seemed dazed for a moment. He recovered and tried to understand what it meant to be a &lsquo;pillar&rsquo; and what it meant to be a &lsquo;brick&rsquo;. Through this analogy, he deciphered the roles and responsibilities associated with being a &lsquo;pillar&rsquo; and a &lsquo;brick&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s when he began to gain clarity. He said that he hadn&rsquo;t realised that building a business was as good as building a monument or a house and maintaining it under extremely volatile conditions. He realised that he was looking at entrepreneurship as a way out of the frustration of his current job. He now knew that it was a life choice that brings with it a set of challenges as well as responsibilities.</p>
		<p>After a lengthy discussion, he said that he preferred to be a brick and have the pillar support him rather than be the pillar himself. &ldquo;I will deal with the frustration of my current job better. I will work out a middle path and figure out how the pillar can support me and how I can support the pillar.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A few weeks later, he called to say that he had negotiated for a more fulfilling role and had assumed responsibilities that would be mutually beneficial. He had also found a way to establish a better rapport with his manager and to strike a work-life balance.</p>
		<p>The same dialogue with another employee had a different outcome. He was a highly creative person with a passion for music. He dreamed of making music his profession. Stuck in a monotonous, mechanical but well-paying job, he experienced this compelling urge to break free and turn to music. His primary concerns were financial instability and his family&rsquo;s reaction to his decision.</p>
		<p>I asked him the same question: Do you want to be a brick or a pillar of an organisation? If you can find an answer to this fundamental question, you will have found answers to all other questions.</p>
		<p>He chose to become a pillar in whatever small way possible. He had laid the foundation to start a band of his own. To tide over financial difficulties, he would work as a part-time consultant. Thus, he had found a way to balance his profession and passion.</p>
		<p>Thus, the cognitive process of gaining clarity has transformative power. When all else seems bleak, the beacon of clarity reveals the way forward.</p>

			<h2 class="level2-title" epub:type="title">Clarity and Change Dynamics</h2>
			<p>Clarity of thought has a direct impact on decision-making. In playing numerous roles, we always make decisions, sometimes with ease, and at others, we are in a fix. Some such decisions can have far-reaching consequences on our lives. Decision-making can be a complicated and stressful process. Clarity is one of the fundamental elements that assists and eases decision-making.</p>
			<p>Although clarity is most often gained in an epiphanic moment, it is a result of a period of churning and chaos. It is a process of movement from a state of fluidity, uncertainty to a state of &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; and &lsquo;discovery&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>Clients sometimes may only need a reaffirmation of their decisions. The role of the counselor then is not to suggest whether the client&rsquo;s need/desire is right or wrong, but to understand and make them aware of their own implicit aspirations. The dialogue - &ldquo;Psychologically, you are already parents, even if not biologically&rdquo;- reaffirmed the couple&rsquo;s belief in themselves that they had the capacity and strength to bring up a child with loving care, i.e., the psychological readiness over the biological process of giving birth.</p>
			<p>Clarity sometimes requires subverting cultural and social beliefs and norms. The spouse in the abusive marital relationship was conditioned since childhood to believe that for a woman, marriage is the only source of happiness. This gender stereotype of associating marriage as the one and only source of happiness for a woman had to be broken. The client had to realise that happiness can be found in experiences other than that of a compatible relationship with her spouse. The spouse, or for that matter any one individual, need not necessarily be part of every happy experience. Thus, she began her journey to find happiness on her own terms.</p>
			<p>This brings us to the fact that clarity is gained only in a context. It cannot emerge out of a vacuum. The setting of interpretation is critical as illustrated in the pillar-brick dialogue. Although the dialogue was the same, the situations of the two clients were different, and the decisions made by them after they gained clarity were also different.</p>
			<p>The impact that a sudden sense of clarity has on an individual must also be examined here. An immediate sense of clarity, which is also a deep introspective insight, can lead to great relief and liberation, or to uncertainty and insecurity. The client, who realised that her chronic migraines were a result of an unresolved childhood experience, sighs in relief and feels unburdened with the clarity she has gained. Whereas, I was gripped with fear because the director had thrown light on an area of my personality that wasn&rsquo;t positive and that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with. Besides, the director&rsquo;s feedback was rather blunt. Not all of us can handle such direct, candid feedback.</p>
			<p>Clarity can be engendered in a person only if the person is open for self-reflection. Having an open mind requires the person to undo certain preconceived notions, prejudices and biases. We have to rise above our conditioning and take a fresh look at things. Openness is also the ability to view one&rsquo;s own context from a holistic perspective, and this requires knowledge. For instance, the client who was keen on venturing into entrepreneurship lacked knowledge about two things: his own strengths and weaknesses, and the various dimensions involved in establishing and running a start-up. He was fuelled by impulsive passion and had a simplistic understanding of running a business.</p>
			<p>A vital prerequisite that prods one to introspect and seek clarity is trust. The director of the conference was a person I trusted because of his position and credibility. Although initially shocked and confused, I convinced myself that I should take cognizance of his words and trust his judgment. The couple who sought clarity on adoption had established trust after listening to me during the Nature Vs. Nurture workshop. In the brick and pillar dialogue, both clients found validation in my analysis of what it meant for a person to be a brick and a pillar of an organisation and my assessment of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

			<p><strong>The Process of Gaining Clarity</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Trust Client’s Capacity to gain Clarity</li>
				<li>Understand the Context –The context of interpretation is critical. Clarity cannot be achieved in a vacuum. It is always in relation to ‘meaning of the word’ (as I experienced in the hypothesis-generating dialogue) not just at the base level. But the deeper connotations are to be explored while seeking clarity for self and others.</li>
				<li>Collate data by asking leading interrogative questions. Gather implicit/explicit needs, desires and aspirations.</li>
				<li>Help the client gain insight into and break biases, prejudices and preconceived notions. Make the client aware of the relevance or irrelevance of the assumptions held. The context may reveal a set of assumptions that can hinder the process of gaining clarity. </li>
				<li>Address fears and anxieties.</li>
				<li>Offer alternate viewpoints.</li>
				<li>Give time and space to assimilate.</li>
				<li>Identify and evaluate implications and consequences.</li>
				<li>Help make a decision in good faith.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Gaining clarity is, therefore, a process of emptying ourselves from established patterns of thought, from belief systems that have lost relevance, from an onslaught of random thoughts to discover a new insight.</p>
